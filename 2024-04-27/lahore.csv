0,Opposition boycotts Punjab Assembly proceedings in solidarity with wheat growers,Announced protest for Monday against poor wheat procurement policy.,"LAHORE: Opposition members in the Punjab Assembly boycotted house proceedings on Friday to show solidarity with wheat growers.
They also announced launching a protest drive from Monday against, what they said, poor wheat procurement policy of the incumbent government.
The issue of wheat procurement echoed in the house for the third day as treasury as well as opposition members were not satisfied with the assurances of the government about procurement of the grain from the local farmers.
They were worried that an unclear official procurement target and the unusual delay in the start of the procurement drive were crashing the local grain market to the disadvantage of growers.
Food Minister Bilal Yasin said the moisture level in the grain at present was quite high, up to 18 per cent, because of which his department could not buy the produce as when it would dry up and reduce its weight, it would cause a loss to the government.
Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan said the government had fixed the minimum support price of wheat at Rs3,900 per 40kg but it was being sold at Rs3,200 in the open market because the growers were not sure whether the department would purchase their produce from them unlike in the past.
He said billions of rupees of the farming community were lying with the middlemen, while sugarcane growers were also disturbed about the recovery of their dues from the mills.
Sunni Ittehad Council chief whip Rana Shehbaz said his party had boycotted proceedings of the house and would start a protest campaign from Monday to show solidarity with the growers being crushed by the present policy.
He said his party was in contact with all farmer groups to take them along in the protest.
Talking to the media, the speaker said the desire of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister to take over the federation was an attempt to lead the country to a chaos.
He regretted that since 2014, governments were being ousted due to the attempts made by one person to keep the country unstable.  
“There is only one person responsible for the disaster in the country and he is currently in jail,” he said in as apparent reference to PTI founder Imran Khan.

Identified as Zainab (9), the girl was employed at the house of the suspect, Salman, who claimed that she had suffered burns when a gas cylinder exploded in the kitchen.
Following the incident, Operations DIG Faisal Kamran visited the suspect’s house, along with other police officers.
During inquiry, it transpired that the employer did not intimate police about the incident, creating doubt about his conduct.
A police official says that Salman initially tried to provide her treatment at his house.
He said when the girl’s condition deteriorated, the employer took her to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her burns.
The official said that Zainab’s parents also told police they were not informed about the incident by her employer.  
In the light of the inquiry, the police arrested Salman and sent him behind the bars after lodging a case against him.
The girl’s body was shifted to the city morgue for the postmortem examination, he said, adding that the case has been handed over to the investigation police for further action.

ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed adjourned the hearing of the bail petitions without any progress due to the unavailability of the petitioner’s lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar.
An associate of Barrister Safdar requested the judge for an adjournment.
The judge allowed the request and adjourned the hearing till May 3 and also extended the bail of the former prime minister in cases of attack on the Jinnah House, Askari Tower and Shadman police station.
The judge on March 1 had confirmed the pre-arrest bail of Khan in four other cases, including murder of Zille Shah, attack on police outside Zaman Park, and torching offices of PML-N in Model Town and a container at Kalma Chowk on May 9, 2023.
An ATC on Aug 11, 2023, dismissed the pre-arrest bails of the PTI founding chairman in seven criminal cases over his non-appearance after he was jailed following his conviction in Toshakhana case.
Later, the Lahore High Court set aside the decision of the ATC and restored his bail petitions. The high court directed the trial court to decide all bail petitions afresh on merit.

3,Wearing uniform: Court seeks police order refusing case against CM,Petitioner’s lawyer says CM committed a cognizable offence and the police were duty-bound to register a case against her.,"LAHORE: A sessions court on Friday directed a petitioner to submit a copy of the police order refusing to register a case against Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for wearing police uniform.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muzaffar Nawaz Malik was hearing the petition filed by Waqar Ahmed, challenging the non-registration of a case against the chief minister for wearing police uniform at the passing out ceremony of the policewomen.
Advocate Aftab Ahmad Bajwa, on behalf of the petitioner, argued that the Old Anarkali station house officer refused to lodge a case against the chief minister on the ground that the IGP and other senior police officers were also present on the occasion.
The judge directed the petitioner to submit a copy of the police officer’s refusal order by April 29.
Earlier, the petitioner’s lawyer argued the CM wore police uniform at the women police officials’ passing out event against the law that says no individual can wear the uniform of any institution (without being an employee of it). He said the CM committed a cognizable offence and the police were duty-bound to register a case against her and the officials who shared the stage with her.
He asked the court to order police to register an FIR against the CM on the application of the petitioner.

4,Imran says PTI will not strike any deal,Asks people to break shackles of slavery: party leaders assigned the task to lead protest rallies stay away,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Imran Khan said on Friday his party  “will not strike a deal with those who kept the nation in chains of  slavery”.  
PTI central media department said “in a special  message to the nation through the party office-bearers who met him in  Adiala jail on Friday, PTI founder chairman Imran Khan urged people to  break shackles of slavery and stand up to achieve Haqeeqi Azadi, because  freedom has never been gifted to any nation.”
The PTI chief’s  statement was in quiet contrast to a claim made by party leader Shehryar  Afridi who told Geo News in the evening that the party would soon hold a  dialogue with the army chief and ISI DG instead of talking to those who  returned to parliament through vote fraud.
Khan said since a  slave nation had no future, he was ready to render any sacrifice  whatsoever for nation’s true independence and would not strike a deal  with those who kept the nation in chains of slavery.

Asks people to break shackles of slavery: party leaders assigned the task to lead protest rallies stay away

He said he  had laid the foundation of PTI on April 25, 1996, on the principles of  justice, humanity and self-esteem. The PTI has become the strongest and  most formidable political force in the country despite all fascism and  coercion.“I believe that once my nation is free in true sense, no one  will be able to stop Pakistan from becoming a great country,” Imran Khan  vowed.
However, Khan said a “king of the jungle was the main  stumbling block and impediment in the path to true freedom, who  established the worst dictatorship in the country by flouting the  constitution and law of the country.
“The king of jungle’s  stubbornness and ego to run the country according to his will instead of  the constitution and law of the land became a source of destruction of  the country’s economy, government system and even democracy and the  judiciary,” he was quoted as saying in the central media release.
“Mr  Khan said it was high time that every member of the nation should play  his/her role to stop the ongoing destruction of the country and added  that they should utilise their strength and resources given by Allah for  achieving the true independence of the country.
“I will render  any sacrifice to achieve Haqeeqi Azadi and will never compromise on my  own freedom as well of the nation come what may,” he asserted in his  message.
The PTI founding chairman said the nation should keep in  mind that he had been jailed for the last nine months in absolutely  bogus, false, fabricated and baseless cases.
RALLIES: PTI staged  peaceful protest demonstrations and rallies in all districts in Punjab  against “worst-ever rigging” in general and by-elections despite an  overnight crackdown on the residences of party leaders and active  workers.
According to reports, police arrested scores of party  workers from their residences as well as from protest rallies in  different parts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Daska,  Shakargarh, and other districts. Several PTI leaders were put under  house arrest.
While police blocked various roads and set up  pickets, some party MPAs and second-tier leaders brought out small  rallies in their respective constituencies.
The protesters  demanded that the public mandate stolen by the incumbent PML-N  government in connivance with the Election Commission of Pakistan be  returned to elected candidates.
They demanded that the PTI’s election symbol “Bat” as well as its due reserved seats of women and minorities be returned.
The  PTI’s main leadership, including almost all leaders nominated in a  committee, constituted to plan and organise protests, were conspicuous  by their absence from the protest rallies.
Small isolated rallies  were held in different streets, but Lahore largely remained clam as is  the case since May 9. The small protest activity in Lahore yet again  reminded that that the PTI has no crowd-puller available in Lahore as  they were either incarcerated or in self-proclaimed hiding.
PTI  Central Punjab secretary general Hammad Azhar, who did not appear at any  protest rally in the province, stated that the party leaders,  legislators, ticket-holders and workers staged protest rallies across  the province to demand and reclaim masses’ stolen mandate. He said the  founder chairman had awakened the masses through his political struggle  and now they were ready to claim their due rights.
Mr Azhar  condemned police raids on party leaders’ residences, outhouses and  offices in a bid to harass them on the instructions of “fake and stolen  mandate” chief minister. He said the IGP would not be able to push PTI  leaders, workers and supporters against the wall.
PTI Punjab  information secretary Shaukat Basra said the nation had awakened and  would raise its voice at all forums to get its due right.
According  to reports and videos shared by the PTI, police raided thrice the  outhouse of PTI ticket-holder for PP-151 Hammad Ali Awan to block  protests against rigging in the April 21 by-elections. Similarly, police  raided the residence and outhouse of PP-60 MPA Kaleem Ullah Khan and  allegedly misbehaved with women and his employees.

5,Committee formed to mull over local govt law,"LAHORE: To pave way for the next local bodies elections in Punjab, the provincial government has, in the first ...","LAHORE: To pave way for the next local bodies elections in Punjab, the provincial government has, in the first phase, constituted a 20-member committee to deliberate upon the Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA), 2022, and propose amendments to the existing law or present a draft of the new local government Act.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had formed the government in Punjab in 2018 with a slogan to devolve powers to the grassroots level through holding local government elections, but it failed to keep the promise.
The committee constituted by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz will be convened by Punjab local government and community development department (LG&CD) minister Zeeshan Rafique and schools education minister Rana Sikandar Hayat. It has been directed to complete the assigned task within 15 days and present its recommendations to the chief minister.
The committee members include 14 MPAs, other than the two ministers. The MPAs are, Chaudhry Iftikhar Hussain Chhachhar, Salman Naeem, Muhammad Ahmad Khan Leghari, Ghazali Saleem Butt, Ziaullah Shah, Amjad Ali Javed, Sardar Muhammad Asim Sher Maken, Ahmed Iqbal, Ghazanfar Abbas Cheena, Raees Nabeel, Raja Muhammad Aslam Khan, Ghulam Murtaza, Kanwal Pervaiz Chaudhry and Salma Butt.
Punjab LG&CD department Secretary Mian Shakeel Ahmad will act as a member and secretary to the committee. He will also ensure administrative and secretariat support to the committee.
The law and parliamentary affairs department Secretary Asif Bilal Lodhi, as well as two lawyers – Moazzam Ali Shah and Usama Khawar Ghumman – have also been nominated as the committee members.
The committee has been constituted on a summary moved by the LG&CD department to look into the existing local government laws, update these for legislation and go for holding of much-awaited elections (of local bodies) in the province.
The local government elections are due in the province for the past several years.
The PTI government had dissolved the local governments created under the PLGA 2013 on May 4, 2019 as the law was repealed upon the promulgation of the PLGA 2019. Though the PTI government had recreated the local governments and appointed administrators on May 4, 2019 – some 30 months ahead of the completion of the LG representatives’ tenures, the Supreme Court had declared the PLGA 2019’s Section 3 ultra vires to the Constitution. Later, the PTI’s provincial government had restored the local governments under the PLGA 2013.
By February 2022, the PTI government had claimed to have finalised the PLGA 2021 draft and tabled it in the Punjab Assembly, allowing the opposition (PML-N) to express its reservations as a part of democratic process.
Under the PLGA draft law prepared in 2022, the PTI government had plans to legislate and hold direct elections to elect mayors in 11 metropolitan corporations (of major cities) and chairmen in districts.
The PTI government also wanted to use Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the local government elections to eliminate rigging. However, the introduction of EVMs in elections remains a distant dream as the Feb 8 general elections and April 21 by-elections in Punjab were held through manual voting practices. The PTI leaders and workers alleged massive rigging in these elections.

Deceased student’s mother Rabia Bibi had moved the court. The court directed the police to share the FIR after case registration. 
Earlier, the Pakpattan police said Waqar, along with his two accomplices, looted a resident of Malkan Hans and, while fleeing on a motorcycle, had an encounter with Sadar and Farid Nagar police mobile teams. 
Later, the police registered an FIR at Farid Nagar police station, stating that Waqar, of neighbourhood Faridabad, was injured by his companion’s firing and succumbed to his injuries while being shifted to the Pakpattan District Headquarters Hospital and Sahiwal Teaching Hospital.  
The FIR said his two accomplices fled. 
However, Waqar’s family and friends denied the police’s narrative. They said Waqar went out for a haircut and was killed by the Sadar police. Even police records showed that Waqar had no criminal history. At that time, the family staged protests at Jamal Chowk, blocking traffic for seven hours.  
They placed the body at the DPO office and demanded a case against the police officials involved in the fake encounter.  
Under family pressure and protest, DPO Tariq Walayt formed a committee to conduct a judicial inquiry into the incident. After Eid holidays, Rabia Bibi moved the court for the registration of the case. The court declared police report as fabricated. 
On the other hand, the Farid Nagar police registered a cross version of Rabia Bibi’s complaint in the previous FIR against SHO Ashiq, constables Ahmed Khan, Muhammad Waqas and Liaquat Ali and one unidentified person from Sadar police. The police have yet to arrest anyone.

10,10 Punjab districts gear up for special polio campaign,"In Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad, the campaign will last seven days, and in other districts, it will run for five days.","LAHORE: District health authorities must dedicate their time and resources to the special polio campaign starting on Monday to prevent the local circulation of the polio virus in the province.
Head of the polio programme in Punjab and Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Khizer Afzaal said this at a readiness meeting on Friday ahead of the sub-national polio campaign scheduled to begin on April 29 in 10 districts of Punjab.
The districts include Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, Sheikhupura, Okara, and Mianwali. While in Rawalpindi, Mianwali, and Sheikhupura, the campaign will be partially held, all areas of the rest of the districts will be fully covered.
In Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad, the campaign will last seven days, and in other districts, it will run for five days. 
The last two days of the campaign will be allocated to cover the leftover children. Over 67,000 polio workers will participate in the campaign, including 60,000 mobile team members.
Mr Khizer urged district officials to ensure full focus on polio during the campaign, optimal utilization of SNIDs, and ensuring that no child is left unvaccinated, especially in vulnerable and priority communities.
He inquired about the status of polio team members’ training and expressed displeasure about some districts lagging on this indicator. 
He instructed the officials to take polio team training seriously and submit updated status reports by the second half of the day.
Mr Afzaal also expressed concerns about the low number of government accountable teams in some districts, stating that the low numbers could negatively affect the campaign’s quality. 
He instructed the officials to work with line departments and involve more government personnel in the polio teams before the campaign.
The EOC coordinator stressed the importance of maintaining the quality of polio human resources and urged provincial monitors to prepare comprehensive reports on the quality of polio human resources. These reports should be submitted to the EOC after returning from the campaign.
He directed the CEOs to personally monitor the performance of polio teams; otherwise, they would be held accountable for any gaps.
During the meeting, the EOC coordinator urged district health authorities to leave their offices during polio campaigns and personally monitor the campaign to ensure timely action.
Mr Afzaal expressed concern about the beginning of the summer season, stating that hot weather presents challenges in maintaining the vaccine cold chain and efficacy. 
He directed district officials to ensure vaccine efficacy up to doorsteps by taking concrete measures, frequent monitoring checks, and saving an adequate quantity of ice packs.
He also underscored the importance of transit points, stating that the deployed teams need to be alert and provided with adequate security. 
He called upon Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur CEOs to remain in touch with polio officials in their districts to ensure security for polio teams in remote areas.

Sialkot police spokesperson says that the traffic police have opened driving schools in the four tehsils of the district --Sambaryal, Daska, Pasrur and Sialkot -- to raise awareness about traffic rules and road safety.  
He says the traffic police department is issuing driving licences to those who clear test in these driving schools.  
Sialkot Traffic Sector In Charge Rubina Haider told Dawn that people mostly respect women traffic wardens and did not misbehave with them. However, she says, some complaints have been received regarding misbehaviour by drivers of commercial transport vehicles with the women traffic wardens. She adds that many of these commercial drivers offer bribe when stopped for any violation, but women wardens discourage such practices.  
Ms Saima, Sector In-charge Sambaryal, says she volunteered for the field duty, adding that people respect female wardens more than they show for male officers.  Two local businessmen, Amin Awan and Atif Ali say that women wardens can play an important role in reducing violation of traffic rules and speeding. 
DPO Iqbal told Dawn that it is for the first time that women wardens have been  assigned field duties in Sialkot, hoping the initiative will give  positive results. 
He says the initiative has been taken as per the vision of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, adding that the move will help boost self-confidence among women drivers.
He says that due to the women wardens, women will also feel safe while driving independently on the roads.  
He says a driving school has been opened in the Government Girls College University of Sialkot, where female students will be trained and issued licences after clearing test so they can independently drive to the varsity.
