0,Senate sees calls for shunning politics of confrontation,Sherry advises PTI to take up rigging claims in court; Irfan Siddiqui claims no political prisoners in the country; Ali Zafar,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate retained conciliatory aura for the second consecutive day on Friday with calls for burying the politics of confrontation and strengthening the parliamentary democracy.  
PPP’s parliamentary party leader Senator Sherry Rehman while opening discussion on President Asif Ali Zardari’s address to the joint sitting of parliament reiterated his message of turning a new page in history to address the challenges facing the nation.  
“We all should welcome President Asif Ali Zardari’s address in which he called on all political leaders to turn a new page, hold dialogue and aim for the much-needed political reset.”  
She said the president’s stress on political dialogue, unity and an end to polarisation is the only way forward in these challenging circumstances. 

Sherry advises PTI to take up rigging claims in court; Irfan Siddiqui claims no political prisoners in the country; Ali Zafar laments bulldozing of bills  

Speaking about the PPP leadership, she said the PPP had a history of rendering sacrifices but it never degraded the dignity of the state. 
“After the martyrdom of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto faced severe hardships yet she never created problems for the country and people. Asif Ali Zardari was in jail for 14 years. Yet, Asif Ali Zardari never took political revenge from anyone and there was no political prisoner in his previous tenure,” she remarked. 
Cautioning against the politics of hatred, she called upon all the stakeholders to heed President Zardari’s call for a new legacy based on unity and cooperation.  
Referring to allegations of poll rigging, she advised the PTI to approach the courts, but said they must not expect favourable decisions all the time. 
She pointed out that polls have always been controversial in Pakistan, adding that the 2018 elections had even been called the ‘RO’s elections’.  
Advice to PTI 
PML-N parliamentary leader Senator Irfan Siddiqui urged the PTI to hold talks to solve the crises facing the country. He noted that politicians faced ups and downs and governments came and went but they have to leave some traditions and legacy for future generations. 
Talking about reconciliation, he said it was a two-way process. “We are ready to extend an olive branch to PTI and let us shake hands,” he said and urged the party of ex-prime minister Imran Khan to “come forward for Pakistan and let us sit together”.  
Referring to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s reported warning that he would “attack” Islamabad in protest, Mr Siddiqui urged PTI to do away with such tone. If PTI can shake hands with its worst political enemies such as Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, then why it cannot sit with the incumbent government in the interest of the country, he asked.  
Mr Siddiqui said there is no political prisoner in the country at present, explaining that the PTI founder was behind bars after having being convicted in various cases.  
PTI response 
PTI’s parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar stressed that there was dire need of working together while keeping aside political differences or else matters of grave concern would be forgotten and ignored. He said parliament had lost its integrity and become a laughing stock for foreign countries because it was discharging its functions in total negation of the rules of business. 
Underlining the need for doing away with the practice of ‘bulldozing of legislation’, he said there were laws that were neither discussed nor referred to any committee or allowed to be reviewed or read by the senators before being passed hastily only for the benefit of a few.  
He said such like instances had seriously damaged the prestige of legislature which further culminated in people losing faith in parliament. 
He said it was the responsibility of the Senate to bring forth, discuss and debate internal and external issues of grave importance so that every member can share his opinion.  
“Based on these opinions, the government can then arrive at the best possible solutions in the best interest of Pakistan and its people,” he remarked. 
He said treasury benches should have a heart to bear criticism, assuring that criticism from his party would be based on facts.  
He recalled that the Quaid-i-Azam had proposed the structure of Pakistan’s democracy on the basis of four principles — rule of law, good governance, unity and diversity and, above all, a society built on tolerance. According to the PTI senator, Pakistan has failed in adopting these basic principles.  
Speaking about Iran’s attack on Israel, he urged the government to brief the house about the recent visit of Iranian president to Pakistan.  
He also blasted the ECP for allegedly trying to throw PTI out of the political process.

1,Mohsin Naqvi unmoved by stiff PTI criticism,"Opposition leaders accuse interior minister of ""perpetuating political victimisation”.","• Opposition leaders accuse interior minister of ‘perpetuating political victimisation’
• Speaker expels official from gallery; admonishes bureaucrats for ‘not taking parliament seriously’
ISLAMABAD: Opposition PTI members on Friday launched a scathing attack on Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, accusing him of perpetuating political victimisation, after the minister made a long-awaited appearance in the National Assembly.
First, it was PTI’s Jamshed Dasti who lambasted Mr Naqvi for the alleged abuse of power and targeting of rivals. Then, Opposition Leader Omar Ayub denounced “the constant witch-hunting of PTI leaders and activists by the Punjab and Islamabad police on the directives of Mr Naqvi, when he was the caretaker chief minister of Punjab and now when he has assumed the charge of interior minister”.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar also accused the police of disrupting the party’s founding day event in Islamabad on Thursday and demanded an action against those who even took away a cake which the party had arranged for the occasion.
However, Mr Naqvi did not respond to the allegations and kept meeting members who approached him for the resolution of their problems.
“The Punjab police have become an indisciplined and mercenary force because of the deeds of Dr Usman [IG Punjab] and Mohsin Naqvi,” said Mr Ayub while “condemning” the police action against the party workers in various cities on Friday as the party had called for protest against the alleged rigging in the April 21 by-polls.
He questioned Mr Naqvi’s election as senator as an independent candidate, stating that earlier he was functioning as an “illegal caretaker chief minister of Punjab”. He used the word ‘tout’ for the Punjab IGP and called him a “corrupt person.”
Deputy Speaker Mustafa Shah, however, expunged the word ‘tout’ from the proceedings.
Recalling the Bahawalnagar army-police row, he said it seemed a message was being sent to people that if they saw the police raiding any premises without a warrant, they should treat the cops in the same manner.
Earlier, Mr Dasti said he had received information that police had surrounded his residence in Muzaffargarh.
“We ask the interior minister has he not tired of beating us? Expel us from the country,” said Mr Dasti.
He also asked the chair to accept his privilege motion against the Nadra chairman for not responding to his telephone calls.
Bureaucracy under fire Earlier, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and members expressed anger over the absence of ministers and senior officials from the proceedings.
At the outset, lawmakers from both sides of aisle drew the speaker’s attention to the empty front rows and criticised the government for not taking the proceedings seriously.
Before taking up a calling attention notice about the petroleum division, the chair inquired if a senior official from the ministry concerned was present.
Upon learning that a director-level official was present, Mr Sadiq expelled him from the gallery and asked him to send an officer of not less than a joint secretary level, within five minutes.
Some MNAs, including PTI’s Riaz Fatiana, said they had never seen the interior minister in the house. The speaker responded that he would himself talk to the interior minister and ask him to attend the session.
Then the speaker started giving floor to members to speak on points of order till the time ministers and senior officials returned to the house.
The speaker also admonished a joint secretary of the petroleum ministry when he entered the house some 50 minutes after the start of the session.
“We apologise that we bothered you and called you … we all have been waiting for you. The session started at 11am. Next time, if you want, we will shower flowers on you when you will come here,” the speaker said, sarcastically.
“If you take parliament this seriously, then next time secretaries will have to come and [no one] less than secretaries. I am sending letters again that please don’t take parliament non-seriously,” he said.
Around the same time, the interior minister entered the hall and the speaker asked him to give a hearing to those who had spoken through points of order.
The deputy speaker also administered oath to Faisal Amin Gandapur, who won the recent by-election on the seat from D.I. Khan.
The National Assembly will now meet on Monday evening.

2,Warrant out for Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s arrest,Police directed to produce him in court today.,"QUETTA: A judicial magistrate on Friday issued arrest warrant for Mahmood Khan Achakzai, chairman of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party who had contested the presidential election as candidate of opposition parties, for not appearing in a case pertaining to illegal occupation of government land and alleged interference in the duty of government officials.
While issuing the arrest warrant for Mr Achakzai, the judicial magistrate directed the police to produce him before the court on April 27 (today).
The warrant was issued after the PkMAP chief failed to appear in his court on April 22 in connection with the FIR registered by the Gawalmandi police under Sections 447 (criminal trespass), 448 (house-trespass) and 34 (with common intention) of Pakistan Penal Code.
The local administration of Quetta along with the officials of the Board of Revenue and police had conducted a raid on the plot opposite Mr Achakzai’s residence, where a security guard put up resistance to them. The officials claimed that the plot belonged to the government and the police had not raided his residence.

Police directed to produce him in court today

However, the PkMAP has alleged that the police raided the house of the party chief who was the presidential candidate without justification and arrested his personal guard.
PkMAP Central Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal said that a heavy police contingent raided his house “without any magistrate” in violation of the people’s right to privacy. He alleged the raid came after Achakzai had exposed rigging in the general elections and his nomination as a presidential candidate by the opposition parties.

4,SC finds flaws in police investigation techniques,Suggests reliance on forensic science to improve prosecution; upholds LHC order acquitting murder accused.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday emphasised the need for making concerted efforts on part of the police force to shift its investigation techniques by introducing and relying on forensic science and accordingly train specialised officers in this field.  
“The cornerstone of criminal justice system is the effective functionality of the investigating agency and prosecution since a faulty investigative process will continuously dampen trust and confidence in the criminal justice system,” observed Justice Ayesha A. Malik in a judgement she wrote.  
Justice Malik was a member of a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, which had taken up an appeal by Mohammad Ramzan against the July 4, 2013 Lahore High Court order acquitting Khizar Hayat of murder charges by not confirming the death sentence awarded to the accused.  
On April 28, 2009, then Khushab additional sessions judge had awarded death sentence to Khizar Hayat for murdering Mohammad Hayat. The accused challenged his conviction and got acquittal by the high court.  

Suggests reliance on forensic science to improve prosecution; upholds LHC order acquitting murder accused 

“Time has come for the investigation agency to recognise inherent flaws and concerns in its methodology and it needs to work towards specialising its investigative functions by separating the same from other police duties,” emphasised Justice Malik in her judgement.  
She observed that the entire case of the prosecution relied on the ocular accounts which were fraught with material contradictions uncorroborated by available evidence. Moreover, she said, the presence of witnesses at the crime scene was highly doubtful and questionable.  
The principle of fair trial and due process under Article 10A of the Constitution, Justice Malik emphasised, specifically mandated that the accused be equitably treated, investigated and prosecuted in accordance with the law.  
“But in the case at hand, it was revealed that the entire prosecution evidence was marred by inherent improbabilities and material defects, aside from concerns about the credibility of the witnesses,” the judgement regretted.  
“It is the duty of the prosecution to establish the guilt against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt,” it said, adding that the facts and circumstances of the present case clearly cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution’s case, which had failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, which entitled him to the presumption of innocence by law.  
“It is essential to emphasise the importance of forensic science in the criminal justice system,” the judgement said, adding that forensic dealt with ‘the application of scientific techniques to provide objective, circumstantial evidence’.  
“Forensic is a science ‘of interest to the legal system’ whose objective is to ascertain what happened in the recent past. Forensic science means nothing more than the science which is used in the courts of law for the purposes of detection and prosecution of crime,” the judgement recalled.  
“This science plays a significant role in the criminal justice system by providing data that can be used to assess the degree of guilt of a suspect.”  
In the present case, the judgement said, the prosecution had not established the motive, adding that the high court’s view was correct in which it stated that in the absence of any corroborating evidence, it did not appear to be a sound and reasonable motive as stated by the prosecution for the commission of the offence.  
The apex court dismissed the present criminal petition with an observation that the findings rendered by the LHC did not suffer from any flaw or error.

5,28 Levies officials sacked for failing duty during Kohlu re-poll,"Personnel deployed to ensure security failed to report to their stations, where the polling process was severely disrupted by violent incidents.","QUETTA: The government has sacked 28 members of the Levies Force, including a naib resaldar, five constables and 22 soldiers, for neglecting their assigned duties during the re-polling in the provincial constituency PB-9 in Kohlu district.
The decision, effective immediately, was announced by the deputy commissioner of Kohlu, Naqibullah Kakar.
These personnel were deployed to ensure the security of four polling stations during the elections scheduled on April 24, following orders from the Election Commission of Pakistan.
However, they failed to report to their stations, where the polling process was severely disrupted by violent incidents, including rocket attacks, landmine explosions, and gunfire, preventing the polling staff from reaching the locations.
“Upon investigation, these Levies personnel failed to give any reason for not reaching the place of duty. They have been dismissed from the service with immediate effect,” Mr Kakar said.
He said strict disciplinary actions had been initiated against the absent employees, stressing that those who neglect the protection of life and property did not deserve leniency.

6,"Bugti vows to protect govt assets, improve urban infrastructure in Quetta",Urges citizens to support govt’s initiatives aimed at city's public spaces.,"QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Friday committed to safeguarding government-owned assets and properties, including those under the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) and other local bodies, valued at billions of rupees.
His remarks came amid ongoing issues involving unauthorised occupancy and non-payment of rent by tenants of these properties.
Talking to the media after visiting Quetta’s sole parking plaza, built by the QMC, Mr Bugti said that assets owned by the corporation and other institutions would not be wasted under any circumstances and urged all citizens, including lawyers, to support the government’s initiatives aimed at improving the city.
He highlighted the misuse of government properties, noting that many occupants have long defaulted on nominal rents.

Urges citizens to support govt’s initiatives aimed at improving Quetta’s public spaces

Mr Bugti revealed that the parking plaza, despite being a seven-storey facility, lacks elevators and has unfinished sections, leading to the suspension of the contractor and the launch of an inquiry.
He also outlined plans to improve the city’s infrastructure, including the construction of a new hotel on the plaza’s rooftop through a public-private partnership.
He said the government would also establish another parking plaza in the old meat market’s available space, aiming to overcome roadside problems and provide safe parking places for commuters.
He said a lifter would be provided to traffic police on the same public-private partnership model as there is a single lifter with the police in Quetta.
The chief minister said that efforts would be made to improve the condition of Baldia plaza and directed to revise its rent agreements as the QMC is collecting rent on a monthly basis. 
He said that Kandhari Bazar, Jinnah Road and encircling roads would be declared as walking streets.
Mr Bugti said that there is a lack of resources in Balochistan and the available resources are not being used properly, which does not benefit the public. “We will improve Quetta’s sewerage, parking and drainage systems,” he said.
The chief minister also pointed out the significant increase in revenue from the Circular Road parking plaza — from Rs6,000 to Rs1 million monthly — since the government took active steps to better manage the facility.
However, he criticised the corruption that has plagued local development projects, including a contractor who fled with an advance payment.
He stressed the need for community involvement in maintaining public cleanliness and highlighted plans to tackle corruption in road maintenance funding. Each district has been allocated Rs5 million for this purpose, he said.
Expressing his regret over the occupants of the government-leased properties, he said that the rent of Baldia cafe has not been paid for the last seven months, which must be submitted to the office concerned.
“We must introduce a new mechanism under our current resources, and we can generate revenue through the Mines and Minerals Department and Metropolitan Corporation,” he added.

7,PTI protesters in Quetta denounce ‘poll rigging’,"Demands release of Imran, Qureshi; rally staged despite ban on gatherings.","QUETTA:  Like other parts of the country, workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), including female supporters, staged a protest in Quetta on Friday against alleged rigging in the February 8 general elections and the arrest of party’s founder Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.
A large number of party workers, led by acting president of PTI Balochistan Khurshid Kakar, provincial vice president Sardar Khadim Hussain Wardag, Noor Khan Khilji, and others, gathered at the lawns of Quetta Metropolitan Corporation to take out a rally. However, police did not allow the rally due to the imposition of Section 144 in the city.
Later, the party workers and supporters, carrying party flags and placards, gathered in front of Quetta Press Club, where they chanted slogans against the government and demanded the immediate release of Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi, who, according to PTI supporters, were “unjustly sentenced in fake cases”.
During the event, party leaders including Asif Tareen, former MNA, Munawara Munir, Mahwah, and others, said that the current rulers are so afraid of PTI that they see PTI even in their dreams at night.

Demands release of Imran, Qureshi; rally staged despite ban on gatherings

They emphasised that in the general elections, the people of Pakistan voted for PTI’s candidates, echoing PTI Chairman’s call, but through rigging and violence, PTI’s mandate was “snatched away”, insulting the people’s votes. They expressed that the people did not accept governments with fake mandates. Such a government cannot save the country from the current crises but instead complicates the lives of the poor people due to the wrong policies of the current rulers, they added.
They demanded that false cases against PTI chairman and other leaders be immediately dismissed, and they be released with dignity. 
The PTI leadership cannot be intimidated by false cases; their spirits are high, and by the grace of Allah, the day is not far when Mr Khan and other leaders will be acquitted of “false cases” with honour.

8,Urgent construction of Karachi-Chaman road ordered,Balochistan High Court orders National Highway Authority to explain why Rs19 billion fund has not been utilised.,"QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court has ordered National Highway Authority (NHA) officials to explain why the Rs19 billion fund has not been utilised and to immediately begin the construction on the Karachi-Quetta-Chaman (N-25) dual carriageway. 
A division bench of the BHC, comprising Justice Abdullah Baloch and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, took notice of the incomplete construction of the dual carriageway on the Quetta-Karachi National Highway. The bench directed NHA officials to submit pre-qualification proposals via tender by May 26, 2024, for the construction of the N-25 Karachi-Quetta-Chaman highway, covering the Karachi-Uthal, Uthal-Kararo, and Wadh-Khuzdar sections.
Officials from the Planning and Development Department, Economics Division, Finance Division, Islamabad, and the NHA appeared before the court.
The court was told that the government had allocated Rs19bn to the NHA for the Karachi-Quetta-Chaman highway, N-25, but the NHA had failed to utilise this amount. The court considered this to be negligence and incompetence on the part of the department rather than simply the non-utilisation of the allocated funds.
