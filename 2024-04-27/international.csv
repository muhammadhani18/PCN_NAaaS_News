0,Iran ally Syria strives  to stay out of hostilities,"BEIRUT: Syria has avoided getting embroiled in the Gaza crisis, experts say, despite a strike on Iran’s Damascus...","BEIRUT: Syria has avoided getting embroiled in the Gaza crisis, experts say, despite a strike on Iran’s Damascus consulate that threatened to ignite a regional conflagration.
The government of Syrian President Bashar al Assad is seeking to strike a delicate balancing act between Russia and Iran, which have propped it up during 13 years of civil war and helped it reclaim lost territory. Syria is part of the “axis of resistance” — an alliance of Iran-backed groups that has launched attacks on Israel or its alleged assets since October.
But its other main ally, Russia, maintains diplomatic ties with Israel and has pushed for stability in Syria’s south, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
“The Israelis clearly warned Assad that if Syria was used against them they would destroy his regime,” said a Western diplomat.
Recent months have seen a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, widely blamed on Israel, culminating in an April 1 raid that levelled Tehran’s consulate in Damascus and killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards, two of them generals.
That strike prompted Iran to launch a first-ever direct missile and drone attack against Israel on April 13-14 that sent regional tensions spiralling.
The attacks have also pushed Iran to reduce its military footprint throughout southern Syria, especially in areas bordering the Golan, a source close to Hezbollah said. 
Russia and UAE influence 
“Russia and the United Arab Emirates have urged (Assad) to stay away from the conflict,” said Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute.
Last year, Syria returned to the Arab fold, seeking better ties with wealthy Gulf states, in hopes they can help fund reconstruction _ although Western sanctions are likely to deter investment.
In 2018, the United Arab Emirates re-established ties with Syria, and it has been leading the charge to reintegrate Damascus.
Syria appears to have heeded Russia and the UAE’s call, and its border with the Golan Heights remains relatively calm despite a handful of strikes launched by Hezbollah-allied fighters.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor says that since the start of the Gaza war only 26 rocket attacks from Syria have targeted the Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981.
Most have landed in open areas, “which is read in Washington and elsewhere as a sort of code that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wants to stay out of the Gaza conflict”, Tabler said.
“Assad hopes the Arabs and the West will compensate him for his restraint, and the Russians are pushing him towards this path,” he said.
Earlier this month, Russia’s defence ministry said it had established an additional position in the Syrian part of the Golan, to “monitor the ceasefire and promote de-escalation”.
While massive demonstrations in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza took place in several Arab capitals, Damascus only saw a handful of small pro-Palestine rallies, witnesses said.

1,Gaza’s ‘miracle baby’ dies,"“She was born while her respiratory system wasn’t mature[...] She joined her family as a martyr,” says Dr Salama.","RAFAH: Relatives gathered by a tiny sandy grave in Gaza on Friday, where they had buried a baby girl who lived just a few days after doctors delivered her from the womb of her dying mother following an Israeli airstrike. The child, dubbed the “miracle baby”, had been given the names Sabreen, after her dead mother, and Rouh, which means “soul”.
Her mother, Sabreen al Sakani al Sheikh, 30-weeks pregnant, was seriously injured when the Israeli strike hit the family home in Rafah, the southernmost city in the besieged Gaza Strip, on Saturday night. The baby’s father Shukri and three-year-old sister Malak were killed.
Doctors delivered the baby by caesarean section, but the mother died of her wounds. Doctor Mohammad Salama, head of the emergency neo-natal unit at Emirati Hospital, who had been caring for the baby, said the infant suffered respiratory problems and a weak immune system, and died on Thursday.
“I and other doctors tried to save her, but she died. For me personally, it was a very difficult and painful day,” he told Reuters by phone. “She was born while her respiratory system wasn’t mature, and her immune system was very weak and that is what led to her death. She joined her family as a martyr,” Salama said.
“Maybe if it werent for the Israeli war on Gaza and the devastation of hospitals, we would have been able to help more children survive. But hospitals were damaged and others destroyed and our capabilities have become much limited.” 
More than 34,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been confirmed killed in the six-month-old war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel denies deliberately targeting civilians in its campaign to eradicate Hamas.
Much of Gaza has been laid to waste by Israeli bombardments and most of the enclave’s hospitals have been badly damaged, while those still operating are short of electricity, medicine sterilisation equipment and other supplies.
The baby’s grandmother had pleaded for the doctors to save her, to “keep the memory of her mother, father and sister alive, but it was God’s will that she died”, Salama said. Her uncle, Rami al-Sheikh Jouda, sat by her grave on Friday lamenting the loss of the infant and the others in the family. He said he had visited the hospital every day to check on the baby’s health. Doctors told him she had a respiratory problem but he did not think it was bad until he got a call from the hospital telling him the baby had died.

2,Erdogan postpones White House visit,"A new date will soon be set, says a Turkish official.","WASHINGTON: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan postponed a White House meeting with President Joe Biden, a source familiar with the situation and a Turkish official said on Friday of a visit that had been tentatively planned for May 9.
A new date will soon be set, the Turkish official said. The source familiar with the matter said it was unclear what prompted the postponement.
A US official noted that the meeting between the Nato allies had never been officially announced.
Representatives for the White House and the State Department had no immediate comment. Erdogan’s office also had no immediate comment on the postponement, reported earlier by Bloomberg.
The meeting would have been the first bilateral visit to Washington since 2019 when Erdogan met then-presidente Donald Trump, a Republican. He and Biden have met a few times at international summits and spoken by phone since the Democratic president took office in Jan 2021.
Ties between the US and Turkiye have been long strained by differences on a range of issues. While they have thawed since Ankara ratified Sweden’s Nato membership bid earlier this year, tensions persist over Syria and Russia and the Gaza crisis.
Erdogan visited Iraq this week. Last weekend, he met Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul, the first meeting between Erdogan and a Hamas delegation headed by Haniyeh since the gaza crisis unfolded on Oct 7.

3,Strike on Iraq gas complex kills four Yemenis,"""These repeated attacks must stop,"" says Kurdistan regional government spokesperson Peshawa Hawramani.","SULAIMANIYAH: Four Yemeni workers were killed in a drone attack on an Emirati-owned gas complex in Iraq’s northern autonomous region of Kurdistan on Friday.
The drone strike is the first deadly attack against the Khor Mor complex owned by the United Arab Emirates firm Dana Gas, which was hit several times in recent years. “Four Yemeni workers were killed and the field was severely damaged,” Kurdistan regional government spokesperson Peshawa Hawramani said. He said the attack would cause “power shortages”. “These repeated attacks must stop,” Hawramani added.
He called on the federal government in Baghdad to “find the perpetrators of this terrorist act”.
“A drone hit the site at approximately 6.45pm local time (1545 GMT),” said Ramak Ramadan, district chief of Chamchamal where the Khor Mor complex is located.
It “targeted a fuel storage tank”, he added.
The attack disrupted gas supply to the region’s power plants, resulting in the loss of 2500 megawatts of electricity.

4,World must act on neurotech revolution: experts,PARIS: The world is on the brink of a ‘neurotechnology revolution’ which has the potential to transform human...,"PARIS: The world is on the brink of a ‘neurotechnology revolution’ which has the potential to transform human health and welfare. However, urgent action is needed to protect brain data, experts told international media on Friday.
Medical breakthroughs in neurotechnology have enable paralysed individuals to walk again and deaf people to hear. Elon Musk’s firm, Neuralink, has publicly shared advances in brain implants. These developments are pushing the idea that they may one day be a lifestyle choice, as opposed to a medical device.
However, three experts gathered in Paris as part of an advisory panel for UNESCO (the UN’s agency for science and culture) told members of the press that the technology was already starting to proliferate. “This is really a crucial moment in human history,” said Marcello Ienca of the Technical University of Munich, in Germany.
“For the first time, we are developing the tools to understand and modify the functioning of the human brain and modify the functioning of the human brain.” Ienca and other experts interviewed by international media, specifically research scientist Nataliya Kosmyna and entrepreneur Ryota Kanai, stressed that the emerging field was ‘much wider than isolated medical breakthroughs’, with an array of consumer products already having entered markets.
They say the technology will be readily available in just a few years, though ethical guidance will be vital.
UNESCO has formed a group comprising 24 experts, to aid in drafting an “ethical framework” for the emerging technology. They hope to get agreement from UN member states by the end of next year.
‘A new species’ 
Musk has positioned himself at the centre of efforts to publicise neurotechnology, making eye-opening claims such as suggesting ‘humans could become telepathic’ or ‘upload their consciousnesses’ and in effect ‘live forever’.
Kosmyna is of the view that some of Musk’s more outlandish statements were probably aimed at attracting a greater number of potential investors, rather than projecting the reality of the technology.
Kosmyna, who designs and develops wearable devices such as glasses and hats that process brain data, says the field had the potential to transform humanity.
“I absolutely believe in the augmented human and that we are about to create a new species,” she said.
Although the experts have been skeptical of many of Musk’s claims, they say his firm is engaged in original work.
Ienca said Neuralink is the singular firm currently thinking of brain implants for the purpose of enhancement rather than to fulfill medical needs.
However, the experts say wearable technology is more likely to turn a profit in the short term. “You are not going to drill your skull, but you’re going to wear these (devices),” said Kosmyna.
She projects within the next five years, classrooms and other settings will be revolutionised by wearable technology that makes it possible for teachers to monitor their students and pick up whether they were bored, confused or engaged.
‘Two-tier planet’
UNESCO aims to ensure that all such technology, will respect human rights. “There can be no neurodata without neurorights,” sated UNESCO Director-General, Audrey Azoulay.
Ienca pointed out that Apple has recently patented technology, that enables the next generation of Airpods to gather brain data.
“Apple will be able to collect brain activity information continuously from hundreds of millions of people,” he said.
The data may be utilized in numerous ways, ranging from healthcare to marketing, and needs to be protected, he said. A secondary concern is to ensure that the products do indeed do, what their manufacturers say.
Devices currently on the market claim all kinds of powers, from solving mental health issues to boosting productivity at work.
“Even neuroscientists don’t know if that kind of claim is true,” said Kanai, CEO of Araya, a Japanese AI and neurotech firm. Addressing wider concerns, Ienca said that we could create a “two-tier planet” divided between “the enhanced and the non-enhanced”.
“This could be the end of human social cohesion as we know it,” he said.

5,Charles to resume public duties after cancer diagnosis,"""His majesty’s treatment programme will continue, but doctors are sufficiently pleased with the progress made,"" says Buckingham Palace spokesperson."," 

A HANDOUT photo issued by the royal household on Friday shows Britain’s King Charles III and Queen Camilla in the garden of Buckingham Palace, on April 10. The image was taken the day after their 19th wedding anniversary.—AFP

LONDON: Britain’s King Charles is set to return to public duties next week. This is a first-ever since he was diagnosed with cancer, as he makes good progress following treatment and a period of recuperation, the Buckingham Palace stated on Friday.
In February, the palace revealed that the 75-year-old king had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer. This was picked up by tests after he underwent a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate.
Although Charles continued with official state business, the diagnosis compelled him to postpone public engagements, begin treatment and prioritize rest.
“His majesty’s treatment programme will continue, but doctors are sufficiently pleased with the progress made so far that the king is now able to resume a number of public-facing duties,” a spokes­person at Buckingham Palace said.
“His majesty is greatly encouraged to be resuming some public-facing duties and very grateful to his medical team for their continued care and expertise.”
Although it was tad bit early to state for how long his cancer treatment would continue, the spokesperson said his doctors were “very encouraged by the progress made so far and remain positive about the king’s continued recovery”.
No further details regarding his condition or his treatment were shared, in line with the established stance on medical privacy.
Despite being pictured and filmed carrying out certain official duties in private, Charles’s only public appearance occurred last month. He greeted well-wishers in an impromptu walkabout after an Easter church service in Windsor. This had raised hopes that his health was improving.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak responded to the news of the king’s return to public duties, saying on social media site X: “Brilliant news to end the week!
Japanese emperor’s visit
To mark his return to public duties, Charles and his wife Queen Camilla are expected to visit a cancer treatment centre in London on Tuesday, the palace said. It was also confirmed that Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako would undertake a state visit in June.
However, Charles will not carry out his usual summer programme. His plans will be crafted in consultation with his medical team to minimise risks to recovery, the palace said.
The king’s absence has coincided with news that his daughter-in-law Kate was undergoing preventative chemotherapy.

6,Sri Lanka leases white elephant airport built with Chinese loans,The deal which gives Chinese company a 99-year lease raises fears about Beijing’s use of “debt traps” in exerting its influence abroad.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka said on Friday it had leased a white elephant international airport built with Chinese loans to a foreign joint venture, as the island nation’s bankrupt government seeks to offload loss-making assets.
The small airport near a wildlife sanctuary on the southern coast opened in 2013, but was immediately plagued by problems, and has been a running sore on state coffers since.
Government spokesman Bandula Gunawardana told reporters that cabinet had awarded a 30-year lease to a joint venture between India’s Shaurya Aeronautics and Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company.
He did not give further financial details, but said only four other companies had shown an interest in managing the isolated airport, which currently has no scheduled flights.
The airport is named after former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who borrowed heavily from China for infrastructure projects that quickly became commercial failures.
Since receiving an International Monetary Fund bailout last year, Sri Lanka has sought to privatise a host of loss-making state-owned enterprises.
The Mattala airport is in the middle of a migratory route for birds, with several aircraft forced to ground after striking airborne fowl.
Sri Lanka’s military was once forced to deploy hundreds of troops to clear deer, wild buffalo and elephants off the airport’s runway so it could continue operations.
The first foreign airline to operate out of the facility was Air Arabia in 2013, but it pulled out after six weeks of scheduled services.
Flydubai quit in June 2018 without giving a reason, but officials said poor passenger traffic may have spurred the budget carrier to leave.
National carrier Sri Lankan Airlines stopped flying to Mattala in 2015 soon after Rajapaksa was defeated in that year’s presidential election.
The company later said it saved $18 million annually by not flying to the isolated airport.
Debts to China are partly blamed for an unprecedented financial crisis which prompted Sri Lanka to default on its $46 billion foreign debt in 2022.
In 2017, unable to repay a huge Chinese loan, Sri Lanka allowed China Merchants Port Holdings to take over a nearby port at Hambantota.
The deal, which gave the Chinese company a 99-year lease, raised fears about Beijing’s use of “debt traps” in exerting its influence abroad.

7,Australian PM hails as hero Pakistani guard killed in Sydney,"SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed as hero Faraz Tahir, a Pakistani security guard killed in...","SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed as hero Faraz Tahir, a Pakistani security guard killed in Sydney while trying to stop a mass stabbing attack on April 13, in remarks delivered on Friday at a funeral attended by hundreds.
Tahir, who would have turned 31 this week, was on the first day of his job when he became one of six killed during the stabbing spree at a busy mall in beachside Bondi.
“Running toward danger, to protect people he had never even met, without doubt, he helped save lives that day,” Albanese said. “Without question, Faraz Tahir died a hero.” 
The ceremony was held before a crowd gathered outside the city’s Baitul Huda mosque, under a banner that read  “Love for all — hatred for none”.
Tahir arrived in Australia from Pakistan in early March, according to an association of Pakistanis in Sydney. 
Fellow security guard Muhammad Taha, injured while trying to stop the attacker, attended in a wheelchair after being released from hospital for the ceremony. 
He was the last to speak with Tahir as they ran towards the scene of the attack.
“We were trying to save people at that time and his last words were `Let’s find out what’s going on,’ so we rushed towards that area,” he said in comments reported by the Guardian newspaper.
Tahir’s brother, Mudasar Bashir, told reporters the two had spoken the evening before and promised to call the next day. They never spoke again.
“Even until now, we couldn’t believe that he’s no more,” he said at the funeral. “We are very proud of him because Islam, our religion, says that if you save even one human, you save all of humanity.” 
Joel Cauchi, a 40-year-old who suffered mental health issues, killed five women and Tahir in the mall on April 13 before being shot dead by police.

8,Two fighters killed in held Kashmir clashes,"Two soldiers and a civilian were injured, says a police official.","SRINAGAR: Two Kashmiri fighters were killed in India-occupied Kashmir during a firefight late on Thursday, the latest clash in the region during ongoing elections in India.
The gunbattle erupted in the northern town of Sopore when police and Indian soldiers cordoned off an area after receiving a tipoff about the presence of anti-Kashmiri fighters.
A police official said that bodies of two fighters had been seen at the site of the clash. Two soldiers and a civilian received bullet injuries, he added.
Thursday’s firefight came two days after soldiers clashed with anti-India fighters in adjacent Bandipore forested area, police said.
Two soldiers were injured in that exchange, media reported.
Earlier this month an anti-India fighter was killed in a clash with soldiers in the occupied territory’s south.
The latest clashes came during campaigning for India’s six-week-long general election, which continues through to June.

9,Russia attacks Ukraine’s rail lines to ‘disrupt supply of US arms’,Defence minister says Moscow plans to ramp up strikes on storage sites housing Western weaponry,"KYIV: Russia has been targeting Ukrainian railway lines via airstrikes, in order to disrupt the delivery of essential US weaponry to the front and complicate military logistics, an intelligence source based in Kyiv told reporters on Friday.
Russia’s defence minister told members of the press on Tuesday that Moscow plans to step up its attacks on logistics centres and storage sites, housing Western weaponry.
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced $6 billion in new military aid for Ukraine on Friday as Washington rushes to fill gaps left by months of limited American assistance.
The package is the second this week, following another valued at $1bn that was announced just after President Joe Biden signed a much-delayed bill to provide new funding for Ukraine as it struggles to hold back Russian advance.
“I’m... pleased to announce today an additional commitment of $6bn through our Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,” Austin told journalists, saying it will allow the procurement of new capabilities for Kyiv from US industry.

Defence minister says Moscow plans to ramp up strikes on storage sites housing Western weaponry

Ukrainian rail infrastructure was engaged by Russian strikes in the eastern Donetsk region, northe-astern Kharkiv region and central Cherkasy region, the national rail company said on Thursday.
The attack in Donetsk, which is the primary focus of Russia’s eastern offensive, claimed the lives of three electrical mechanics who worked for the railway company and wounded four more, it said.
In Kharkiv, bordering Russia, a strike hit the railway station within the city of Balakliia. The airstrike injured 13, including three rail workers, according to officials. Ukrainian officials seldom provide comprehensive statements about strikes on sensitive military targets. However, the Ukrainian intelligence source confirmed to media sources that attacks on rail infrastructure aimed to disrupt the supply of weaponry. “Also, the overall complication of our logistics,” the source added.
Outnumbering and outgunning Kyiv’s forces many times over, Russian troops gained battlefield momentum in February, after capturing the long-time bastion town, Avdiivka.
A Pentagon official stated on Thursday that the objective of United States aid was to “enable Ukraine to regain the initiative”.
Kyiv is faced with a shortage of manpower in the field of battle and questions persist over the strength of its fortifications along a sprawling 1,000-km frontline.
Russia has periodically targeted rail infrastructure since the war broke out, about 26 months ago.
Ukrzaliznytsia, the railway company, had temporarily withheld all deliveries to the southern Black Sea port of Chornomorsk, earlier this month. It cited no reason for the decision. 
Ukrainian media outlets reported that Russian attacks could have damaged railway tracks which connect the port’s cargo terminals.

10,Calls for mosque demolition weigh on Muslim  voters in India,MATHURA: Muslim teacher Tasleem Qureshi’s walk to the polls on Friday took her past the yellow barricades and...,"MATHURA: Muslim teacher Tasleem Qureshi’s walk to the polls on Friday took her past the yellow barricades and police cordon guarding a mosque _ a looming flashpoint in India’s religious divide.
Her hometown Mathura is the site of the Shahi Idgah, which Hindus believe was built over the birthplace of the deity Krishna.
Hindu activists want to “reclaim” the site in a campaign endorsed by members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
“The BJP keeps saying that the Shahi Idgah will cease to exist after the elections,” Qureshi, 48, said.
“We will not let that happen and we will protect it with our lives,” she said.
Mathura is one of several locations across India’s northern heartlands where activists have sought to replace centuries-old Islamic monuments with Hindu temples.
In January, Modi presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to Ram in the northern city of Ayodhya on the grounds of the centuries-old Babri mosque, razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.
Modi told an audience of thousands at a glitzy ceremony attended by Bollywood celebrities and cricket stars that India was “creating the genesis of a new history”.
Construction of the temple fulfilled a long-standing demand of Hindu activists and was widely celebrated across India, with extensive television coverage and street parties. Jubilant Hindu activists had proclaimed when the mosque was destroyed that more would follow, identifying the Shahi Idgah in Mathura as one of their future targets.
Modi’s opponents accuse his Hindu-nationalist government of marginalising India’s 220-million-plus Muslims.
He was accused last weekend of “blatantly targeting” the coomunity in a campaign speech in which he claimed his opponents had once pledged that Muslims had “first right over the nation’s wealth”.
‘Most important issue’ 
Temples small and large line Mathura’s narrow, pot-holed streets, teeming with young men offering guided tours for pilgrims.
The street leading to the mosque has for decades been guarded by a stern, round-the-clock police detachment to prevent vandalism.
A polling station nearby is testament to the close quarters in which the city’s two main communities live, with women in Muslim dress voting alongside saffron-clad Hindu priests.
Microcosm of religious divide
But with Hindus accounting for more than 80 per cent of Mathura’s population, its religious divide is a microcosm of the one across India at large.
Its parliamentary seat has been held by the BJP since Modi was first elected in 2014, represented by movie star Hema Malini, and the Ayodhya temple’s inauguration has galvanised Hindu voters in the city who support the mosque’s removal.
Gokul Prasad, an electrician, said Modi’s inauguration of the Ayodhya temple was the “single most important issue” of the election campaign.
“Since we live in Mathura so close to the Shahi Idgah, we will obviously vote for Modi,” the 50-year-old said.
The fate of the Shahi Idgah has also mobilised the city’s Muslims. But several said they had lined up to vote on Friday only to find their names were missing on the electoral rolls. “They told me neither I nor my husband can vote as our names are not there,” said 55-year-old Rehana Qureshi, no relation to Tasleem, outside a polling booth.

The young woman was stabbed in the city of Ramla and taken to hospital, police and paramedics said. They said the attacker was killed, without giving details.
“We received an injured woman from gunshot and stabbing wounds in her 20s,” Ortal Sheffer, a doctor at the Shamir Medical Centre said in a video statement shared by the hospital.
Sheffer, the doctor, did not specify how the woman sustained the gunshot wounds, but said she was in a stable condition.

Itamar Ben Gvir was returning to Tel Aviv after addressing the media in a nearby town where a woman was stabbed and her attacker shot dead

On his way back from addressing journalists at the scene, minister Ben Gvir and three other people were injured in a spectacular car crash.
“Four additional injuries arrived as a result of the overturning of a vehicle, including Minister Itamar Ben Gvir,” Sheffer said.
They “arrived in light conditions”, but will remain in hospital for overnight supervision, Sheffer added.
A photographer at the scene saw two damaged cars, one which had flipped over. Israeli media reported Ben Gvir had been travelling in this vehicle.
Police said the traffic department was investigating an  “accident in Ramla involving two vehicles, including the vehicle of the Minister of National Security”. 
Ben Gvir had been holding a press conference at the scene of the stabbing, saying a civilian had killed the attacker and claiming that “weapons save lives”.
“I was moved when I found out that the civilian got his gun four months ago as part of the gun reform that I advanced,” Ben Gvir had said.
A photographer at the scene of the stabbing saw a body bag and a large number of police officers.
Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency medical service said it was alerted to the stabbing in Harduf Street at around 4:20 pm (1320 GMT).

12,Columbia varsity faces complaint after arresting protesters,"Palestine Legal urges Education Department to probe school’s actions, alleging they are discriminatory against those who are pro-Palestinian.","WASHINGTON: A pro-Palestinian US group filed a federal civil rights complaint against Columbia University following last week’s mass arrest of anti-war protesters after the school called police to clear demonstrator encampments, the group said on Thursday.
Palestine Legal, an organisation that seeks to protect the rights of people in the US to speak out on behalf of Palestinians, urged the Education Department to probe the school’s actions, which it alleges were discriminatory against those who are pro-Palestinian.
Columbia University declined to comment.
Last week, the university tried to shut down campus demonstrations by force when Columbia President Minouche Shafik took the unusual move of inviting New York City police to enter the campus, drawing the ire of many human rights groups, students and faculty. More than 100 people were arrested, reminiscent of the demonstrations against the Vietnam war at Columbia more than 50 years ago.
Protests have since continued at Columbia and spread to other US campuses where hundreds have been arrested in the last week.
The Gaza crisis has caused intense discourse across the United States, Israel’s most important ally.
Advocacy groups note a rise in hate and bias against Jews, Arabs and Palestinians.
Alarming US incidents include the fatal October stabbing of a six-year-old Palestinian American in Illinois, the November shooting of three students of Palestinian descent in Vermont and the February stabbing of a Palestinian American man in Texas.
Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said on Thursday he was following reports of allegations of antisemitism on college campuses. Earlier this month, a former Cornell University student pleaded guilty to posting online threats, including of death and violence, against Jewish students on campus.
