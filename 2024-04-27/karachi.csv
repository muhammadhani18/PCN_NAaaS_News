• Says recovery of previous amounts to remain suspended till final decision in the case              
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court was told on Thursday that the Sindh government intended to bring a legislation to end a controversy whether the provincial government or the cantonment boards in Karachi will assess and collect the urban property tax from residents of cantonment areas.
A five-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah ordered the Sindh government to legislate the law within a period of three months. 
It said until the new law is devised, the earlier interim relief granted by the court in March 18 will continue. 
According to the interim relief, the cantonment boards will charge urban immovable property tax at the rates prescribed under the Sindh Urban Immovable Property Tax Act 1958, but the recovery of previous amounts will remain suspended until final decision of the case. 
Barrister Zeeshan Adhi represented the Sindh government.
The apex court also expressed the hope that after the enactment of the legislation, the issue would be resolved forever. However, it said, the Sindh government or any party in case of being aggrieved of the law may again approach the court.
The SC has taken a set of appeals moved by the federal government through the ministry of defence as well as cantonment boards in Karachi against the Jan 6 judgement of the Sindh High Court (SHC) in which it was held that after the amendment in Entry 50 in the Fourth Schedule of the Federal Legislative List (FLL) under the 18th Amendment, the federal government and cantonment boards lacked competence, power, and jurisdiction to levy, charge, impose and recover taxes on any immovable property including tax on the annual rental value of immovable property.
The high court’s judgement had also noted that the 18th Amendment had restored the competence and jurisdiction of the province to levy, charge, recover and legislate on the subject identified and to pursue it accordingly.
At the last hearing on March 18, the Supreme Court had asked the Sindh government why it had failed to resolve the controversy when the option to bring legislation of enacting the law was available to the provincial government under Article 270A(3) of the Constitution and why the matter was being debated at the courts.
In return, the Sindh government’s counsel had offered no plausible answer and sought time to obtain instructions from authorities in this regard.
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan had also contended that the Sindh Urban Immovable Property Tax Act 1958 was a provincial legislation and the urban rating area includes the cantonments. Subsequently the Presidential Order of 1979: the Cantonments (Urban Immovable Property Tax and Entertainments Duty) Order 1979 was promulgated on Aug 22, 1979 and subsequently protected under 18th Amendment in terms of Article 270A(6) of the Constitution. After the 18th Amendment, the Order 1979 was once again protected under Article 270A(3) of the Constitution.
Thus the only difference between the two laws is that under Order 1979, it was the cantonments that carry out assessment and collection as opposed to the Sindh government, the AGP had stated, adding Order 1979 falls within the federal domain.
The AGP had also contended that due to the SHC judgement, the cantonments had stopped collecting taxes and without funds such boards could not function, thus unable to provide services to the people in the Cantonment areas.
On Thursday, the Sindh government told the Supreme Court that they intended to bring legislation in this regard.
The appeals by the federal and cantonment boards argued that the high court judgement had not appreciated the fact that it was inherent in the nature of a local government to raise taxes, fee, cess for the purposes of local governance and provisions of municipality amenities, services which was a global phenomenon.
The petition contended that the cantonment boards were local authorities and fall within the meaning of the State in terms of Article 7 of the Constitution and as such the boards were by law empowered to impose any tax, fee or cess in its jurisdiction.
The cantonment boards has been discharging their functions and duties and collecting taxes, fee, taxes on the value of the buildings within their territorial limits.
Some residents of cantonments in Karachi had challenged the property tax before the SHC and stated that such taxes could not be imposed and collected by the cantonments.

2,"PTI public meeting can’t be allowed for four weeks due to ‘imminent threat’, SHC told",Bench asks authorities to give a reasonable justification for denial of permission,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court was informed on Friday that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s appliction seeking permission to hold a public meeting near the Mazar-i-Quaid could not be entertained for at least four weeks due to an imminent threat.em
The district administration contended that as per police, there was an imminent threat posed to the life and property of the public and, therefore, permission could not be accorded at least for four weeks or till the threat was neutralised.
At the last hearing, the SHC had directed the officials concerned to furnish a compliance report on the subject matter by April 19, if there was no legal impediment.
When a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi took up the matter for hearing on Friday, deputy commissioner (East) Shahzad Abbasi along with Additional Advocate General (AAG) Saifullah turned up and filed a report/statement along with annexures.

Bench asks authorities to give a reasonable justification for denial of permission

The AAG submitted that there was a threat to the public and recently, an incident of terrorism had also taken place in a Malir locality.
The chief justice inquired as to when such a threat would be neutralised and the administration would be able to grant permission for the gathering. The AAG said that as per district administration, it may take a month.
Responding to another query of the chief justice about any other political gathering, the lawyer for petitioner, Ali Tahir, argued that the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League had held a public meeting at Shahrah-i-Quaideen a couple of days ago. However, the DC submitted that no such permission was granted for the gathering.
At this, the chief justice asked the officials as to what action had been taken against the persons concerned for holding the public meeting without permission. However, the DC and other officials could not offer any suitable reply.
The chief justice further said that the court would not be convinced until a reasonable justification was offered for denying permission for public meeting.
While addressing the petitioner and his lawyer, he also remarked that if any untoward incident happened during the gathering, the administration would hold them accountable.
The bench adjourned the hearing till May 6, after the lawyer for petitioner sought a short adjournment to examine the report of district administration.
The DC in his statement also attached the reports of SSP (East), SHO Brigade and assistant commissioner concerned.
The police officials in their reports stated that security vetting and ground checks were conducted and it had transpired that in the wake of recent developments nationally and geopolitically, the hostile elements were engaging more actively in the terrorist and sabotage activities in the country.
“That numerous threat alerts are received from sister agencies, especially regarding Karachi, in which hostile elements are planning to carrying out terrorist and sabotage actives, which may result in loss of lives of the innocent citizens”, the reports said.
PTI-Sindh general secretary Ali Ahmed Palh petitioned the SHC and submitted that the party had approached the district and provincial administration on a number of occasions for permission or no-objection certificate to hold a public gathering, but to no avail.

4,Commissioner highlights issues of governance in Karachi,"KARACHI: At a talk organised by the English Speaking Union Pakistan (ESUP) at a local hotel here on Friday,...","KARACHI: At a talk organised by the English Speaking Union Pakistan (ESUP) at a local hotel here on Friday, Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi discussed a number of challenges in governing Karachi.
The commissioner touched upon and explained the issues faced by the city such as uncontrolled population growth, jurisdictional quagmire, the ever changing local government system, inadequate master planning, poor water supply and sanitation, inefficient transport system, dilapidated heritage, degrading environment and cumbersome price and quality control.
In the last 70 years, the population of Karachi increased from 1,1 million to 20m, he said, adding that the biggest growth rate was in district Central and district East, which also saw the influx of people from upcountry. Therefore, the growth was rapid, which impacted livability.
“The acute challenges facing Karachi, compounded by rapid population growth and complex governance structures have over the past few decades resulted in the degradation of its dense urban and social environment, making it one of the least livable cities globally,” he said.
The fragmented governance also came in the way of urban planning and service delivery in Karachi and there had been seven master plans proposed for the city in the past, including two before independence in 1947, but despite efforts, the implementation of those plans had proven challenging, he said. 
“The first plan, proposed by A.E. Miran in 1922 was the only one fully approved and implemented. The second plan, proposed by Colonel Swain Thomas in 1946, and the subsequent five plans faced issues such as delayed publication, mismatched proposals with the current reality, legal and technical shortcomings and limited implementation,” the commissioner pointed out.
He said another big issue faced by the city was its water supply as water was being supplied to Karachi from considerably distant locations through a bulk conveyance system consisting of a complex network of canals, conduits, siphons, multi-stage pumping and filtration. 
The present supply to Karachi from Indus and Hub was approximately 650MGD. The gallons per capita water demand for a population of 20 million was 1,080MGD, bringing the current shortfall to 430MGD.
“By 2025, the projected population of Karachi will be 23 million, bringing up the demand to 1,242MGD and a shortfall of 600MGD,” he said and added that the city also suffered from a poor drainage 
system along with the issue of solid waste management.
According to him, the main issues of the transport sector in Karachi include inadequate road network, overcrowding and congestion, a predominantly radial road network with limited circumferential connectivity and an absence of mass transit and adequate public transport.
He said Karachi was also one of the most vulnerable cities of Pakistan, prone to different kinds of threats and hazards due to its unique geo-climatic conditions. It was at a high risk of disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, water scarcity, heat waves and fire, he added.
“Due to a high incidence of air, land and water pollution that results from inadequate management of solid and hazardous waste including municipal waste, medical waste, raw sewerage, industrial affluent and vehicular pollution, a large population of Karachi is prone to diseases linked to environmental pollution,” he pointed out.
As for the price and quality control challenges, he said that the precarious economic situation led to continuous price fluctuations. “Additionally, groceries, milk and meat prices are subject to frequent fluctuations due to factors such as seasonal variations. Hence, formulating effective policies may become challenging,” he said.
He added that the supply chain for essential commodities in Karachi was also complex and fragmented, involving numerous intermediaries, wholesalers and retailers. “This complexity makes it difficult to track price fluctuations and identify instances of price gouging or hoarding,” he said.
President International Council of ESU and Patron-in-Chief ESUP Aziz Memon, its President Pervez H. Madraswala and Secretary General Majyd Aziz also spoke.

5,G.M. Syed’s 29th death anniversary observed peacefully,DADU: Several nightlong gatherings of Sindhi nationalist leaders and activists were held in Sann town to pay homage...,"DADU: Several nightlong gatherings of Sindhi nationalist leaders and activists were held in Sann town to pay homage to veteran politician G.M. Syed on his 29th death anniversary observed on Thursday. 
Although large groups of men, women and children had started arriving Sann since Wednesday morning from across Sindh to attend the anniversary events, they proceeded to the venue of their choice as the Sindh United Party, Jeay Sindh Movement, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz, Jeay Sindh Mahaz, (proscribed) Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz and each of their breakaway factions had organised separate programmes close to the grave of the veteran leader. 
All those destined for Sann had to pass through security check posts set up all along the routes leading to the town. Unlike in the past, there were no reports of any traveller having been detained by the police, Rangers or some other security agency. Nor was there any such claim made by the nationalist entities. 
The event passed off by and large peacefully. 
Syed’s followers used to be detained and even arrested in crackdowns allegedly for raising anti-state and anti-army slogans at gatherings held in the past to observe his birth or death anniversary anywhere in the province. However, this time the participants, perhaps, refrained from raising such slogans. 
The main anniversary programme was held at the Syeds’ residence which was hosted by Sindh United Party (SUP) Chairman Syed Jalal Mahmood Shah, the grandson of G.M. Syed. 
The entire SUP leadership and a large number of party workers and supporters led by its President, Syed Zain Shah, attended the programme, which started on Thursday evening and continued into Friday morning.
The participants took out a torch-bearing ally from G.M. Syed’s residence to his grave. They laid floral wreaths and showered rose petals on the grave and paid their respect to the late leader. 
The SUP leaders spoke to the participants at a remembrance held at Syeds’ residence.  
Syed Zain Shah paid homage to the late leader saying that his nationalist philosophy is aimed at creating harmony between each two nations living in the country. He recalled that G.M. Syed had endorsed the 1940 Resolution and played a key role in the creation of Pakistan. “G.M. Syed is the name of political ethics, character, courage and steadfastness,” he remarked, and said he propagated peace, love and brotherhood through his philosophy and active politics. He was a true lover of Sindh and Sindhis and always worked for making Pakistan stronger, Shah said. 
Unfortunately, he added, G.M. Syed was incarcerated and kept in detention for a big part of his life over his nationalist views, politics and activism which were not liked by the establishment. 
He paid rich tributes to G.M. Syed for his life-long struggle for the rights of Sindh and Sindhi nation. 
Zain Shah said followers and supporters of Syed would carry forward his mission with great vigour and continue their struggle till Sindh and Sindhis were given all their due constitutional rights.
He claimed that Sindh’s rights and resources had been usurped in the past and were still being snatched. Even the very existence of Sindh was under threat today, he said, and vowed to intensify the struggle to protect its territory and all its interests.
He said that all nations in Pakistan should be regarded equal and they should have ownership and authority on their respective resources.
The SUP president also criticised the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party for keeping feudal lords within its ranks “and patronising criminal activities, like kidnapping for ransom and dacoities, through them”. He alleged that PPP lawmakers and police had a nexus with the criminal gangs due to which law and order situation in Sindh had constantly been deteriorating. 
‘Sufi Melo’ was one of the main features of SUP’s programme where poets recited mystic verses and vocalists gave musical performance. 
The other programmes held in Sann to observe G.M. Syed’s death anniversary were organised by JSQM led by its Chairman Sanan Qureshi, JSQM-Arisar led by Aslam Khairpuri, JSM-R led by Riaz Chandio and proscribed JSMM led by Shafi Burfat.

Villagers said that a group of armed men believed to be Marfanis, rivals of Bhayos, opened indiscriminate fire at the family and fled away firing in the air.
Later, a large number of family members, relatives and supporters of the victims brought the bodies of Naveed Ahmed Bhayo, 22, his wife Ghulam Fatima, 20, and his sister-in-law Nana Khatoon, 22, to the Indus Highway in Hamayun village and blocked the highway with burning tyres and wood in protest against the triple murder.
The enraged protesters, who also staged a sit-in, alleged that the attackers belonged to Marfani clan and that Faraz Imtiaz Shaikh, a son of Pakistan Peoples Party leader Imtiaz Shaikh was involved in the attack.
Sources said that later the demonstrators removed the bodies to Shikarpur Civil Hospital for post mortem. When they were handed back the bodies they stopped ambulances and once again placed the bodies at Zero-point in the city to block the Sukkur-Shikarpur road, they said.
The protesters raised slogans against the area’s police and demanded immediate action against Marfani assailants.
Former provincial minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh rejected, in a media talk, the protesters’ allegations implicating his son in the attack. Everyone knew the incident was an offshoot of an old feud between the rival groups of Bhayo and Marfani clans, who had been at daggers drawn with each other for a long time, he said, adding his family had nothing to do with their dispute or the incident.
Shikarpur SPP told this correspondent on mobile phone that police believed the incident was in continuation of a simmering feud between rival groups of Bhayo and Marfani clans. Police teams had cordoned off the area and managed to control the situation to avert further bloodshed, he said.
He said that police had mounted search for the assailants and would arrest them soon. The dispute had so far claimed 10 lives and caused injuries to several persons on both sides, he said.

7,"Kandhkot rises against raging tribal feuds, bandit rule","SUKKUR: Activists of nationalist parties, members of social organisations, students and members of general public...","SUKKUR: Activists of nationalist parties, members of social organisations, students and members of general public took to the streets on Friday on a call for protest given by a local alliance, All Parties Movement, against rising crime rate, raging tribal feuds and continuing bandit rule in Kandhkot district on Friday.
The protesters began their march from deputy commissioner’s office and made a brief stopover at Ghanta Ghar before culminating at press club where they raised charged slogans against district police for their failure to protect people, maintain writ of the state and restore peace across the Kandhkot-Kashmore district.
They were carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans of “provide peace”, “peace should prevail on the land of peace”, “stop hooliganism and terrorism”, “stop massacre of innocent people in the guise of tribal disputes”.
Hafiz Nasrullah Channa, Zareef Bijarani, Chaudhary Dewan Lal, Sufi Dr Suresh Kumar and others said that peace and order had completely crumbled in Kandhkot and police had utterly failed to provide security to citizens.
They said that the ongoing police operation was just a farce as police had neither killed any dacoit nor rescued any hostage in their so-called operation. Dacoits and outlaws had become more powerful than police because the district police themselves had become accomplice with bandits, they said.
They said that crimes of killing, robberies, looting, snatching and abduction for ransom had become a routine in the district, which had inflicted huge economic losses on the district. They believed the unsettled tribal feuds and armed clashes among clans had promoted purchase of sophisticated weapons and ammunition. The tribal feuds raged on as police had failed to control the assailants and killers of innocent people, they said.
They said that residents of the district, particularly Hindu families, had started migrating from the district due to growing crime rate and unbridled lawlessness and tribal feuds across the district.
The protesters demanded that Chief of Army Staff, Chief Justice of Pakistan and other higher authorities should take notice of unrest in Kandhkot-Kashmore district and restore peace in the district.

They complained to media persons that they had been plying their buses and coasters on the Mirpurkhas-Naukot route since 1990 without having to pay any protection money to anyone but these gangsters had appeared for last few months and they were forcing them at gunpoint to pay them Rs2,000 per vehicle daily otherwise their coasters would not be allowed to ply on the route.
They said that they complained to police but they were not taking action any against the gangsters, forcing them to observe protest.

12,PPP asks Muttahida to support police in fight against street crime in Karachi,Says policemen suspected of having links with dacoit gangs.,"• Rate of incidents of crime in Karachi ‘declining’, claims IGP
• Says policemen suspected of having links with dacoit gangs brought to Karachi for inquiry
• Muttahida urges Lanjar to consider ‘local’ officers in appointment of SHOs
KARACHI: In a rare show of unity, lawmakers belonging to the opposition Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and ruling Pakistan Peoples Party put aside their differences and sat together with top police authorities to find a solution to the menace of street crime in the metropolis.
An 11-member delegation of the MQM-P, led by Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Ali Khurshidi called on Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar at the Central Police Office, where Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon gave a comprehensive briefing on street crime.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, ministers Jam Khan Shoro and Dost Ali Rahimoon of the PPP were also present. The two sides discussed ‘growing’ street crimes in the city and sought an effective policing system to curb the menace.
During the meeting, the home minister sought cooperation from the MQM-P , asking the delegation to come forward and support the police in their efforts to protect life and property of the people.
Opposition leader Khurshidi said that the MQM-P wanted a political and administrative solution of the problem of street crime.
Talking to the media after the meeting, Mr Khurshidi said that killing of youths during street crimes was not a ‘political’ but ‘humanitarian issue’.
“We do not want partisan politics over this issue, but we want a political and administrative solution to this menace, therefore we came for the meeting,” he said, adding that no party should give an ‘ethnic’ colour to the issue of street crime.
“We will not let the citizens suffer because of negligence of the police or the government,” he added.
The opposition leader warned that if street crime were not controlled, they would be compelled to stage a “political protest”.
Responding to a question, Mr Khurshidi said that the delegation asked the home minister to give preference to ‘local officers’ in appointing SHOs in Karachi.
He said the home minister was also asked to introduce ‘community policing’ in the metropolis.
IGP admits surge in cars, motorbike snatching
During the briefing, the IGP admitted that there was a surge in snatching of cars and motorcycles in Karachi, but brushed aside the impression about any rise in snatching of cell phones and theft of four-wheelers and two-wheelers, calming that due to ‘efforts’ of the law-enforcement agency the rate of street crimes in the metropolis was not growing, but rather ‘declining’.
The IGP said that till April 24, a total of 48 people were shot dead in street crimes whose 46 cases were registered.
He said 12 other murder cases had been included which did not belong to street crimes.
He said out of 46 cases, 27 cases had been ‘traced or solved’ while 13 suspected street criminals were shot dead in ‘encounters’ while 33 others, including 27 in injured condition, were arrested.
He said of the 12 other murder cases that a section of media had reported as robbery related killings, eight of them had been ‘traced’ and it transpired that they were the outcome of other crimes, not robbery.
256 street crimes per day reported in 2023
Giving comparative data, the IG said in the last year of 2023, 256 street crimes (which included snatching of cars, bikes, cell phones and theft of four-wheelers and two-wheelers) per day were reported but in current year of 2024 till April 24, the said five heads of the street crimes were continuously declining.
He pointed out that in January 2024, 252 street crimes per day were reported, 251 in Feb, 243 in March and so far till April 24, a total of 174 street crimes reported per day as per data of the Citizens Police Liaison Committee and the police.
The IGP admitted that snatching of cars and motorcycles were on the rise, but snatching of cell phones and theft of four-wheelers and two-wheelers were on decline.
He pointed out that last year from January to April 24, 2023, a total of 8,912 cell phones were snatched, but during the same corresponding period this year, 6,940 mobile phones were snatched, thus there was a reduction of 1,972 cell phones.
“By making comparative analysis of street crimes, I don’t want to show that we’re ‘satisfied’ with the crimes but we feel sorry over the loss of innocent lives and want to tell the people that the police are making concerted efforts to eliminate this menace,” observed the IG.
‘Cops with ties to riverine dacoits not given posting in Karachi’
The IGP said that the MQM-P lawmakers had raised the issue of policemen suspected of having links with dacoit gangs in riverine area.
He said he informed them that none of them had been given posting in Karachi. They were transferred to the police headquarters in Karachi to face inquiries over their alleged criminal activities.
“These policemen have the right to defend themselves,” said the IG. Different officers have been appointed for inquiries against them. If the transferred policemen are found involved in criminal activities, they will be ‘challaned’ (formerly charge-sheeted).
He said none of the policemen transferred from Shikarpur had been given posting in Karachi.

14,"PTI stages rallies across Sindh to demand release of Imran Khan, other workers",Haleem Adil claims party founder to be freed soon,"KARACHI: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Friday staged rallies, walks and protest demonstrations across the province, demanding release of its imprisoned founding chairman Imran Khan and “justice” for dozens of workers who were behind bars in connection with the May 9 riot cases.
In Karachi, a large number of activists and supporters of the party took to the streets in almost all city districts and staged rallies, sit-ins and demonstrations in line with their party’s call of holding countrywide protests. 
They also asked the judiciary to take notice of the “highhandedness” of the authorities for denying the party its constitutional right of peaceful protests whenever it announced to take to the streets.
While many protests were held in different parts of the city, two major events were held in district East and district South.

Haleem Adil claims party founder to be freed soon

In district East, a rally was taken out from Millennium Mall to Bahadurabad via Rashid Minhas Road and University Road. 
Charged participants, including women and children, used different modes of transport to take part in the rally. They were carrying placards, PTI flags, portraits of Imran Khan and chanting slogans for his release.
Addressing the participants at Chaar Minar Chowrangi in Bahadurabad, PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh vowed that the struggle of the PTI workers was set to bear fruit and their “beloved leader” would soon be among them.
“Imran Khan’s days in prison are going to be over and he would be soon among you,” he said. “This fake government can no more stand against the people’s will.”
He said that the entire country was paying the price for what happened on February 8 in the name of elections. “Those who were celebrating their fake victories are now not able to face the public. Even the formation of the governments in the Centre and provinces has become joke for everyone.”
He said that on Feb 8, the people of Karachi voted for PTI and there was no other party on ground in the contest. But it’s an ironic that those who were rejected by the people of Karachi were imposed again only for the vested interests of certain quarters.
In district South, a large number of women activists of the PTI assembled outside the Karachi Press Club to hold a protest.
In Hyderabad, activists of PTI staged a protest demonstration outside the local press club for release of Imran Khan and against rigging in by elections. 
The protesters raised slogans against the government and demanded withdrawal of cases against Imran Khan and his spouse. 
They said that the government was working like “a slave of the US” and accused it of victimising PTI workers and leaders.
In Nawabshah, party workers gathered at Shiraz Chowk to stage a rally.
In Sanghar, PTI activists also held a protest demonstration against the prolonged incarceration of their founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. 
The Umerkot chapter of the party also took out a rally and demanded that Mr Khan be released forthwith.
