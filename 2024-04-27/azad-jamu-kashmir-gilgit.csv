0,"Hepatitis outbreak prompts crackdown, testing drive",LHEAP survey reveals one in every five residents affected by deadly disease in Fauji Colony,"Following an alarming rise in hepatitis cases in Rawalpindi's Fauji Colony area, extensive awareness and testing initiatives have been launched to shield residents from the growing health threat.
The Local Hepatitis Elimination and Prevention Program (LHEAP) has spearheaded this campaign, introducing testing and vaccination services to diagnose and combat hepatitis effectively.
One of the key focal points has been addressing hygiene lapses in establishments like barber shops, dental clinics, and tyre shops along Bokra Road, a bustling business hub adjoining the affected union council. The officials from the LHEAP programme have taken swift action, sealing off eleven barber shops, a dental clinic, and a tyre shop in response to their use of non-sterilised tools.
This crackdown is part of a broader effort to enforce cleanliness protocols and mitigate the spread of hepatitis within the community.
The prevalence of hepatitis in Fauji Colony has been alarming, with roughly one in every five or six residents affected by the disease, according to LHEAP's assessments.
Poor hygiene practices among residents and the negligence of cleanliness standards in local establishments have exacerbated the situation.
A pivotal aspect of the campaign has been community engagement, exemplified by the formation of a support group under the LHEAP programme. One such gathering drew fifty women, who were educated about preventive measures against hepatitis B and C, along with guidance on treatment options for those afflicted. Complimentary services, including free hepatitis testing and vaccinations, were provided post-discussion, emphasising the programme's holistic approach to combatting hepatitis.
LHEAP CEO Dr Ansar Ishaq highlighted the programme's strategic focus on Fauji Colony in Union Council 8, chosen based on surveys indicating a spike in hepatitis cases in the area. Factors like inadequate access to clean water and poor hygiene practices among the densely populated populace have been identified as major contributors to the escalating infections. The programme's initiatives include ongoing awareness campaigns, free testing, and treatment for hepatitis C patients, all made possible through collaborative efforts with self-help groups and philanthropic support.

2,Rawalpindi grapples with waste management crisis,City’s waste woes exasperate as exiting dumping site reaches capacity,"Tonnes of daily waste in Rawalpindi is becoming a headache for the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC) as a 585-kanal dumping site in Losar is running out of capacity and a new site comprising 1,251 kanals has not yet been established in the Sahang area of Gujar Khan.
However, the authorities expanded the scope of RWMC, which is responsible for the transfer of solid waste from Rawalpindi to the outside of the city, to the level of the division.
Sources told The Express Tribune that 1,251 kanals of the new dumping site could not be transferred to the RWMC as the Board of Revenue failed to transfer Rs80 million to the land owners. There was no progress beyond the presentation of the waste-to-energy project at the dumping site.
According to the details, the RWMC took over the task of transferring solid waste from the city after the seven-year contract worth Rs8 billion with the Turkish firm for the daily transfer of solid waste from the city of Rawalpindi concluded. 46 union councils of Rawalpindi city, including a few roller union councils, metro bus service stations and Murree have also been included in the ambit of the company. However, the Punjab government has decided to expand the sanitation system to the district level in big cities and to once again outsource the transfer of solid waste to the dumping site. An agreement has also been struck at the division level in this regard.
The Losar waste dumping site established in 2007 adjacent to GT Road is not only nearing the end of its capacity but is also causing worse air pollution and contamination of underground water, risking the lives of residents of adjacent residential settlements.
On the other hand, the Punjab government has already transferred Rs80m to the RWMC for acquiring land for the Sahanag dumping site. The BoR has yet to take possession of 1,251 kanals of land despite receiving Rs80 million from the company.
RWMC Chief Executive Officer Rana Sajid Safdar says that like the other 20 districts of Punjab, the scope of the sanitation system under the company in Rawalpindi district has been extended to the division and an agreement with the company has already been struck. “After the services and asset management agreement at the divisional level, as per the decision of the Punjab government, the process of outsourcing the sanitation system will be kicked off at the divisional level. For which it has been decided to invite open tender from expert companies,” he added.
Dr Hamid Iqbal, who is the senior manager of operations at the RWMC, says that the project of generating gas and electricity under waste-to-energy at the new dumping site of solid waste and disposing of waste without spreading pollution is one of the most expensive projects, however, if the project is approved, a regular research-based project could be started for the project having far-reaching effects.

To bolster fire resistance, large water ponds have been created in primary dense forest areas, ensuring quick access to water for firefighting vehicles and reducing the need for long-distance water sourcing. The fire season may extend to July 31 if exceptionally dry and hot conditions persist beyond July 15.

8,Kaghan road reopening kindles tourism hopes,NHA has commenced efforts to reopen the route,"After six months of closure due to heavy snowfall, landslides, and glacier collapse, the crucial Kaghan highway leading to the renowned tourist destination of Naran is finally undergoing restoration.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) has commenced efforts to reopen the route following the conclusion of the snow season.
Anticipated to be accessible by the first week of May, the restored road promises to not only reconnect tourists with the picturesque valley but also provide employment opportunities for thousands.
The closure of the Kaghan highway, stretching from Rajwal to Naran, occurred after a significant glacier incident obstructed the route.
With up to eight feet of snowfall in recent years, the valley faced accessibility challenges, impacting millions of annual tourists. However, with ongoing restoration efforts, officials assure that the glacier hindering the route will be cleared in the coming days.
Beyond serving as a lifeline for connecting Kaghan Valley with the centre, the Kaghan Highway also offers a safer and more convenient travel option for Gilgit-Baltistan travellers compared to the Karakoram Highway, reducing travel time by five hours.
Local business communities, especially those in the tourism sector, eagerly await the highway’s reopening, anticipating a resurgence in business activities and the revival of tourism hotspots like Lake Saiful Malook, Lake Lulusar, and Lalazar.
As the restoration progresses, hopes are high that the scenic beauty and economic vitality of the region will once again flourish, drawing in visitors and revitalising the local economy.
