• Hopes former prime minister’s leadership will inject new impetus into party
LAHORE: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif is all set to reassume the party presidency, taking over from his younger brother Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, six years after the Supreme Court disqualified Mr Nawaz from holding the post.
The announcement emerged from a PML-N Punjab chapter meeting on Friday, where a resolution was passed urging Mr Nawaz to lead the party since he has been acquitted in all pending corruption cases.
“Nawaz Sharif was disqualified in 2017 (by the Supreme Court) through a conspiracy. Now it’s time that he assumes the office of the party president and lead the party to new heights of popularity,” the resolution said.
PML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah told a presser after the meeting that Mr Nawaz was being made president of the party again primarily to “undo the injustice” the Supreme Court meted out to him in 2017 in Panama Papers-related corruption cases.
Mr Sanaullah said the party would “request” Mr Nawaz to accept the party’s president’s office upon his return from China. Nawaz Sharif left for China on a five-day private visit on the day the Iranian president arrived in Islamabad early this week.
“Nawaz Sharif was removed from the party president’s office through a conspiracy. Now that Nawaz Sharif has been acquitted in all (corruption) cases, he should take up the party’s reins,” Mr Sanaullah said.
Asked whether Mr Nawaz was being made the PML-N president again to have a complete hold of the party affairs, Mr Sanaullah said this was not the case, as all the decisions made by the current party president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, were already endorsed by the elder Sharif.
Mr Sanaullah said Mr Nawaz would inject new impetus into the party and reorganise it under his leadership.
The former interior minister also did not rule out new appointments to other party offices after Nawaz Sharif’s return.
It has been learnt that Khawaja Saad Rafique, who lost his National Assembly seats in Lahore, is lobbying with the Sharifs for the party’s secretary general seat.
Mr Sanaullah also tried to give the impression that there had been no grouping in the party. Referring to PML-N leader Javed Latif, he said, “Those sitting beside me show that there is a freedom of expression in the party”.
Mr Latif, who lost his NA seat from his hometown of Sheikhupura, has made different claims regarding the PML-N’s lower-than-expected performance in the February general elections and the establishment’s role.
Similarly, Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique also made some controversial statements regarding Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government. Since the trio is considered from the Nawaz camp, their statements were taken as expressions of the elder Sharif’s sentiments.
To a question, Mr Sanaullah said that if courts gave bail to PTI founder Imran Khan, he could come out of jail. Earlier, Mr Sanaullah said Nawaz Sharif was willing to talk to Mr Khan for the country’s sake.
Following his arrival in Lahore in October last year after a four-year self-imposed exile in London, Nawaz Sharif got a clean chit in Panama Papers-related corruption cases.
He was all set to become prime minister for a fourth time, but his party failed to get a simple majority in the Feb 8 polls. Mr Nawaz then allowed Shehbaz Sharif, considered close to the military establishment, to lead a six-party coalition government in the Centre.
Recently, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui dismissed the impression that Mr Nawaz’s path to premiership was blocked by an “unseen power” or his younger brother, Mr Shehbaz.
“During my meetings with the three-time prime minister before the 2024 general elections, I felt that Nawaz Sharif was not eager to assume the PM Office for the fourth time,” he said while talking at a Geo News programme. He also dismissed the impression that Mr Nawaz was impatient and restless in becoming the premier again and described it as media speculation.
However, Mr Sanaullah disagreed with Mr Siddiqui’s assertion, insisting that the PML-N’s candidate for the premier’s slot was Nawaz Sharif. “Since the party failed to get a simple majority, it decided to make Shehbaz the premier,” he said.

1,Validity of Afghan POR cards extended till June 30,"• PM orders probe into failure of track and trace system in tobacco, cement, sugar and fertiliser sectors • Several firms inter","• PM orders probe into failure of track and trace system in tobacco, cement, sugar and fertiliser sectors     • Several firms interested in PIA, cabinet told
• Special court in Makran approved to deal with anti-narcotics cases
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Friday approved the extension of validity of Proof of Regis­tration (POR) cards of Afghan refugees from April 1 to June 30 this year.  
A meeting of the cabinet, presided by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was told that with this exte­nsion, recommended by the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions, POR cardholders will be able to avail education, bank acco­unts and other facilities in Pakistan.  
POR cardholders will be repatriated in the third phase of the programme of repatriating illegal foreign nationals. Meanwhile, the meeting was told that the first phase of repatriating the foreign residents living in Pakistan without any identity documents is in progress.  
The PM said elements involved in the deep-rooted menace of corruption and criminal negligence for denting the national economy would be held accountable.  
Referring to the track and trace system agreement made in 2019, the prime minister said this system was nothing but a cruel joke to the nation as no improvement was seen in the sectors of tobacco, cement, sugar and fertiliser.  
The agreement (signed between the government and these industries to monitor production and sales) is totally a fraud as it does not even include a penalty clause in it, he added.  
The PM ordered formation of an inquiry committee to ascertain the failure of the agreement and submission of its report within 72 hours.  
As regards the macroeconomic indicators, the prime minister expressed satisfaction over the collective performance of both the incumbent and interim governments. “According to a recently published report on Pakistan economy, many indicators, including IT export, remittances and capital market, are showing positive results due to the prudent policies of the government,” he added.  
“However, a lot of work needs to be done,” he said, adding that the government will perform “major surgical operation” to get rid of deep-rooted flaws in the country’s economy. 
Power theft, FBR reforms 
PM Shehbaz told the meeting that he had completed the power sector review in four phases in which important decisions were taken to minimise power theft and line losses, and to reduce prices of electricity. “The government also decided in principle to divest the electricity distribution companies (Discos),” he added.  
The PM said the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had old and obsolete systems which needed to be replaced to increase tax-to-GDP ratio. He said the FBR had the potential to earn extra revenues worth hundreds of billions of rupees by implementing reforms in its system. “We have to take tough decision in larger interest of the country and we will fully monitor the implementation phase,” he remarked. 
PIA privatisation 
About the privatisation of state-owned entities (SOEs), the prime minister assured the meeting that the process would be done without any delay and in a transparent manner.  
The PM was informed that the privatisation process of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was on track and several companies were taking keen interest in the airlines.  
The privatisation secretary, while briefing the cabinet on the recent progress in PIA’s privatisation process, said the advertisements inviting expressions of interest were published in national and international newspapers on April 2, with the last date being May 3, and so far several companies had expressed keen interest in PIA.  
The aviation secretary informed the meeting that service counters at the airports had been increased and further improvement of the facilities was in progress.  
On the recommendation of the Ministry of Law and Justice, the cabinet approved the establishment of an additional special court in Makran division to deal with anti-narcotics cases in Balochistan. The jurisdiction of this court will be extended to Panjgur, Kech, Gwadar, Hub and Lasbela districts.  
The cabinet directed that judges of good repute be appointed in the special court and the prosecution process be made more effective.  
The meeting was told that the consultation with all stakeholders regarding a policy for use of drone technology in the agriculture sector was in final stages and it will soon be presented to the cabinet for approval.  
The cabinet also approved the appointment of four ex-officio members of the Board of the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP). 
Carbon credits 
Meanwhile, chairing the third meeting of Pakistan Council for Climate Change, PM Sharif ordered formation of a committee for consultation with the provinces for policy making on guiding principles for carbon credits.  
“Our challenges regarding climate change are increasing with every passing day,” he said, adding without the consultation with the provinces, there was no question of policy making of any kind on the issue.  
The participants discussed in detail policy guidelines for foreign trading in carbon credits.

2,COAS links sovereignty with financial stability,ISLAMABAD: Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir on Friday emphasised the crucial connection between economic stability...,"ISLAMABAD: Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir on Friday emphasised the crucial connection between economic stability and the country’s sovereignty, and vowed to combat the disruptive effe­cts of social media trolls to prevent distractions from impeding national progress and development.
He was speaking at the Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI) Conference, hosted by the military at the Gen­eral Headquarters. The conference, attended by key civil and military officials including Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal and Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, showcased various agricultural advancements under GPI.
The GPI aims to revolutionise agriculture through the introduction of model farms, water management schemes, technology innovations, and investment partnerships. The initiative, launched in July last year, is aimed at ensuring food security and enhancing agricultural productivity across Pakistan. 
The Fauji Foundation, through its subsidiary Fon­Grow, is leading the corporate farming initiative.
Gen Munir stated, “Complete independence is not possible without economic stability,” underscoring that economic growth is a foundational element for maintaining national sovereignty.
With the aggravation of country’s economic turmoil, the military has significantly broadened its role in economic domain. The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which aims to secure foreign investments and boost economic stability, exemplifies this trend. Moreover, the involvement of the military in facilitating major agreements with countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar shows the expanding economic influence of the military.
The army chief reassured military’s continued support for the economic development of the country, affirming that “Army will continue to provide all possible support for the economic development of Pakistan”. 
Gen Munir used the occasion to highlight the military’s intensifying worries about the social media challenge. “Negative propaganda and social media trolls cannot distract us from working for the development and prosperity of Pakistan and its people,” he maintained In his remarks at the conference, he urged national unity against detractors, saying, “We are all a united team Pakistan… Inshallah with the cooperation and support of the people, all efforts of those who distract and obstruct Pakistan’s development journey will fail.”
The federal ministers, who participated in the conference, praised the “transformative potential” of the GPI. “The initiatives will introduce contemporary best practices in Pakistan’s agriculture sector,” they remarked.

3,"NDMA warns of storms, potential flooding till 29th","Farmers advised to secure harvests, citizens asked to avoid unnecessary travel.","• Farmers advised to secure harvests, citizens asked to avoid unnecessary travel
• Rain, falling prices put wheat crop in Punjab at risk
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a nationwide alert on Friday, cautioning against severe weather conditions expec­ted to persist until April 29. 
The forecast predicts rain, storms, and hail, potentially leading to flash floods and landslides across the country.
“Hailstorms can damage crops and infrastructure. People should avoid unnecessary travel and crossing rivers and canals. Repair mud houses and ensure water drainage,” the NDMA said, urging citizens to stay away from electric poles and trees in case of lightning. It advised farmers to plan their harvest, especially wheat, according to the weather.
The warning comes at a time when crops are ready to be harvested, especially the wheat crop.
Prolonged spells of rain have already delayed wheat harvest in the Potohar region. Farmers in the area have complained about an unprecedented rise in the cost of harvest, saying it has doubled compared to last year due to an increase in fuel prices.
Though the harvest has begun in some parts of the plateau, farmers were worried that the untimely rains would affect the yield. They also fret about the rise in electricity, labour and agricultural machinery costs.
Meanwhile, the Pakis­tan Meteorological Depar­t­ment (PMD) has also flagged the onset of a westerly wave that could exacerbate conditions through April 30. This system is expected to bring widespread rain and thunderstorms, particularly impacting Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat, Murree, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The PMD said the anticipated heavy rainfall and thunderstorms posed risks of road disruptions, particularly affecting travellers and tourists. Authorities have urged individuals to monitor weather updates before embarking on journeys. Disruptions in electricity and other utility services were also anticipated. In addition to the risks posed by heavy rainfall, flash flooding in local streams and river tributaries, as well as landslides and mudslides, were potential hazards in upper KP, Galiyat, Murree, GB and AJK. Farmers have been advised to take extra precautions and adjust agricultural activities accordingly.
The PMD also warned that Balochistan would continue to experience adverse weather conditions, including heavy rainfall, leading to flash flooding in local nullahs and hill torrents in the Sulaiman and the Kirthar mountain ranges.
The new spell of heavy rains with thunderstorms that started in Balochistan on Thursday continued  on Friday, triggering flash floods. 
In the border town of Taftan, a man was swept away in the flash flood while a woman and her daughter were injured in a lightning strike on their house.
The death toll from rain-related incidents in Balochistan reached 19 while around 250 houses were washed away and about 1,850 partially damaged.
Officials said that 14 highways and link roads were badly affected in the flash floods that suspended traffic between Balochistan and other provinces.
Punjab rains
Meanwhile, Punjab, including the city of Lahore, experienced light showers and sporadic hailstorms on Friday afternoon, as predicted by the Met Office.
While it was a mild shower, with the rainfall measuring a maximum of 10mm at one of Lahore’s 16 Water and Sanitation Agency monitoring stations, it has heightened concerns among farmers already facing declining market rates for wheat and potential crop damage.
Meteorological officials said the rain system, originating from India, is expected to intensify, bringing widespread showers to central and northern Punjab on Saturday. “Today, it rained only in Lahore, with Sargodha and Bhakkar areas receiving traces. But in the next 24 hours, all areas of central and northern Punjab may get heavy rains, with thunder, hail and windstorms. In climatic terms, there is nothing to bother. But in an agricultural context, it poses significant risks,” a Met Office employee said.
Farmers, hoping for a slight recovery in wheat prices, had postponed harvesting. However, the recent weather conditions have only exacerbated their plight, soaking and potentially ruining the crops.
“The April weather has always been unpredictable, but with climatic change taking effect, it has turned nasty this year,” said Amanullah, a wheat farmer from Okara.
Persistent strong winds have been damaging the standing crop since the start of the month. This varying degree of damage took place because, in April, the crop’s stems lose contact with soil, and even mild wind can lead to uprooting.
The situation is further complicated by the economic backdrop. Despite a potentially record yield, wheat prices have plummeted, with rates ranging from Rs3,000 to Rs3,200 per maund, representing a loss of Rs700 to Rs900 for farmers.
The delay in harvesting was a strategy to mitigate a market glut and hope for price stabilisation, contingent on an aggressive procurement strategy by the Punjab government — a move that has not materialised.
As Punjab has harvested only about 10 per cent of its wheat so far, the remainder of the crop is vulnerable to ongoing adverse weather conditions.
“It’s a grim scenario for us,” Amanullah lamented. “Caught between a crashing market, an unsympathetic government, and now the fury of Mother Nature, we are bracing for the impact and hoping for the best.”

4,‘US to be told about Pakistan’s critical energy needs’,Foreign Office rejects ‘unwarranted’ Indian claims on AJK,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Friday said it would communicate to the US the critical need for Pakistan to enhance trade and energy cooperation with Iran.
“Pakistan and the United States have a robust dialogue and several channels of communication and we would continue to engage with them and explain the importance that Pakistan accords to its relations with its neighbours and the need for this cooperation so as to have the Pakistan-Iran border as a border of peace, security and prosperity,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at the weekly media briefing.
Pakistan and Iran, during the visit of Iranian President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi earlier this week, committed to increase their annual trade volume to $10bn over the next five years and expand energy cooperation.
Ms Baloch, while referring to the joint communique issued by the countries at the conclusion of Mr Raisi’s visit, said the energy cooperation entails trade in electricity, laying power transmission lines and the IP gas pipeline project. 

Foreign Office rejects ‘unwarranted’ Indian claims on AJK

However, US immediately warned Pakistan against entering into business deals with Iran. “We advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions,” spokesperson Vedant Patel had said during a news briefing.
The IP gas pipeline stands as the most significant component of energy cooperation between Iran and Pakistan. Nevertheless, due to US sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has hesitated to advance the project. This year, Islamabad indicated its readiness to build its portion of the pipeline, primarily to avoid international arbitration by Tehran, which could impose a penalty of $18bn on Pakistan for failing to fulfil the agreement. Despite this development, it remains uncertain if Islamabad will start purchasing gas from Iran as long as US sanctions remain in effect.
Ms Baloch said Pakistan was engaged with US and had discussed the various aspects of Pakistan’s energy needs. She emphasised that Pakistan’s relations with Iran were not at the cost of ties with Washington. “I should underline that Pakistan does not believe in zero-sum relationships. Expan­sion of our relations with one country should not be considered as coming at the expense of our relationship with another. Pakistan is confident that its relationship with its friends and partners, including the United Sta­tes, are robust enough to move forward on their own merit, and notwithstanding any other relationships that Pakistan has with other countries in our national interest,” she said.
Pakistan’s position on the gas project will be shaped by its national interests, focusing on energy needs, and influenced by the global context, including any UN sanctions and trade considerations with other countries, especially within the energy sector, she explained.
Provocation rejected
“We are witnessing an alarming surge in provocative statements from Indian leaders asserting unwarranted claims on AJK. Pakistan rejects these claims. 
“Fuelled by hyper-nationalism, this inflammatory rhetoric poses a grave threat to regional peace and susceptibility,” she added, urging “Indian politicians to cease their reckless practice of dragging Pakistan into India’s populist public discourse for electoral motives”.
“Historical and legal facts as well as ground realities refute India’s baseless claims over AJK. Despite India’s rhetoric and assertions, Jammu and Kashmir remains an internationally recognised disputed territory,” the spokesperson asserted, according to a Dawn.com report.
She noted that the UN Security Council resolutions on the region “clearly outline that the final status of Jammu and Kashmir shall be determined by the will of the people through a free and impartial plebiscite under the UN auspices”.
“India would be wise to help implement these resolutions instead of harbouring delusions of grandeur,” the FO spokesperson stressed.

5,SC clubs petitions on ‘meddling’ by spy agencies,IHC submits proposals before apex court to end interference in judicial affairs; judges unanimous in decision to give an  ‘institutional response’.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has clubbed a set of ten petitions and applications seeking the court’s intervention in response to allegations of “intelligence agencies’ meddling in judicial affairs”, which were highlighted following a March 25 letter by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, the bench includes Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Musarrat Hilali, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. They will resume the case on April 30, initiated on a suo motu. Justice Yahya Afridi has already recused himself from the bench and will no longer participate.
One of the applications concerns impleadment as a party in the hearing, moved by six members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), seeking an inquiry commission to probe the allegations levelled in the high court judge’s letter.
Constitutional petitions by the Lahore High Court Bar Association also requested the appointment of a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court judges. Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan also sought a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court judges, while the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded a probe into the allegations. Similarly, the Balochistan High Court Bar Association and Advocate Shahbaz Ali Khan Khosa also requested an inquiry.

IHC submits proposals before apex court to end interference in judicial affairs; judges unanimous in decision to give an ‘institutional response’

In one of the petitions Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan through his counsel Khwaja Ahmad Hosain had requested the Supreme Court to declare that the allegations by IHC judges, as well as those by Justice (retd) Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, constitute evidence that the premier intelligence agency namely the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and its operatives were involved in unlawful attempts to influence judicial decisions of IHC and the district judiciary in the federal capital, a development which requires judicial probe.
The Supreme Court initiated suo motu proceedings after former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani had recused himself from becoming part of the one-man commission established to probe the allegations of the executive’s interference in judicial affairs.
The decision to proceed under Article 184(3) came a day after a group of lawyers and civil society members wrote a letter addressed to the Supreme Court, in which they said the commission was powerless to probe the claims made by the six judges of the IHC detailing harassment at the hands of intelligence officials.
The petition, moved by Aitzaz Ahsan, pleaded that the Supreme Court should declare any interference in judicial affairs as clearly unlawful and unconstitutional, posing a serious threat to the rule of law and the independence of judiciary.
The petition further urged the Supreme Court to instruct the federal government to terminate the service of all such individuals found involved in such unlawful acts, as determined by the judicial commission, without granting them retirement or other benefits from the national exchequer.
And in case of individuals who have already retired to direct that no retirement or other benefits will be paid to them, the petition contended, adding that the government servants including any serving army officer or ISI operatives, who seek to influence the judicial proceedings or judges will be liable to be terminated forthwith from service without any retirement or other benefits being payable to such individual from the national exchequer.
Likewise, the PBC, through a resolution, had asked for a judicial commission manned by sitting judges of the Supreme Court to address the complaints of meddling by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs.
In the resolution, the PBC requested the Supreme Court to decide the present suo motu case as expeditiously as possible.
The resolution emphasised that judges hold the highest esteem in our nation, carrying significant responsibility for adjudicating cases and meticulously deliberating allegations before reaching verdicts.
Similarly, the IHCBA also sought a probe to hold accountable those responsible for undermining the independence of the judiciary.
IHC submits proposals
In a relevant development, the IHC administration has submitted proposals to end meddling in judicial affairs before the Supreme Court.
The IHC registrar filed the report before the apex court’s registrar’s office.
The report will be submitted before the apex court bench hearing the suo motu case.
In its April 3 order, the Supreme Court called for proposals from the main stakeholders in the judicial system and the independence of the judiciary, namely the PBC, SCBA, high courts, and the federal government.
“They should suggest what should be the institutional response and mechanism to address the issues like the ones raised in the letter [of IHC judges] and ensure that such issues do not arise in future and, if they do, to fix liability and proceed against those responsible,” the order said.
In compliance with the Supreme Court’s direction, the provincial high courts as well as the IHC submitted proposals before the apex court.
The IHC’s proposal was based on the minutes of the full court meeting held on April 23.
In the meeting, the judges unanimously decided to introduce several measures, including the reactivation of ‘empowered’ inspection teams to put an end to the alleged meddling of intelligence officials in judicial affairs.
Sources privy to the meeting told Dawn all the high court judges were unanimous that they would not tolerate interference by any intelligence agency in the proceedings of the high court, district courts, and the special courts.
The IHC proposal explained in details how the inspection team would respond to the complaint received from the judges of subordinate judiciary, said the sources.
The judges also decided to give institutional responses against any attempts to interfere in judicial affairs, and the high court, as an institution, would take up the matter with the top authority of the department involved in meddling.
