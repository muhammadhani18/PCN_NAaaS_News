0,KP CM says he won’t let centre usurp province’s rights,Complains about ‘hurdles’ by centre to appointment of new chief secretary.,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on Friday said that his government won’t allow the centre to usurp the rights of the province.
“The federal government wants to take control of our [KP’s] carbon credits, but we won’t let this happen,” Mr Gandapur told a meeting of the Climate Change Council in Islamabad via video link, according to an official statement issued by the Chief Minister’s House here.
In the meeting chaired by the prime minister, the chief minister said that his government would go all-out to protect the province’s resources and the residents’ rights.
He complained about the “unjust and unfair attitude” of the federal government and said that his government would make no compromise on the province’s legitimate rights.
Mr Gandapur said that KP had 45 per cent of the country’s forests, while half of the country’s carbon credits were generated by it.

Complains about ‘hurdles’ by centre to appointment of new chief secretary

He said that the provincial government would never allow anyone to usurp those assets.
The chief minister said that 80 per cent of the forests in the province were owned by the people, and therefore, it was his responsibility as the head of the government to protect the rights of the people.
He also complained about “hurdles” by the centre to the appointment of the new chief secretary to the province and said that if the federal government thought that the province would give up its constitutional rights, then it was mistaken.
Mr Gandapur asked the centre to clear the dues of the province without delay, according to the official statement.
He also expressed “concerns” about the cases being registered against electricity consumers in the province and raids conducted on their premises and said that the federal government should better discuss the matter with KP instead of carrying out that crackdown.
The chief minister said that the federal government received Rs300 billion per year as tax on the tobacco produced by the province.
He added that like the centre, taxation was the right of the province as well.
“We will give the due tax share to the centre but we can’t let it usurp our money,” he said.
Mr Gandapur said that the federal government should take the provincial government into confidence in all its matters and decide the way forward on the issues regarding the constitutional rights of the province through mutual discussion.
In the past, too, the chief minister has complained against the centre over the denial of dues to the province.
In a meeting at the Chief Minister’s House after a cabinet meeting on March 9, Mr Gandapur told reporters that despite several reminders, the federal government didn’t make the due payments to his government.
He said that his party had political and ideological differences with those ruling the centre but still, his government wanted a good working relationship with the federal government.
The chief minister insisted that the centre had to clear the province’s Rs1,510 billion dues, but those payments hadn’t been made despite several reminders.
“I suggest that if the centre can’t do that, it should subsidise power and gas for us [KP] and deduct the amount of that subsidy from our dues,” he said.

3,Sale of illegal fuel unchecked in Jamrud,AC says crackdown planned for next week,"KHYBER: The illegal sale of petrol and diesel has badly hit the business of licensed filling stations in Jamrud tehsil here over the last few months.
The illegal “mini petrol pumps” are understood to have high sales for selling fuel at rates lower than the notified ones.
However, their petroleum products are substandard, claim the owners of the legal filling stations.
They told Dawn that a no-objection certificate was required from authorities for establishing a petrol pump, but none of those illegal petrol pumps had it.
Haji Speni Gul, the owner of a local petrol station, said there were around 12 licensed filling stations along the main road between Jamrud and Landi Kotal, but more and more mini pumps were opening due to the leniency of the district administration towards their illegal operations.

AC says crackdown planned for next week

“These people bring petrol and diesel from the local suppliers in small quantities as oil companies don’t provide them with fuel for being unregistered,” he told Dawn.
Shareefullah, a manager at another petrol pump, said the lower prices of fuel sold by the illegal outlets had adversely affected the sales of some lawful petrol pumps in the last six to seven months.
He said some filing station owners were considering closing their businesses due to the continuous losses.
Resident Sajjad Gul said the presence of illegal petrol pumps in crowded marketplaces and residential areas threatened public life and property as none of them hadn’t taken safety measures.
He said substandard fuel, mostly bought by taxi drivers, also damaged automobile engines.
When contacted, assistant commissioner of Jamrud Ameer Zeb confirmed the operations of unlawful filling stations and said the administration would crack down on them next week.
PROTEST: Scores of residents demonstrated at Bacha Khan Chowk in Landi Kotal Bazaar here on Friday complaining about “unwarranted” raids on private premises by the police and counter-terrorism department in the name of search operations against militants and wanted men.
Tehsil council chairman Shah Khalid led the demonstration, which was attended by political activists and civil society members in large numbers.
Mr Khalid insisted that conducting raids without the registration of FIRs was not only illegal but also violated tribal traditions.
He said the residents were law-abiding citizens and respected laws but wouldn’t allow anyone to unlawfully enter their houses at night, and that, too, in plain clothes.
The council chairman alleged that an elderly tribesman was killed in crossfire in Jamrud as the police entered a house without search warrants to arrest a suspected criminal.
He insisted that a similar incident was reported in Landi Kotal last night.
Mr Khalid warned that law-enforcement agencies could run into trouble if they continued with nighttime raids without taking elders and influential people into confidence.
The demonstrators demanded that the DPO hold an impartial inquiry into those raids to the relief of residents.

The event on food and nutrition security was organised by the Lasoona Organisation with commissioner of Malakand Division Saqib Raza Aslam in attendance as a special guest.
Participants included Lasoona Organisation chief executive officer Azam Khan, deputy director of the education department Gul Raj Khan, and health and nutrition experts Noor Malik and Anwar Ali.
Representatives of the education, health, and agriculture departments in Swat, Shangla, and Kohistan districts, civil society members, health experts, social activists, local elders, and parents also attended the workshop.
The speakers claimed that more than half of the people in Swat, Shangla, and Kohistan districts suffered from malnutrition.
Official Gul Raj highlighted a lack of awareness among rural communities, especially women and children, of nutrition and proper food and sanitation practices.
He said that more and more such activities should be organised to address the issue of malnutrition effectively. The speakers noted that a high incidence of malnutrition was reported in hilly areas like Shangla and Kohistan, affecting not only children and women but men as well.
They urged both nongovernmental organisations and government administrations to play a role in addressing the health issue.
The speakers said that poverty was a significant factor contributing to the rising malnutrition cases, with many people in rural areas having limited employment opportunities and facing joblessness.
They added that it was essential to improve economic conditions to enable households to provide balanced and nutritious diets for themselves and their children.
Malakand commissioner Saqib Raza Aslam expressed satisfaction with the efforts of the Lasoona Organisation and its partners in promoting food security and ensuring the better nutrition of children in parts of Swat and Shangla.
He, however, said there was a need for improvements to the project.
The commissioner gave suggestions to the Lasoona Organisation and expressed hope for continued progress in food and nutrition security in the underprivileged areas.
