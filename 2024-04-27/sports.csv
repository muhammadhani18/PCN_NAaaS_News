0,Transfer of cops having links with dacoits creates panic,IG Memon allays fears saying these cops sent to headquarters to face departmental action,"The reported transfer of policemen of Shikarpur having links with Kacha dacoits to Karachi has sent shockwaves in the civic and political circles.
A total of 79 police personnel were transferred from district Shikarpur - 74 to Karachi and six to Hyderabad. These cops were thrown out of Shikarpur over their links with robbers.
The notification to transfer these police officials to Karachi was enough to press the panic button fanning apprehensions of development of a kidnapping network between Karachi and the Kacha areas.
However, IG Sindh Ghulam Nabi Memon when contacted told The Express Tribune that the impression is wrong that police officers transferred from district Shikarpur to Karachi and Hyderabad will be posted while investigation is going on against them.
""These tainted officers have been transferred to Karachi and Hyderabad, but they will not get postings, rather they will face departmental and legal action,"" IG Memon said.
In response to a question, he said that SSP Shikarpur has sent a letter levelling allegations against the said policemen having links with dacoits and also being directly involved in kidnapping for ransom, extortion and other crimes.
In response to the letter, the establishment division has sent these officials to Karachi and Hyderabad range and these police officials will not be posted but an inquiry will be made against them by DIG or SSP rank officer.
If police officers are found to be involved in patronising criminals, they will be suspended and legal action will be taken against them. He said that those police officers and officials who are involved in abuse of office and patronage of crime are sent to the ""blacklist company"" established at the Garden Police Headquarters where officers are transferred on conviction.
A departmental inquiry is also conducted against such police officers and personnel and whoever is found guilty in this has to face other punishments including termination of employment.
In this regard, police sources said that no departmental action was taken against the said personnel.
