0,Nawaz to reclaim party reins from Shehbaz,PML-N Punjab leaders unanimously pass resolution urging the comeback of Nawaz as party president,"The PML-N leaders, spearheaded by the party’s Punjab president, appear to have kicked off a campaign to dethrone party president Shehbaz Sharif by pushing through a resolution during what was dubbed as a PML-N Punjab meeting.
The assembled leaders unanimously endorsed a resolution urging the comeback of Nawaz Sharif as party president.
The announcement came during a press briefing convened at the party's central secretariat by PML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah, with prominent PML-N figures Javed Latif and Khurram Dastgir by his side.
The optics of Sanaullah and Latif shoulder to shoulder seemed designed to quash any notion of internal discord, following their public sparring.
Speaking to the press, Sanaullah declared that PML-N Punjab had unanimously endorsed a resolution urging Nawaz Sharif to reassume leadership of the party in order to steer it through challenging times, to enhance the party's public image.
Sanaullah also lauded not only Nawaz Sharif but also Maryam Nawaz for her dynamic leadership in Punjab as CM Punjab. He also made a mention of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's performance in his remarks, although this appeared to be more of a balancing act.
Oddly enough, several Punjab leaders claimed ignorance about such a gathering, raising doubts about the guise under which this purported meeting of PML-N Punjab was held.
Khawaja Mansha Ullah Butt, one of these leaders, stated that he had no knowledge of any such meeting. He went on to suggest that the meeting in question might have been a routine gathering of leaders.
When questioned about his stance, he clarified that he held the position of vice president in PML-N Punjab.
The announcement was largely seen as Nawaz's camp trying to claw back the control from the party president Shehbaz Sharif. Despite holding independent views, which sometimes diverge significantly from those of Nawaz, the younger Sharif does not have a faction of his own.
Sanaullah and Javed had recently adopted stances that were detrimental to the central government. However, despite this, they were endorsed by Nawaz Sharif, who believed that their positions could potentially benefit the party in the future by crafting a narrative portraying them as victims. As a result, no action was taken against them.
Rana Sanaullah stated that PML-N Punjab unanimously adopted a resolution urging Nawaz Sharif to reclaim leadership of the party, denouncing his removal as a “conspiracy”.
He mentioned that all officebearers deliberated on pre- and post-election scenarios, and based on those discussions, put forth practical recommendations for implementation.
He mentioned that these recommendations have been noted and will be presented to the leadership.
Moreover, he highlighted the session's acknowledgement of the endeavours of the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led central government, backed wholeheartedly by Nawaz Sharif, in navigating the country through crises.
The gathering also commended CM Punjab Maryam Nawaz for her dynamic leadership, which has led to comprehensive relief measures, curbed price hikes, and improved the quality of life for ordinary citizens.
He also addressed the tiff between himself and Javed Latif, stating that both of his colleagues, sitting on his left and right, belong to a political party where people do not shy away from expressing their views. While they may disagree with each other's opinions, they certainly respect them.
During the brief question and answer session, when Sanaullah was queried about whether PML-N was altering its narrative and if so, whether this entailed a change in presidency, he clarified that they were not altering or removing their president.
Instead, he asserted that Nawaz was unjustly ousted, and their aim was simply to correct that injustice.
Regarding the narrative, Sanaullah asserted that Nawaz's decision prevailed.
Interestingly, when questioned about whether there was any consideration within PML-N that the Nawaz Sharif faction, alluding to those prominent figures on the political stage, might have been intentionally defeated to fade into obscurity, it was acknowledged that such sentiment did indeed exist within the party. This was discussed during the meeting.
Whatever decision is ultimately made regarding this matter will also influence the party’s narrative.
It appeared that the party is attempting to utilize a victim narrative, despite having control over all branches of government.
Meanwhile, he also clarified that at no point was Nawaz Sharif excluded from the decision-making process, emphasising that all decisions were made in direct consultation with him.
He explained that the party had been in election mode previously, which is why this change was not implemented earlier. He also hinted at forthcoming changes within the party's ranks and files.

2,Imran gives PTI go-ahead for talks,Shibli Faraz stresses need to nail down TORs before initiating negotiations,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan has given the green light to his party for negotiations with both the establishment and political adversaries.
However, the former prime minister, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail, made it clear that any talks must play by the rulebook, stressing the party's willingness to sit down with both the powers that be and political adversaries for the greater good.
He also stressed the need to nail down the Terms of Reference (TORs) before any discussions kick off.
Confirming the talks, PTI leader Shibli Faraz laid out the party's conditions for talks during an informal conversation with the media on Saturday while underscoring the importance of setting the right scene for negotiations.
He asserted that talks in an atmosphere of oppression would be a non-starter, adding that PTI's willingness to negotiate is contingent upon the creation of a conducive atmosphere for constructive dialogue.
“The manner in which the negotiations will take place and in what environment should be decided first, only then will the way for the negotiations be paved with those who are the stakeholders,” he added.
Faraz said PTI is a reality and so is the establishment.
Emphasising the principle of justice, Faraz called for the expeditious resolution of what he termed as ""politically-motivated"" cases, calling for adherence to the rule of law and the constitution.
He further urged for the release of PTI female members and political detainees, insisting that legal proceedings should only be pursued where justified.
Faraz stressed the importance of political freedom and activity for the PTI, asserting that the party should be afforded the liberty to operate without undue hindrance.
Moreover, he proposed the establishment of an independent judicial commission to investigate injustices against the PTI and urged for expedited adjudication by election tribunals on electoral irregularities within a timeframe of 30 days.
Faraz also revealed plans for the PTI to publish a white paper documenting instances of rigging and malpractices in elections.
Reiterating the PTI's commitment to national unity, Faraz affirmed, ""Pakistan Army is our army too,"" underscoring the party's dedication to fostering political and economic stability through dialogue and cooperation rather than political vendettas.

On the same day, PTI leader Shehryar Afridi expressed intentions to engage in discussions with the military establishment. Afridi, speaking to a private TV channel, indicated that talks with the army chief and DG ISI would take place soon.
Afridi clarified that PTI's objective is not to seek a National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) for itself but rather to negotiate for the betterment of Pakistan's future.
He also mentioned Imran Khan's longstanding desire to engage with the establishment from day one, lamenting the absence of a response thus far.

3,PM purges FBR of corrupt officials,"25 ‘incompetent, compromised’ officers removed on basis of spy agencies’ reports","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday removed from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) 25 officers, who were in higher pay grades of 21 and 22, on the basis of the input from three intelligence agencies about their financial integrity and competence.
Among those who have been ousted included the top tier members of the board, chief commissioners and a former FBR chairman, who was already without a position for the past two years.
Their replacements will be from among those who have been declared competent and righteous by the three intelligence agencies, according to government officials.
In place of those purged out of FBR, the government has made transfer and postings of 25 FBR officers. They include those who are below the par but are serving at key positions of the ‘A’ category postings.
It was the first such drastic step being taken by a democratically elected chief minister of the country to weed out the officers having either tainted reputation or were lacking in competency as well as public dealing.
The move marks the government’s commitment to put the FBR’s house in order.
It was also the second time in less than a week that the premier decisively took action to give a clear message about his commitment to make the FBR a reformed organisation.
Earlier, the premier suspended a senior FBR officer for his negligence in following a court case.
The suspended officer is also among the 25 FBR employees, who have been found lacking on multiple professional counts.
On the advice from the Prime Minister’s Office, the FBR on Friday issued the notifications for the removal of 13 officers, who were serving in grade 21 and 22 with immediate effect.
Another 12 officers who were either already having no positions or are working on deputation in other ministries were recalled.
A cabinet member told The Express Tribune that in the first phase grade 21 and 22 officers have been removed from their positions belonging to both the Inland Revenue Service and the Customs Group.
In the second phase, grade 20 officers will be removed from the FBR and the intelligence agencies are giving the final shape to their names.
Out of the 25, 14 tainted or incompetent officers in the eyes of the intelligence agencies belong to the Inland Revenue Service and 11 to the Customs Group.
There were eight officers of the Inland Revenue Service and Customs Group who were on deputation. However, the premier has asked for their immediate repatriation from the law ministry, maritime affairs ministry, Establishment Division and the State Life Insurance Corporation to that they could be appointed as officers on special duty (OSDs) to take authoritative action against them in the form of their removal. Four other officers are already working as OSDs in the board.
PM Shehbaz had ordered the three intelligence agencies and the FBR top management to assess the top tier of the tax machinery on the basis of their financial integrity, competence and public dealing.
On the basis of the input from the intelligence agencies, the government divided the FBR officers serving in grade 20 to 22 in four categories. The clean and competent officers will be given the top positions of the members, chief commissioners and chief collectors.
The federal government has taken a bold step by removing these officers, just weeks before the new budget and in the middle of the peak revenue collection season.
The premier seems willing to take a hit on the revenues for the sake of improving the standing of the rotting tax machinery.
Sources said now only category ‘A’ officers of good reputation as well as skills would be given the FBR’s top managerial positions including the members of the board, chief commissioners, commissioners, chief collectors and collectors.
The category ‘B’ officers will relatively receive less important positions.
The category ‘C’ officers will be sidelined.
The category ‘D’ officers were removed on Friday and placed in the administration pool of the FBR, meaning that they are without any position.
PM Shehbaz personally made sure that action was taken against all these officers by denying them any posting.
The PM’s Office further instructed the FBR to write letters to immediately call back those officers who were serving on deputation in other ministries and appellate tribunals.
The grade 21 officers who have been removed include the Input-Output Coefficient, director general member accounting, Karachi chief commissioner, Internal Audit director general, member policy, a former FBR chairman, accountant members of appellate tribunal, the State Life Insurance Corporation executive director, member customs operations, Law and Prosecution director general, Customs Valuations director general, Karachi chief collector appraisement, member technical customs and member technical of the Customs appellate tribunal.
Some of these officers have faced inquiries in the past, but the FBR never took any action against them.
The government was in the process of finalising the replacements of these top positions that could not be kept vacant because of their importance in revenue collection.
The sources said that in the second phase the category ‘C’ officers would be sidelined from their positions.
Among them are a director general of investigation and intelligence wing of the FBR and a grade-22 member of the Inland Revenue.
Furthermore, the government on Friday also appointed McKinsey and Company, a globally renowned consulting firm, for the digitisation project.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will pay the fee to McKinsey for its consultancy services.
The federal finance minister was briefed about the procurement process, which involved technical evaluation by an approved committee comprising senior officials from FBR and technical experts from Karandaaz Pakistan.
McKinsey and Company emerged as the top bidder after thorough evaluation of technical and financial aspects.
The negotiated full and final proposal from McKinsey and Company was presented to the committee. The body gave the mod to grant the contract to McKinsey and Company and commencing the project.
The meeting concluded with the agreement on the next steps for commencement of the process of digitisation of the FBR's operations through collaboration between board and the private sector for a digitally empowered tax ecosystem in the country.
