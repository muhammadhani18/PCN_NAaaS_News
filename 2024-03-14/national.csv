0,Corporate dividends hit record $1.66tr,"The world’s biggest dividend payers in 2023 were Microsoft, followed by Apple and Exxon Mobil","Corporate dividends globally hit an all-time high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, with record payouts by banks making up half of the growth, a report showed on Wednesday.
On a worldwide basis, 86% of listed companies either increased dividends or maintained them, according to the quarterly Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index (JHGDI) report, which also forecast that dividend payouts would hit a new record of $1.72 trillion this year.
The world’s biggest dividend payers in 2023 were Microsoft, followed by Apple and Exxon Mobil.
The total value of corporate dividends rose from $1.57 trillion in 2022 with underlying growth – which accounts for currency movements, special dividends, timing changes and index changes – of 5% from 2022, UK asset manager Janus Henderson said.
“Corporate cash flow in most sectors remained strong and this provided plenty of firepower for dividends and share buybacks,” said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson.

1,Rupee appreciates to 5-month high,"Wednesday’s close was the highest level since October 17, 2023, when rupee stood at Rs277.03/$","Pakistani currency on Wednesday hit almost five-month high at Rs278.78 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market ahead of talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for releasing the last tranche of $1.1 billion and securing a new, larger loan programme.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee gained 0.11%, or Rs0.30, compared to Monday’s close at Rs279.08 against the greenback. With the latest appreciation, the currency has cumulatively risen 10.16%, or Rs28.32, in the past six months since plunging to the all-time low close at Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
The Wednesday’s close was the highest level since October 17, 2023, when rupee stood at Rs277.03/$. Market talk suggests that the supply of foreign currency remained higher than its demand as exporters were selling the greenback on futures counters in anticipation dollar inflows would improve following receipt of IMF’s last loan tranche of $1.1 billion in March-April 2024. Moreover, talks for a new and larger IMF loan package will further accelerate the flow of the greenback. 
Pakistan received more dollars on account of improved remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis to their family members and friends back home to help them cope with high inflation during Ramazan and meet Eid expenditures.
According to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, the rupee appreciated Rs0.25 to Rs281.22/$ in the open market. Accordingly, the disparity between the two currency markets further narrowed to Rs2.44 (0.87%) compared to more than Rs3 (over 1%) in the recent past. The IMF has recommended the maximum ceiling of 1.25% (around Rs4).
Gold down
Gold price on Wednesday decreased Rs1,800 to Rs228,300 per tola (11.66 grams) in line with the global trend. The precious metal in the international commodity market dropped $18 to $2,179 per ounce (31.10 grams).

2,Bears tighten grip ahead of IMF review,"KSE-100 index dives 753.26 points, settles at 64,048.44","Bears remained in firm grip of proceedings at Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as the KSE-100 index extended losses and recorded a decline of over 750 points due to concerns about the upcoming monetary policy and the fate of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme review.
Earlier, trading began on a robust note when the index touched its intra-day high of 65,043.37 points. The market remained steady till midday with some ups and downs, but after that it took a dive.
Selling pressure prevailed as pessimistic investors pulled the index down in the absence of clarity about the outcome of IMF’s second review under the $3 billion standby arrangement (SBA).
Bearish sentiment deepened ahead of the monetary policy announcement on March 18.
Furthermore, car sales dropped to 9,709 units in February, marking an 8% month-on-month decline and the absence of major positive triggers led to across-the-board selling, taking the index to the intra-day low of 63,856.51.
The KSE-100 dipped over 750 points to close below the 64,000 mark.
“Stocks closed sharply lower amid uncertainty about the outcome of IMF’s second review under the $3 billion SBA and discussions over a new Extended Fund Facility,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Dismal data of car sales that fell 41% year-on-year in Jul-Feb FY24 and uncertainty about the monetary policy announcement on March 18 played the role of catalysts in negative close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a plunge of 753.26 points, or 1.16%, and settled at 64,048.44.
Topline Securities, in its report, said the day commenced on a promising note for the equity market when the KSE-100 index surged to the intra-day high of 65,043, marking a notable increase of 241.67 points in the morning session.
However, as the day unfolded, a shift towards profit-taking ensued, which swiftly turned into widespread selling across the board, it said. Consequently, the index struggled to maintain its momentum above the 65,000 level.
“The sudden surge in selling pressure can be attributed to the absence of significant positive triggers, with investors adopting a cautious stance amidst anticipation surrounding the upcoming IMF talks and the monetary policy announcement on March 18.”
Several sectors including exploration and production (E&P), automotive, banking and technology contributed to the index’s decline. Among these sectors, Mari Petroleum Company Limited, Pakistan Petroleum, Millat Tractors, Pakistan State Oil, TRG Pakistan and Habib Bank collectively shed 266 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted “another down day” for Pakistan stocks with the KSE-100 reverting to 64,000.
“KSE-100 is now back into the ‘general election gap’, which had been a stubborn resistance on the way up and is now expected to offer support,” it said. The report anticipated new all-time highs in the near term.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the bourse experienced a significant sell-off following Tuesday’s crash.
The KSE-100 index fluctuated between a high and low of 65,043 and 63,856. The market concluded at 64,048, down 753 points. “Investor participation remained notably low,” he said.
“Looking ahead, we advise investors to exercise caution at these levels and wait for opportunities during market dips,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 252.8 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 321.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs9.2 billion.
Shares of 329 companies were traded. Of these, 52 stocks closed higher, 257 dropped and 20 remained unchanged.
Cnergyico PK was the volume leader with trading in 19.9 million shares, losing Rs0.14 to close at Rs4.63. It was followed by The Bank of Punjab with 18.7 million shares, losing Rs0.15 to close at Rs6.02 and K-Electric with 14.4 million shares, losing Rs0.14 to close at Rs4.40.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs706.2 million during the trading session, according to the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL).

3,Experts call for regulation of ChatGPT in education,"Urge stakeholders to combat misuse of AI, encourage critical thinking to safeguard learning integrity","In every field, technology is poised to be a game-changer in the future, but addressing the misuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT calls for the formulation of comprehensive AI rules, said tech mavens.
Experts stress the need for collaborative efforts among stakeholders to establish guidelines that promote responsible usage and aid learners in honing their abilities within educational institutions.
Recent trends indicate a concerning rise in students resorting to ChatGPT for academic dishonesty, bypassing traditional research methods and plagiarising content for assignments. While ChatGPT is designed to aid learning, experts caution against its misuse, stressing the critical importance of thoughtful and disciplined usage.
They have stressed that ChatGPT is intended to support and enrich learning, rather than encourage laziness. Its impact on youths hinges on their usage—while it can foster creativity and productivity, unchecked reliance may result in passivity. Encouraging thoughtful and disciplined utilisation is essential. Educators, parents, and learners bear the responsibility to promote active engagement and learning, steering clear of fostering passivity or dependency.

Pakistan Freelancers Association (PAFLA), President and CEO, Tufail Ahmed Khan stressed the need for educational institutions to update their assessment methods to mitigate the misuse of ChatGPT. He points out that traditional assignment copying predates ChatGPT and other alternatives like Google have always existed. Khan advocated for emphasising critical thinking and personalised tasks to evaluate student capabilities effectively and deter reliance on AI for assignments. Moreover, he underscored the importance of establishing ethical guidelines and legal frameworks to govern ChatGPT’s application, focusing on promoting societal benefits while preventing harm. Recognising AI’s potential for job creation, Khan suggested that guidelines should strike a balance between technological advancement and responsible use, drawing insights from global practices to ensure that AI tools like ChatGPT enhance productivity without compromising ethics.
He highlighted that ChatGPT has the potential to foster creativity and innovation by facilitating brainstorming and enhancing conceptual understanding. It acts as a tool for learners to delve into ideas and refine original thoughts, enabling a deeper engagement with content. Utilising ChatGPT as a starting point enables learners to broaden their creative horizons and devise unique solutions.
SI Global Solutions, CEO, Noman Said suggested that educational institutions can combat ChatGPT misuse by equipping teachers with AI literacy. This entails understanding AI’s capabilities and limitations, deploying AI monitoring tools, and crafting assignments that promote originality and creativity. He highlighted that effective AI regulation requires collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including the government, technology experts, educators, and the public. Clear guidelines should prioritise ethical use, data privacy, and equitable access to ensure AI serves society’s broader interests while protecting individual rights.
He noted that ChatGPT can foster creativity as a collaborative tool, challenging learners to question and build upon the information provided. Encouraging exploration, critical analysis, and the pursuit of unique ideas facilitates the development of innovative thinking skills beyond memorised responses.

4,Rise in used car imports raises alarm,Surge by staggering 684% in first six months reflecting consumer preference,"The import of used cars has seen a staggering surge of 684% in the first six months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period last year. Sources indicate that over 16,500 units of used cars were imported from July to December 2023, marking an exponential increase compared to the approximately 2,100 used cars imported in the fiscal year 2022-23.
This data reflects the preference for used imported cars among Pakistanis over locally assembled cars, as imported cars typically offer additional features not commonly found in locally assembled ones.
Breaking down the categories, there was a significant uptick in the import of economy and small low-segment cars, with almost 9,900 units brought in, along with commercial vehicles, SUVs, and vans, which saw nearly 6,600 units imported. Furthermore, luxury vehicle imports also saw a notable spike, among other categories.
Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts & Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), Chairman, Abdul Rehman Aizaz attributed this phenomenal increase in used car imports to the removal of regulatory duty in the federal budget for FY2023-24 on used cars of up to 1800cc.
He noted that while this move was intended to revitalise the automotive sector, it has proven detrimental to the local auto industry. This trend bears significant economic implications, particularly for local vendors, who are facing an estimated loss of a staggering Rs36 billion, pushing them towards closure of their businesses.

He pointed out the irony that the elimination of the 100% regulatory duty only benefits importers and companies dealing in Completely Built Units (CBUs), without offering any relief to the struggling local industry, which already faces significant demand-supply challenges.
Moreover, Aizaz highlighted that the replacement of locally produced cars with imported used vehicles is resulting in substantial revenue losses for the government, as taxes and duties that would have been generated from locally produced cars are now being missed out on. He explained that under the previous policy, the government received a fixed amount of dollars in taxes regardless of the original market prices of cars, whereas now duties and taxes are based on ex-factory prices, resulting in potential revenue shortfalls.
The surge in used car imports presents both challenges and opportunities for the automotive sector and policymakers alike, necessitating a careful reassessment of policies to ensure sustainable growth and support for local industries.
“The perception is being built in the minds of local customers that imported cars are more reliable, both in terms of body strength and features,” said Nauman Ali, a Lahore-based imported car dealer. This perception is somewhat factual, he added.
He explained that there are many variants available in used cars, which are often costly but mostly fall within the customers’ spending power for cars, since the prices of locally manufactured cars are also at an all-time high.
“This creates healthy competition, which forces many local assemblers to add more features to their variants. We are now living in a rapidly developing technological world, where the customer is the ultimate power, and the fact is that local customers, especially those living in first-tier cities, are more inclined towards imported cars,” Ali added.

5,No mini-budget despite missed target,FBR assures govt of meeting annual target of over Rs9.4 trillion,"The new government won’t need to introduce a mini-budget despite missing tax targets for the last two consecutive months, as the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has assured it will achieve the annual target of over Rs9.4 trillion without additional measures. The chances of immediately introducing a scheme to impose income tax on retailers have also diminished, as Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb decided to further scrutinise the plan.
The FBR’s assurance about achieving the annual target comes amid the government’s hopes of securing a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday for the final $1.1 billion loan tranche. Finance Minister Aurangzeb took a briefing from the tax machinery on the status of tax collection and various digitisation initiatives. The finance minister also urged the FBR to expand the tax base through investment in technology instead of seeking to fill around 5,000 vacant positions.
The briefing coincided with the IMF mission landing in Pakistan to conduct the second review of Pakistan’s economy for October-December period under the $3 billion Stand-By Agreement. The Ministry of Finance announced that Pakistan has met all structural benchmarks, qualitative performance criteria, and indicative targets for the successful completion of the IMF review. This will be the final review of the Stand-By Arrangement, with a staff-level agreement expected afterward, said the ministry.
The finance ministry said that the second review of Stand-By Arrangement with IMF is scheduled from March 14 to March 18, 2024, in Islamabad. Once staff level agreement is reached, the final tranche of $1.1 billion will be disbursed, following the approval of the Executive Board of the IMF, it added.

Earlier, the finance minister expressed Pakistan’s interest in securing a longer and larger IMF loan programme. Chairman FBR Amjad Zubair Tiwana briefed the finance minister on the status of tax collection, assuring that the annual target could be achieved without additional revenue measures.
Although the FBR collected Rs5.83 trillion in taxes and achieved the eight-month target, it had missed the last two months’ targets. The FBR believes it has justification for these misses, and the IMF would not push hard to introduce a mini-budget.
The finance minister was also briefed about various initiatives, including a plan to bring retailers into the next net through a simple tax scheme. Aurangzeb did not immediately give a go-ahead to the scheme, but said that it would be further examined. The FBR chairman said in the meeting that the retailers’ scheme may initially be used as a source for the registration of the retailers instead of using it as a tool to enhance tax collection.
The finance minister instructed the FBR to bifurcate the data of the 3.5 million retailers between big and small – as over 3.2 million of them remain outside the FBR’s tax net.
During last week’s meeting, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also asked the FBR to focus on wholesalers and distributors instead of narrowing down solely on retailers. According to the Ministry of Finance statement, Aurangzeb said that the government was considering strategies to broaden the tax base by incorporating wholesale, retail, real estate, and agriculture sectors into the tax framework.
The FBR raised the issue of about 5,000 vacant positions in the FBR and sought to hire people, asking to increase their budget equal to 0.8% of the annual collection. However, the finance minister urged the FBR to see whether the investment should be made in human resources or technology. He also directed to strengthen the point of sale and track and trace initiatives, which have so far failed to deliver the desired results. He sought separate briefings on these initiatives.
The finance minister praised the Custom Department’s Single Window initiative, which has been implemented to digitally link various stakeholders involved in international trade. 
The finance ministry stated that Aurangzeb stressed the urgent need for digitising the FBR to enhance transparency and efficiency in tax collection. These initiatives would focus on enhancing tax collection through improved FBR governance, comprehensive documentation of the economy, and full-scale digitisation, according to Aurangzeb.
The finance minister also stated that digitisation is a means to an end and implementing digital solutions is pivotal to modernising our tax administration. 
He said that by leveraging technology and enhancing transparency, we can build a more equitable tax system that fosters economic growth and benefits all citizens. 
The finance minister pledged the government’s support in implementing transformative measures.

6,Mobile banking users grow 8% to 16m,SBP’s Q2 report highlights progress in payment ecosystem,"Mobile and internet banking users reached 16 million and 11 million, respectively, in the second quarter of financial year 2023-24, indicating quarterly growth of 8% and 5%.
The Quarterly Payment Systems Review for the second quarter of 2023-24, released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Wednesday, highlighted significant progress in Pakistan’s payment ecosystem and provided a comprehensive overview of digital payments landscape.
The user base of payments infrastructure experienced growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec). Mobile and internet banking remains the preferred mode of digital transactions for Pakistanis.
With the growth in mobile and internet banking users, the number of e-wallets registered with Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) increased 15% to 2.7 million during the quarter, marking more than twofold rise in the last four quarters.
In addition, over 67 million m-wallets were registered with branchless banking service providers.

During the second quarter, the retail transactions processed by banks, microfinance banks (MFBs) and EMIs showed a quarterly growth of 15%, a significant increase compared to the 5% growth in the previous quarter. Volumes of digital transactions constituted 82% of the overall retail transactions during the quarter under review compared to 80% during the previous quarter. However, in terms of value, over-the-counter (OTC) transactions constituted 85% of the overall retail transactions.
In the same quarter, more than 90% of retail fund transfers and 73% of bill payments/mobile top-ups were conducted using digital channels. Last quarter, these shares were 88% and 68%, respectively.
Instant payment system Raast and real-time gross settlement system (PRISM) significantly contributed to the digital financial services nationwide. Raast played a pivotal role by facilitating 107 million fund transfer transactions free of cost, totaling more than Rs2 trillion in 2QFY24. In the same quarter, the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system processed 1.5 million large-value payments, amounting to Rs273 trillion.

8,Oil prices may be left unchanged in Ramazan,Estimates show mixed trend in movement of petroleum product prices,"The federal government may decide to keep ex-depot prices of petroleum products unchanged for the upcoming fortnight from March 16 to 31, apparently to provide some relief during Ramazan as people were already reeling from the persistently high inflation.
The movement in petroleum product prices has shown a mixed trend where the price of petrol has increased whereas rates of other products have gone down.
Estimates of oil marketing companies, based on current tax rates, reveal slight changes in prices of all four petroleum products due to a high premium on petrol and insignificant increase in fuel prices globally.
Crude benchmark Brent has hovered around $81 per barrel in the international market since March 1, 2024.
In addition to taxes, inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) is imposed on petrol at the rate of Rs7.01 per litre and on high-speed diesel at Rs3.76 per litre.
Estimates suggest that the price of petrol may go up by Rs1.07 per litre due to a higher premium of $12.15 per barrel compared to the premium of $10.48 per barrel in the current fortnight, up $1.67.
If the government approves the increase in petrol price, it will rise from Rs279.75 to Rs280.82 per litre.
Read: Petroleum demand hits 5-month low
However, prices of other petroleum products may come down. The price of high-speed diesel is estimated to edge down 82 paisa from Rs287.33 to Rs286.51 per litre.
The premium on diesel is $6.50 per barrel, unchanged from the current fortnight.
The price of kerosene oil is expected to decrease 94 paisa from Rs190.01 to Rs189.07 per litre while the rate of light diesel oil is estimated to fall Rs1.56 from Rs170.27 to Rs168.71 per litre.
In the previous rate revision, the government had increased the price of petrol by Rs4.13 per litre with effect from March 1. At that time, the inter-bank rupee-dollar parity was at Rs279, which stands still unchanged.
High-speed diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. Any revision in its price leaves an inflationary impact on the lives of common citizens.
Petrol is mainly used in motorbikes and passenger cars and it is also an alternative to the compressed natural gas (CNG) which is consumed by many car owners.
Owing to the scarcity of locally produced gas, the transport sector in Punjab primarily uses petrol and imported liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Kerosene oil is used for cooking purposes in far-off areas of the country, especially its northern parts where liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is not readily available. Pakistan Army is also a major consumer of kerosene oil.

9,"SBP investigates misprinted Rs1,000 notes in circulation",Says faulty notes can be exchanged at any of the 16 designated offices of central bank,"Pakistan’s central bank has not ruled out the possibility of having issued misprinted banknotes of Rs1,000 to commercial banks, which subsequently reached citizens and became part of the currency in circulation, despite a sound system in place to check misprinting.
While speaking to The Express Tribune, a spokesperson for the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Wednesday that commercial banks and individuals who have received the one-sided printed notes can exchange them at the bank branches where they received the faulty notes. They can also exchange the notes at the designated 16 offices of the central bank nationwide.
Earlier, a one-minute video went viral on Tuesday, showing no printing on the backside of a few Rs1,000 notes. The video maker, who did not appear on camera but identified himself with his voice in the background as a National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) branch manager in Model Colony, Karachi, displayed the misprinted notes in his hand. He stated that they had received fresh currency notes of denominations Rs1,000, Rs500, and Rs5,000, displaying two Rs1,000 notes in his hand which appeared perfect from the front. However, when he turned the notes over, the backside printing was incomplete. He claimed that many packets of the fresh currency notes had already been delivered to customers, expressing unawareness of how many of them were misprinted.
The issue came to light when a customer returned two such notes to the bank. The manager displayed another packet of Rs1,000 notes containing two misprinted notes. He later claimed that every package contained at least two misprinted notes and questioned the situation. When NBP was approached to verify the authenticity of the video, an official stated that the case had been brought to the attention of top management and was under investigation.

The official expressed surprise that the video surfaced on a public holiday (the first day of Ramazan, Tuesday), claiming that the notes had been received that morning (presumably on the holiday morning) and distributed to the public. He doubted that the video was recorded on another day but surfaced on Tuesday, indicating its authenticity and eliminating the possibility of it being fake.
The SBP official further stated that the issued notes still retained their security features and would be checked by officials at public counters when people came to exchange the misprinted notes. He explained that while the printing press prints millions of notes in one cycle, despite having a robust system in place to double-check the quality and reject misprinted notes, there is still a chance for some misprinted notes to be mistakenly circulated.
A press statement issued by the central bank added that only 10 misprinted notes were issued to NBP’s Model Colony branch. It stated that misprinted banknotes received by the public or commercial banks could be exchanged for fit banknotes at any office of the State Bank of Pakistan Banking Services Corporation (SBP-BSC) across the country under the State Bank of Pakistan (Note Refund) Regulations, 1963.
Large-scale production processes are prone to some imperfections. Therefore, despite all quality checks, some misprinted banknotes may end up with banks or the public. However, such banknotes can be exchanged at SBP-BSC counters, it said. SBP’s printing work, namely Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC), has a robust quality control system to segregate and prevent the flow of misprinted banknotes into circulation. Although some notes are occasionally misprinted, they are detected through the checks and balances in place. However, no matter how robust and effective a manmade system is, it is still susceptible to a margin of error, whether in developed jurisdictions or elsewhere.
The current case involves the discovery of only ten (10) misprinted banknotes in the consignment of NBP’s Model Colony Branch, which is negligible compared to the total number of notes printed and circulated in the country. Nevertheless, internal controls are being strengthened to prevent such instances from recurring in the future, said the statement.
