0,Court orders SPSC to keep videos of interviews,"Results of written, viva voce should also be displayed on commission's website","The Circuit Bench of Sindh High Court comprising Justice Shamsuddin Abbasi and Justice Amjad Ali Sahito has instructed the Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) to keep photographs, audio and video recordings of the candidates undergoing interviews for recruitment in Grade 16 and above.
As per court orders, SPSC members of the interview committee should be seen in such video, and a statement of the person recording the video should also be recorded without any modification at the end of the interview. Such audio and video records must be kept in safe custody for at least three years, and in case such media goes missing, the chairman and secretary of SPSC will be responsible.
The court also directed that the results of the written examinations conducted by the SPSC and the results of the viva voce should be displayed on commission's website along with the candidates' name, seat number, father's name and marks obtained.
The landmark ruling was issued by the court in response to the constitutional petitions filed against the Sindh Public Service Commission, in which petitioners' alleged violation of merit by the commission in the recruitment of municipal officers. As many as 30 candidates had challenged the examination results for the appointments of municipal officer, town officer and assistant accounts officer through two constitutional petitions filed at the Sindh High Court. 
The court reserved the verdict after the joint hearing of the two petitions on March 12 and 13, the order of which was released on Wednesday.
In the 22-page order penned by Justice Amjad Ali Sahito, the SHC directed the petitioners to appeal to the chairman under Rule No. 161 of the SPSC (Recruitment Management) Regulations, 2023 in case of any concerns. Whereas according to the law, the chairman may decide an appeal within 45 days, the ruling will be sent to the applicant's address as well as informed through the website.
In its order, the court directed the chairman SPSC to conduct an inquiry regarding the allegations levelled by the petitioners against Rizwan Memon, a member of the interview committee. 
A committee would be formed to investigate the allegations against Rizwan Memon, hear the accused and the petitioners, following which a detailed report should be submitted to the court in two months. 
The court has also ordered that in the future no member of the interview committee will be a part of the interview panel in which any candidate, related to him, will be a participant. The chairman SPSC is ordered to ensure its implementation.
As per court orders, the petitions did not raise any objection to the process of the examinations, from the publication of the recruitment advertisement to the conduct of written examinations. However, after their failure in the interview, they raised objections to the process, and filed instant petitions. But during the hearing, no one could give any justification as to why the petitioners were targeted. 
In these circumstances, the judiciary is not convinced by the prayers of the petitioner's lawyers, demanding that the whole process of SPSC be annulled. The High Court disposed of the petitions by issuing necessary directions.

2,Multimillion-dollar project hit with delays,Work on the Red Line BRT has come to a screeching halt amidst allegations of uncooperativeness on Trans Karachi’s part,"Given the port city’s traffic conundrum and the minimal public transport options, mega projects like the Red Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) are the need of the hour, however, after being delayed for more than a decade, the project has come to a halt again.
The Red Line project, which is being constructed under the supervision of Trans Karachi, a company owned by the Sindh government, is a three phase project, which under phase one would provide transport from Model Colony to Mosmiyat, under phase two would provide transport from Mosmiyat to Numaish Chowrangi, and under phase three would provide transport from Municipal Park to Tower.
The foundation stone for phase one and phase two, which includes procurement of buses and civil works, was laid in August 2022, and was expected to be completed by 2024. However, this completion timeline has now been extended to 2026. In this regard, officials privy to the work on the project, informed the Express Tribune on the condition of anonymity that contractors engaged for the project had lost interest in it due to the uncooperativeness of officials of Trans Karachi. “The contractors had slowed down the construction work for the past several months as they were demanding an increase in their engagement rate due to the increase in the cost of construction materials. Presently, they have stopped working altogether since December,” an official disclosed.
When asked to elaborate upon how Trans Karachi was to be blamed for the work coming to a halt, the official stated that the government owned company was being run by individuals who were not appointed on merit and thus had little interest in the project. “The purpose of establishing Trans Karachi was to curtail political interference or that from the Sindh government so that it would be able to work freely and transparently. However, later on due to political pressure, nepotism won.”
“For instance, the present Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is a retired civil engineer, who has no experience in mass transit. Even if one were to disregard the lack of experience, the CEO is not invested in the project, which is evidenced by the fact that despite the closure of the project, the CEO is presently on leave.”
It is pertinent to mention that the Red Line project is multi-million dollar project, with a price tag of 503.3 million dollars, out of which the Asian Development Bank will provide 235 million dollars, the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank will provide 71.81 million dollars, the French Development Agency will provide 71.81 million dollars, while the Green Climate Fund will provide a 11.8 million dollar grant and 37.2 million dollars in loans; whereas, the Sindh government will cover the remainder 75.71 million dollars.
In light of the exorbitant cost of the project and the allegations levelled against the CEO of Trans Karachi, the Express Tribune made multiple attempts to contact the CEO, Tufail Palijo, however he did not respond. Thus, the Express Tribune, spoke with the government owned company’s General Manager Planning, Niaz Ahmed, who said that the construction work had not been stopped due to the contractors’ demands. “The construction work has only been stopped due to implementation of safety measures, such as the installation of fences around the project site,” said Ahmed.
However, when pressed about the completion timeline of the project, Ahmed conceded that the completion timeline had been extended to 2025-2026.
The Express Tribune also spoke with Sarosh Lodhi, who is the Chairman of the Trans Karachi Board, who concurred with Ahmed. “The development work has only been stopped for the installation of safety measures. As far as the engagement rate of the contractors is concerned, an increase in their rate has already been addressed and a notification will be issued soon.”
When asked about the allegations of nepotism against Trans Karachi’s CEO, Lodhi told the Express Tribune that he was not aware of the terms of appointment of the CEO, therefore could not comment on his appointment.

Zafar Mahmood, the newly appointed IRSA chairman, has been an outspoken supporter of Kalabagh Dam, dismissing the concerns of the provinces like Sindh, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan. His appointment has raised objections, not only from the public but also from writers, civil society members, and even leaders within the ruling PPP.
""Zafar Mahmood has consistently rejected Sindh and smaller provinces' concerns over the controversial dam, especially Kalabagh. How can one accept this appointment?"" questioned PPP leader and former senator Sassi Palejo. PPP leaders in Sindh have vowed to approach the federal government to reconsider the decision.
In addition to discussing the IRSA chairman's appointment, the cabinet set a wheat procurement target of 900,000 tons at Rs4,000 per 40kg. Attendees at the cabinet meeting included provincial ministers, advisors, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, advocate general, prosecutor general, and others.

He directed the home minister to make the SHOs and SSPs of the area accountable. 
It may be noted that 7,822 cases of street crime in Karachi were recorded in January 2024, 5,876 in February and 2,234 in March (till 12 March). 
The cabinet was told that out of 78 cases of kidnapping, 49 have been recovered and 29 were still outstanding. Out of 29 kidnapping cases, six belong to Ghotki, nine to Shikarpur, and 14 to Kashmore. It was pointed out that the kidnapping cases have increased due to tribal feuds. At this, the CM directed the home minister to involve a few ministers, district administration and the police to resolve tribal feuds at the earliest.

5,Kidnapping drama unravels as two siblings return home,Ayan and Anabiya say they fled home due to bad treatment at their grandparents' home,"Two young siblings who allegedly went missing from North Nazimabad have been found after 16 hours in a dramatic turn of events. 
They were handed over to police by the Rangers as the paramilitary force spokesperson said that they were kidnapped and the kidnappers had called their mother to demand Rs1 million ransom. Police, on the other hand, believe that the two siblings had left home on their own due to the bad treatment they received at the house of their grandparents.As per details, 12-year-old Ayan and 11-year-old Anabiya, residents of North Nazimabad Block H, left their home at 11 o'clock on Tuesday night to buy chips but did not return. After searching the surroundings, the family contacted Hyderi police, which registered a case of abduction based on the statement of the maternal uncle, Salman.
The maternal uncle told The Express Tribune that the children's parents had separated eight years ago. Their mother, Shumaila Naz, currently resides in Dubai and is a TikToker. The children live with their grandmother, and the family claims to have no enmity with anyone.
In a surprising turn of events, the alleged abduction reached its anticlimax. Shumaila Naz confirmed that her children had been found. According to a Rangers spokesperson, the children's mother received a call from abroad demanding a ransom of Rs1 million. Utilising modern technical means, Rangers and police tracked the children as soon as they received the information. The kidnappers left the children in the Hydari area to avoid arrest and fled.
However, SSP Central Zeshan Siddiqui claims that the siblings admitted in their statements that they had left home willingly. Ayan, in his statement in police custody, said, ""We left the house of our own free will and spent the night at an uncle's house.""
According to Ayan's younger sister, their grandmother used to abuse them, while the aunt compelled them to clean the bathroom and wash the dishes. Police are conducting further investigations into the incident.
