1,BMC suspends 40 absentee doctors,"There will be zero tolerance for absentee teachers and doctors, the CM announced","The Balochistan government has launched a crackdown against the chronic absentee doctors, medical professionals and teachers across the province. As part of this drive, for the first time 40 doctors and other health professionals were suspended at the province’s largest government-run hospital on Wednesday.
In a decisive move aimed at ensuring uninterrupted healthcare services, the Medical Superintendent of Bolan Medical Complex Hospital (BMC) has taken action against doctors absent from their duties, suspending 20 doctors and medical staff members.
The directive came following a surprise visit by Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti to BMC Hospital last night, during which he expressed his firm commitment to upholding public health standards and made the staff accountable for their deeds.
The unannounced visit by Chief Minister Bugti underscored the government’s dedication to monitoring and improving healthcare facilities across the province.
Upon founding several doctors and paramedics absent from duty at the hospital, he promptly ordered the suspension of those found neglecting their duties.
“No failure will be tolerated in providing health facilities to the people,” Chief Minister Bugti emphasized, urging the paramount importance of delivering quality healthcare services to the citizens of Balochistan.
Furthermore, in line with the Chief Minister’s directive, the Medical Superintendent of BMC Hospital has also forwarded a formal letter to the Health Secretary, detailing the suspensions and outlining further departmental actions to ensure accountability and efficiency within the healthcare system.
The swift and decisive action taken by the government reflects its unwavering commitment to prioritizing public health and ensuring that medical facilities operate at optimal capacity to serve the needs of the people of Balochistan.
It may be recalled that on March 6, Bugti stressed the absolute necessity for the presence of teachers in schools and medical personnel in hospitals, ensuring there will be no compromises on this essential matter.
“There will be zero tolerance for absentee teachers and doctors,” the CM announced. Recognizing the evolving demands of the modern era, Bugti has underscored the importance of integrating skills.

2,Sehat Card back in full operation,Free treatment reinstated; counters reactivated,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government has fully restored the free treatment facility on Sehat Insaf Card across the province.
On Tuesday, Provincial Health Minister, Syed Qasim Ali Shah addressed a press conference regarding the reactivation of free healthcare services under the Health Card Plus initiative for the people of the province.
The Provincial Minister shared that the Health Card initiative began in 2015, initially covering four districts of the province. By 2020, the scheme had expanded to cover the entire province, with an annual expenditure of Rs18 billion. The Health Minister, along with Chief Executive Sehat Sahulat Program, Dr Riaz Tanoli and Program Director Dr Ijaz, provided updates on the ongoing efforts.
Praising the successful implementation of Health Card services in K-P, Minister Shah stated that 1,800 different medical treatments are now available for free in 118 public and private hospitals catering to various specialties across the province. He highlighted that a significant amount of Rs10 million had already been spent on the admission of seven hundred patients by noon on Tuesday.
This reflects a fulfilment of ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan’s vision, which has been rejuvenated, and currently, an average of Rs3 billion is spent monthly on the Health Card.
Furthermore, the Minister announced the reopening of counters for Health Cards at hospitals, with the government allocating an additional Rs5 billion to the insurance company for this purpose.
He revealed that the previous government’s discontinuation of the Health Card during its tenure adversely affected the economically disadvantaged citizens.
The Minister emphasised that the Health Card is not a temporary but a long-term project. Under the leadership of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, K-P province will witness new horizons of development.
The Health Department has issued a list of hospitals available on the Health Card Program’s panel, providing free treatment facilities in 118 hospitals. Minister Shah assured that the current challenges, including over-billing and irregularities, are being addressed by restricting certain operational procedures in government hospitals.
The number of hospitals empaneled on Health Card program has been reduced to less than 180 from over 180.
Minister Shah acknowledged the remaining financial challenges, leaving a balance of Rs18 billion in the system. Despite these challenges, the government is committed to restarting the program for the benefit of the people.
The provincial Assembly has recently approved a one-month budget, and while challenges persist, overcoming them is essential for the well-being of the public.
The minister said that the treatment facilities on the Sehat Card would be further improved in the province in the coming days as it was considered the flag-ship project of the previous PTI government.
The suspension of the treatment on Sehat Card during the caretaker government left almost all MTI hospitals across the province bankrupt and without funds. 
The caretaker government was of the view that due to the financial crisis it could not afford free treatment facilities for all classes of the society in the province. It also decided to allow treatment under the Sehat card in only one government sector hospital in each district and certain treatments were only available at the public sector MTI hospitals.

4,"Potential rift between K-P, federation disastrous for province",K-P is almost entirely dependent on the financial support of the federal government,"In the newly elected Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Peshawar, the province’s also newly elected Chief Minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, was absent, which has raised concerns of a potential rift between the federation and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
In the event that such a rift does materialise, it would put the province, which has a population of more than 40 million, in a severe financial crisis. For instance, as per data collected by The Express Tribune, the federal government owes K-P around Rs 3,000 billion in electricity, gas, and oil royalties. Moreover, it would also jeopardise the province’s national finance commission (NFC) award. In this regard, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz’s (PML-N) K-P Spokesperson, Ikthiar Wali, urged the province’s Chief Minister to overcome political differences with the parties in government in the federation and adopt a policy of reconciliation.

“K-P is almost entirely dependent on the financial support of the federal government. Thus the province cannot afford resistance and opposition to the federation,” said Wali. “The highest net profit on electricity to date was given to the province by the Nawaz Sharif led government. If the Chief Minister sits down with the Prime Minister, things can surely be fixed,” he added. Elaborating upon Wali’s observations, Dr Shaheed Hussain Soherwordi, Chairman of the International Relations Department of the University of Peshawar, said that the province cannot afford to go through another round of resistance with the federation.
“We have already seen the Parvez Khattak government resist the federation and now if the current Chief Minister follows suit, only the people of K-P will suffer,” cautioned Dr Soherwordi. The Chairman of the International Relations Department also advised the government in the centre to recognise the arrears owed to K-P, fulfil the rights of the people of the province, and address their demands, instead of opting for confrontation. While it remains to be seen whether the provincial or federal government will heed to Dr Soherwordi’s advice, in a recent conversation with journalists, Chief Minister Gandapur whilst addressing his absence from Prime Minister Sharif’s visit to Peshawar, said that he was not in Peshawar the day Prime Minister visited.
“It is our tradition to honour guests who come to the province. As far as matters related to the federation are concerned, we will take them up with the federation,” said Gandapur. The Chief Minister further said that for any meaningful conversation to take place between the province and the federation, the government at the centre had to release the Rs 1,500 billion owed to K-P under the NFC award. “We are only demanding what is rightfully owed to people of K-P and the federal government should take our concerns seriously,” the Chief Minister remarked.
