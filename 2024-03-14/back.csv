0,Nawaz’s sons get court relief,"Accountability court cancels permanent warrants, revoke proclamation of Hassan and Hussain"," 
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s sons, Hassan and Hussain, received significant relief on Thursday as an accountability court revoked its earlier order declaring them proclaimed offenders and canceled their permanent arrest warrants.
The court also admitted the plea for their acquittal and directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to present all records of the cases filed against them on Friday (today).
On Thursday, Hassan and Hussain surrendered themselves to Islamabad Accountability Court-I before Judge Nasir Javed Rana. The brothers had returned to Pakistan on March 12 after the same judge suspended their arrest warrants on March 7.
Hassan and Hussain were named as accused along with Nawaz Sharif in all three references—the Avenfield case, the Flagship case, and the Al-Azizia case—filed by NAB in July 2017 on the order of the Supreme Court following the Panama Papers scandal.
As the brothers, who live in the United Kingdom, did not attend the legal proceedings, the courts that heard these cases declared them proclaimed offenders and issued permanent arrest warrants.
Last year, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) acquitted Nawaz Sharif in both the Avenfield and Al-Azizia cases on November 29 and December 12, 2023, respectively. Meanwhile, NAB withdrew its appeal against an accountability court’s verdict to acquit Nawaz in the Flagship reference.
On Thursday, the brothers' lawyer, Qazi Masbah, stated that the court had issued arrest warrants for the accused to ensure their appearance in court.

He said in the Avenfield reference, all other accused— Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, and Captain (Retired) Safdar—had been acquitted, and the IHC had also acquitted Nawaz in the Al-Azizia case.
“Nawaz Sharif was acquitted by the accountability court in the Flagship reference, and NAB has withdrawn its appeal against the trial court’s order,” he said, requesting the court to set aside its earlier order for declaring Hassan and Hussain as proclaimed offenders.
The court, while rescinding the arrest warrants for the brothers, ordered them to submit bonds of Rs50,000 each.  The court also ordered NAB to present the case record by Friday while admitting their requests for acquittal.
The judge also accepted Qazi Misbah’s request to appoint a pleader for the accused and later appointed Rana Irfan as their pleader. In an informal conversation with journalists in the courtroom, Hussain said they never claimed they are not Pakistani citizens.
“Everything that happened to us is in front of you. Hassan Nawaz and I have no affiliation with any government. However, on October 12, 1999, we were arrested from the PM's House without any charges, kept in solitary confinement for 14 months, and then deported without any case against us.”
He noted that significant changes had taken place in NAB.
“More reforms are needed to prevent future political vendettas. Parliament and the government may legislate in reference to NAB if they deem it necessary.”
In response to a question regarding giving the right to a fair trial to PTI founder Imran Khan, he stated that everyone should have the right to a transparent trial. “It is very unfortunate that we could not participate in our mother's funeral,” he added.

1,Inflation casts shadow over Ramazan festivities,Prices of essential kitchen staples skyrocketed by over 200% on the first day of Ramazan,"As Pakistan welcomes the sacred month of Ramazan, households find themselves grappling with a staggering increase in food prices, delivering a harsh blow to their wallets and plunging them into hardship.
On the first day of Ramazan, the prices of essential kitchen staples skyrocketed by over 200%, sending shockwaves through consumers. Capsicum, commonly known as ""shimla mirch,"" shot up to over Rs600/kg in retail markets in Karachi, a drastic jump from its previous price of less than Rs200/kg.
Despite the federal government temporarily halting the export of onions and bananas in an attempt to decelerate and stabilise their prices in the country, the cost of these items continued to climb in domestic markets.
On Tuesday, onion prices surged by up to 100%, reaching Rs250-300/kg, while bananas witnessed a similar surge, reaching Rs200/dozen or more, up from Rs100-150/dozen just a week earlier.
Bananas (average quality) became costlier to Rs200/dozen or more from Rs100-150/dozen about a week ago.
The veal's (meat of young cow) prices up Rs200-300/kg to Rs1,400-1,500/kg on the first day of the holy month of Ramazan from around Rs1,100-1,200/kg.
Prices of other foods surged significantly including melon, watermelon, apple, cabbage, carrot, potato, tomatoes, gram flour, brown chickpea, white chickpea and mutton.
While talking to The Express Tribune, All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters, Importers and Merchants Association (PFVA), Patron-in-Chief, Waheed Ahmed said the markets may observe ease in onion prices over the next couple of days, as traders were still purchasing onion for exports till yesterday (Monday) in Karachi' wholesale market located on super highway.
The Federal Ministry of Commerce issued the notice on Tuesday, temporarily suspending the export of onion and bananas with immediate effect till April 15, 2024.

He, however, claimed onions would see a notable price drop from the next month when the new crop of the commodity would start arriving at domestic markets from Balochistan in April.
He believed that the temporary ban placed on the export of bananas may fail to make any difference in its price, going forward, as a very small quantity of the fruit was being exported to merely Afghanistan and Iran.
The phenomenon of price hikes was largely associated with the short production of the commodity compared to its prevailing demand inside the country.
When confronted with inquiries about the widespread price hikes, Ahmed pointed out that the surge wasn't confined to just the two export items. He noted that for the past 10 to 12 years, he had observed a trend where food prices skyrocketed in the initial week of Ramazan, only to gradually taper off after the first 5 to 6 days of the holy month.
He projected the same trend may prevail this Ramazan as well, estimating the price-hike would reverse to normal levels from next week.
Ahmed emphasised the critical need to investigate why Pakistan transitioned from being a net exporter to a net importer of food items some years ago, exacerbating food insecurity within the country.
The export ban is no solution, but giving birth to problems like rising unemployment in the agriculture sector and in associated supply chain management and reducing the inflow of foreign exchange reserves.
He claimed not a single government has given the required priority and focus to agriculture over the past 30 years. This has resulted in reducing production instead of increasing along with the rising population.
He said climate change is the basic cause of low production of foods in the country. There is a great need to do research and development (R&D) in the agriculture sector to establish climate-friendly and climate-resilient seeds, take surplus production and export them.
This would help create new employment opportunities and earn more foreign exchange reserves.

3,Shehbaz says Chinese modernisation created growth centres,"Pakistan is now ready to move toward the second phase of CPEC, Shehbaz said","Pakistan and China will carry shared values and march toward shared development, prosperity and progress together, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Shehbaz on his election as prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on March 3. In his response, Shehbaz thanked Xi for his warm congratulations and continued support for Pakistan.
""I deeply value his sentiments not only for the people of Pakistan, for our friendship, but our mutual cooperation,"" Shehbaz said during an interview with Xinhua at the Prime Minister's Office in Islamabad. ""For me, it's a very good start.""
This year marks the 73rd anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan. Shehbaz said that over the past 70-plus years, the leaders of Pakistan and China have continuously cultivated and promoted bilateral friendship. The two countries have developed into all-weather strategic cooperative partners with a unique friendship like ""iron brothers"" that has stood the test of time.
""This friendship now must achieve higher heights,"" he added.
Shehbaz, 73, served three terms as chief minister of Punjab province and has extensive experience in regional economic development and governance. When talking about Chinese modernisation, Shehbaz said Pakistan should emulate the model.
""It is a great success model and success story,"" the prime minister said, recalling how generations of visionary Chinese leaders have led their people to create unprecedented development miracles, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and providing vast rural populations with access to education, healthcare and employment.
Shehbaz said Chinese modernisation has created growth centres and sectors competitive in the global market. ""Despite challenges in recent years, China's growth has still gone steadily compared to other countries, which is a remarkable achievement,"" he added.
The prime minister said that Pakistan could learn from the model to alleviate poverty, boost youth employment, and encourage small and medium entrepreneurship in agricultural, industrial, and information technology sectors across urban and rural areas.
Noting that Pakistan is among the first batch of countries joining the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), Shehbaz said that Pakistan fully and firmly supports the GDI and Global Security Initiative. He believes such initiatives will strengthen the bond among global communities.
Noting that projects under the Belt and Road Initiative span across continents, Shehbaz said they contributed to alleviating poverty, reducing hunger, facilitating investment, and promoting education and health.
""There couldn't have been a better model for forging global societies together,"" Shehbaz said.
As a prominent project under the Belt and Road Initiative, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was featured in Shehbaz's first parliamentary speech after re-election.
Pakistan is now ready to move toward the second phase of CPEC, Shehbaz said, aiming to promote technological development and agriculture through the corridor.
Pakistan has established the Special Investment Facilitation Council, which will cut red tape and remove delays and inefficiencies for CPEC projects, Shehbaz said.
The country is also planning to build industrial parks and export zones and looks forward to Chinese joint ventures in sectors such as textile and steel, which combine Chinese technologies with Pakistan's labour assets.
""Through those joint ventures, high-quality products in agriculture, industry, IT, etc., are produced to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and wealth and increase our production and exports,"" he added.
""China has been extremely helpful in promoting Pakistan's economic progress, and CPEC has played a very important role, which we really appreciate deeply,"" said Shehbaz.
The prime minister said that Pakistan is working toward electrifying its transport system to cut import fuel costs and spend the money on development instead. The country also plans to acquire clean energy technologies from China and others.
Shehbaz said that he looks forward to revisiting China, calling it a tradition for Pakistan's new leadership after inauguration. ""China is our second home,"" he said.
""We made solemn commitments that we would work together,"" said Shehbaz, ""and we would be together through thick and thin.""
