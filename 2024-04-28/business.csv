1,K-P to construct Tank Zam Dam,"It would irrigate 100,000 acres of barren land in southern districts","As an important step towards utilizing available water resources in an effective and useful manner, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government has decided to undertake the construction of the Tank Zam Dam project to preserve natural water resources as well as implement the provincial government’s vision to ensure food security in the province.
The decision was taken at a meeting held in Islamabad on Saturday with K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the chair. Besides Additional Chief Secretary for Planning and Development Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah and Irrigation Secretary Tahir Orakzai, high ups of relevant federal and provincial departments attended the meeting.
The meeting discussed in detail different projects of the irrigation sector with a special focus on the construction of the Chashma Right Bank Canal (CRBC) and Tank Zam Dam projects and made important decisions regarding them. The relevant authorities informed participants of the available options to implement the projects.
Briefing the meeting on the salient features of the proposed Tank Zam Dam project, the authorities said the project, once completed, would irrigate about 100,000 acres of barren land in the province’s southern districts in addition to generating 25.5 Megawatts (MW) of hydropower.
The chief minister directed the completion of homework for the implementation of the Tank Zam Dam project, adding that construction of the dam was the need of the hour and that it was of vital importance not only to bring the barren land of the southern districts under cultivation but also to produce cheap electricity and reduce possible flood damage in the region.
Construction of small dams was urgently needed to ensure food security in the province, he remarked, adding that the provincial government would take all possible steps under a well-planned and integrated strategy and that the funds required for such projects would be provided on a priority basis.
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government is set to allocate a substantial Rs20 billion for the pivotal but long-dormant Chashma Right Bank Canal (CRBC) Lift- cum-Gravity project in the upcoming budget.
Recognizing its significance, the allocation underscores the project’s potential to irrigate 286,000 acres of currently barren land which promises a surge in agricultural output and job creation as well as propulsion of the province towards agricultural self-sufficiency.
The crucial meeting at the Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad saw the participation of key officials from both provincial and federal departments.
Deliberations centered on the CRBC project’s implementation, culminating in a unanimous decision to initiate tender proceedings by July, with a directive to ensure the timely completion of all prerequisites.
It was resolved that the project would adhere to previously agreed modalities between federal and provincial authorities, with the federal government shouldering 65% of the total costs, and the remaining 35% to be borne by the provincial government

2,Achakzai gets breather as arrest warrant suspended,Magistrate 9 Quetta provides relief to nationalist politician until May 31,"The arrest warrant issued for the leader of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Mahmood Khan Achakzai, has been suspended by a local court in Quetta.
The court of Magistrate 9 Quetta suspended the arrest warrant for the seasoned politician on an application filed by the President of the Quetta Bar Association, Qari Rehmatullah Advocate, and other lawyers.
The suspension comes as a temporary relief for Achakzai until the next hearing which is scheduled for May 31. The decision to suspend the arrest warrant was made during a court session during which Magistrate 9 deemed it appropriate to withhold the warrant until further proceedings, Naseebullah Kasi, one of the lawyers challenging the arrest warrant for Achakzai, told The Express Tribune.
The move effectively delays any potential legal action against Achakzai until the upcoming hearing. “The court is going to declare this case null and void very soon,” Kasi hoped.
The issuance of the arrest warrant had caused a stir in political circles as Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the chairman of the PkMAP, had faced imminent arrest. Issued by the Judicial Magistrate, it had stuck police to apprehend Achakzai and produce him before the court on April 27.
However, with the order now suspended, the legal battle surrounding Achakzai’s case takes on a new dimension. The decision to suspend the document raises questions about the underlying reasons and potential implications for the ongoing legal proceedings.
As the case unfolds, political circles eagerly await further developments and insights into the legal complexities surrounding Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s situation. The next hearing on May 31 is expected to shed more light on the matter and determine the course of action moving forward.
