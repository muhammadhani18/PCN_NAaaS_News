1,KU faculty pens letter expressing solidarity with US campus protests,Letter expresses 'unwavering' solidarity with ongoing protests against the persistent human rights violations in Gaza,"Over two hundred professors, including several deans and senior academics from the University of Karachi, alongside the president of the Karachi University Teachers Society, penned a letter to professors and students of various universities in the United States, expressing solidarity with ongoing campus protests against atrocities in Gaza on Sunday.
The letter expressed 'unwavering' solidarity with the ongoing protests against the persistent human rights violations in Gaza.
This gesture also criticised policies on US campuses and of the government, while reaffirming the paramount significance of academic freedom.


The message from the faculty members of KU is addressed to more than 40 universities, notably Columbia University in New York, New York University, the University of Texas in Austin, Yale University, the University of Southern California, Emory University in Atlanta, Ohio University, George Washington University, Indiana University, and Arizona State University.

The letter also strongly condemned Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide against Palestinians.
It also condemned the atrocities perpetrated by Israel and decried the provision of arms by various governments enabling such violence.
The letter underscored the collective resolve of Karachi's academic community to stand in solidarity with their American counterparts in the struggle for academic freedom.
It also pledged continued advocacy for a peaceful global landscape and the liberation of Palestine.
Since April 24, protests against Israel filled streets in Brooklyn and escalated at universities across the United States as demonstrators demanded an end to civilian casualties in Gaza.
School leaders at several universities have responded in the past week by asking police to clear out camps and arrest those who refuse to leave.

2,Dar elevated to deputy PM,Move may allow FM to oversee economy too,"Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was elevated to the position of deputy prime minister on Sunday, a surprise move that could give a close and trusted aide of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif powers to also oversee the economic policies.
The announcement was made by the Prime Minister’s Office and the Foreign Office at a time when both Prime Minister Shehbaz and Foreign Minister Dar were in Saudi Arabia to attend the special meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
“The Prime Minister has been pleased to designate Mr. Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Deputy Prime Minister with immediate effect and until further orders,” read the notification form the Cabinet Division.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, stated that the “Prime Minister has given approval for appointing Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar as the Deputy Prime Minister just a little while ago”.

There was no explanation as to what prompted the Shehbaz to elevate Dar and that too on Sunday when he was not even in Pakistan. Dar would remain the foreign minister, while performing the role of Shehbaz deputy, as per the notification issued by the government.
Dar is the fourth deputy prime minister in Pakistan’s history. Last time Parvez Elahi served as deputy prime minister in 2012 during the then Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government. At the time Elahi’s PML-Quaid-e-Azam was a coalition partner of the PPP and his appointment was symbolic and part of power-sharing deal. However, Elahi held no powers.
There is no mention of the post of deputy prime minister in the Constitution. And there is no clarity either about the powers Dar may exercise as deputy prime minister. Some observers believe that Dar has been given this additional charge to address his grievances about being overlooked for the post of finance minister.
Dar had always been the first choice of the PML-N for the finance minister. However, after the February 8 elections, the coveted post was given to Muhammad Aurangzeb, a former banker. It is believed that Dar never liked the decision though he was compensated after being appointed as the foreign minister.
Sources said Dar as foreign minister still kept a close watch on the activities in the Finance ministry. Some officials from the finance ministry and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) kept seeing him at the Foreign Office, indicating keen interest of Dar in financial matters.

There was no explanation given by the government regarding the surprise decision. But some people saw the development as an indication of increased role of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in government affairs.
Some quarters expressed the fear that the move might trigger a potential power struggle within the government. They feared that Dar’s elevation could not only undermine the role of finance minister but also Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Dar severed as finance minister during the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government after the ouster of former prime minister Imran Khan. There was talk among some close PML-N circles that Dar often bypassed Shehbaz and took direct orders from Nawaz.
That was the reason Shehbaz never wanted Dar to be appointed as finance minister in his cabinet after the February 8 elections. Shehbaz might have succeeded in his effort but Dar’s new role could jeopardise his authority.
However, others believe that Dar’s role would be ceremonial as powers that be would never let him interfere in the finance ministry’s matter. “This was just a symbolic move,” said one source. “Even if Aurangzeb fails there is no chance Dar would return as finance minister,” the source added.

4,France's foreign minister looks to prevent Israel-Hezbollah conflict escalation in Lebanon visit,French FM warns Israeli threats of military operation in southern Lebanon to be taken seriously,"France's foreign minister will push proposals to prevent further escalation and a potential war between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah during a visit to Lebanon on Sunday as Paris seeks to refine a roadmap that both sides could accept to ease tensions.
France has historical ties with Lebanon and earlier this year Stephane Sejourne delivered an initiative that proposed Hezbollah's elite unit pull back 10 km (6 miles) from the Israeli border, while Israel would halt strikes in southern Lebanon.
The two have exchanged tit-for-tat strikes in recent months, but the exchanges have increased since Iran launched a barrage of missiles on Israel in response to a suspected Israeli attack on the Iranian embassy in the Syrian capital Damascus that killed members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas Quds Force.
France's proposal, which has been discussed with partners, notably the United States, has not moved forward, but Paris wants to keep momentum in talks and underscore to Lebanese officials that Israeli threats of a military operation in southern Lebanon should be taken seriously.
Hezbollah has maintained it will not enter any concrete discussion until there is a ceasefire in Gaza, where the war between Israel and Islamist militant group Hamas has entered its sixth month.
Israel has also said it wants to ensure calm is restored on its northern border so that thousands of displaced Israelis can return to the area without fear of rocket attacks from across the border.
""The objective is to prevent a regional conflagration and avoid that the situation deteriorates even more on the border between Israel and Lebanon,"" foreign ministry deputy spokesperson Christophe Lemoine said at a news conference.
Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Nikati and Lebanese army chief Joseph Aoun met French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this month, where they discussed the French proposal.
In a letter addressed to the French embassy in Beirut in March, Lebanon's foreign ministry said Beirut believed the French initiative would be a significant step towards peace and security in Lebanon and the broader region.
Local Lebanese media had reported the government had provided feedback to the French on the proposal.
French officials say the responses so far have been general and lack consensus among the Lebanese. While they deem it too early for any form of accord, they believe it is vital to engage now so that when the moment comes both sides are ready.
Paris will also underline the urgency of breaking the political deadlock in the country. Lebanon has neither a head of state nor a fully empowered cabinet since Michel Aoun's term as president ended in October 2022.
Israel has remained cautious on the French initiative, although Israeli and French officials say Israel supports efforts to defuse the cross-border tensions.
""The flames will flicker and tensions will continue,"" said a Lebanese diplomat. ""We are in a situation of strategic ambiguity on both sides.""
France has 700 troops based in southern Lebanon as part of the 10,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force.
Officials say the U.N. troops are unable to carry out their mandate and part of France's proposals are aimed at beefing up the mission by strengthening the Lebanese army.
After Lebanon, Sejourne will head to Saudi Arabia before traveling to Israel.
Arab and Western foreign ministers, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, will hold informal talks on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum event in Riyadh to discuss the Gaza war with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

5,"Portugal's government rejects paying reparations for colonial, slavery legacy","Sousa proposes methods to pay reparations, says country could cancel the debt of former colonies, provide financing","Portugal's government said on Saturday it refuses to initiate any process to pay reparations for atrocities committed during transatlantic slavery and the colonial era, contrary to earlier comments from President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.
From the 15 to the 19 century,six million Africans were kidnapped and forcibly transported across the Atlantic by Portuguese vessels and sold into slavery, primarily in Brazil.
Rebelo de Sousa had said on Saturday Portugal could use several methods to pay reparations, such as cancelling the debt of former colonies and providing financing.
The government said in a statement sent to the Portuguese news agency Lusa it wants to ""deepen mutual relations, respect for historical truth and increasingly intense and close cooperation, based on the reconciliation of brotherly peoples"".
But it added it had ""no process or program of specific actions"" for paying reparations, noting this line was followed by previous governments.
It called relations with former colonies ""truly excellent"" and cited cooperation in areas such as education, language, culture, and health, in addition to financial, budgetary and economic cooperation.
On Tuesday, the president suggested a need for reparations, sparking strong criticism from right-wing parties, including the junior partner of the Democratic Alliance government coalition, CDS-Popular Party, and the far-right Chega.
""We cannot put this under the carpet or in a drawer. We have an obligation to pilot, to lead this process (of reparations)"", the president told reporters on Saturday.
Portugal's colonial era lasted more than five centuries, with Angola, Mozambique, Brazil, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, East Timor and some territories in Asia subject to Portuguese rule.
Decolonisation of the African countries and the end of empire in Africa only happened months after Portugal's ""Carnation Revolution"" on April 25, 1974, toppled the longest fascist dictatorship in Europe and ushered in democracy.

6,Police arrest scores of pro-Palestinian protesters on US university campuses,Over 100 protesters arrested at Columbia University inspire nationwide campus,"Pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on a handful of US university campuses on Saturday, as activists vowed to keep up the movement seeking a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas among other demands.
The Indiana University police department in Bloomington said in an emailed statement that 23 protesters were arrested there.
Indiana State Police along with Indiana University police told demonstrators they could not pitch tents and camp on campus. When the tents were not removed, police arrested and transported protesters to the Monroe County Justice Center on charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest.
""The Indiana University Police Department continues to support peaceful protests on campus that follow university policy,"" the police statement read.
Pro-Palestinian protests have spread to college campuses across the US, stoked by the mass arrest of over 100 people on Columbia University's campus last week.
In addition to a ceasefire, protesters are demanding that their schools divest from companies involved with Israel's military and seeking an end to US military assistance for Israel along with amnesty for students and faculty members who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.
School leaders at several universities have responded in the past week by asking police to clear out camps and arrest those who refuse to leave. While saying they defend free speech rights to protest, the leaders say they will not abide activists infringing on campus policies against hate speech or camping out on university grounds.
Massachusetts State Police said in statement that they helped clear out a protest encampment at Northeastern University in Boston and that 102 protesters who refused to leave were arrested and will be charged with trespassing.
Northeastern University said in a statement on social media that it decided to call in police as ""what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organizers with no affiliation to Northeastern.""
At  Arizona State University, campus police arrested 69 protesters early Saturday, the school said in a statement.
The university said ""a group of people – most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff – created an encampment and demonstration"" and were arrested and charged with criminal trespass after refusing to disperse.

8,Riding the Spanish wave,"This Spanish gem, led by the seasoned Jose Coronado, weaves a tale of love, crime, and redemption in heart of Madrid","Ever since I watched Griselda on Netflix, the bot has been storming me with Mexican/Spanish offerings, which I confess, I find quite addictive. As a resultant, I am going through a Hispanic phase, listening to Sr Ortegon, eating omelets, fajitas, burritos and quesadillas as I don’t have the stomach for blood sausage, and tripe. 
However, there are more reasons than one for me to enjoy this steady influx of Spanish content on Netflix. These TV shows and movies often explore universal themes and emotions, making them relatable to a wide audience. Since most of Latin America is as third world as Pakistan, the issues are majorly relatable and create a sense of familiarity and shared experience. Plus, it’s a whole different galaxy of stars, as the actors are refreshing, dynamite and different from the Hollywood collection that we are all familiar with. 
It seems that shows coming in from non-English speaking countries are breaking the decades old Hollywood hegemony. As far as I know, it began with Money Heist [originally Casa De Papel] in 2017, then 2021 saw the global success of The Squid Game, followed by Lupin, All of Us Are Dead, Elite, Berlin, Wrong Side of the Tracks and many more. 
With a straightforward plan for international success, Netflix invests a lot of money in local creators to make high-quality shows that cater to specific countries. While many of these shows may not become huge global hits, they serve as content that attracts and retains subscribers in local markets. Some of these localised productions end up becoming popular worldwide, turning into successful franchises, thanks to Netflix's global platform. This strategy in place since at least 2018, has proven to be quite successful for Netflix.
The latest Spanish show that has become an obsession [at least for me as I hungrily lap up season 3] is Wrong Side of the Tracks, which quickly stormed its way through the top ten trending shows chart. But it is agonising to write about this series without indulging in spoilers.
Mostly shot in the neighbourhoods of Plaza de San Andres and Villaverde Alto, the crime drama series is set in Entrevias, a working-class neighbourhood, located on the wrong side of the railway tracks [featured often in the series] in the south-east of Madrid, in the district of Puente de Vallecas, Spain.
Tirso Abantos is the lead character played by the 66-year-old Jose Coronado, who to me is the Spanish equivalent of Jack Nicholson. Coronado plays a bad-tempered, greying war-hero, frustrated with the rampant crime and delinquency in his neighbourhood. As if he hasn’t had his fill in Bosnia, he wants to play soldier for the rest of his life. This daredevil couldn’t be more up-front, hotheaded, arrogant, stubborn, grouchy and racist. On the plus, he is broody, caring, sensitive and a handsome grandfather. All this minus the psychotic streak that Nicholson conjures. Tirso also has post-traumatic stress disorder, hence freezes up at the slightest hint of love and sentiment, and has a hard time controlling his temper. Through the season, the role sheds layers as Tirso moves through the rapid developments in his life. Mr. Bachan, across the border, would be tempted to sell his Rolls Royce Phantom for this role.
The series opens with a scene where Tirso who is sleeping in his apartment is woken up earlier than normal when he hears an argument and a gunshot from the street outside. He calls the emergency line thrice, explains that he knows a gunshot when he hears it as he served in Bosnia. No one arrives to inspect or check what is going on. In this short scene, Coronado has done what only an actor of his calibre can do, totally hook you, and instantly book you for a binge. 
The next day when he is working at his store, a bunch of young guys who ignored him yelling at them to stop the blaring music from their car stereo, get a taste of his vile temper. He bashes their car up with his car and later arrives at his surprise birthday party, his family has thrown for him. 
Tirso’s wife has left him for another man, but he permanently lives with a frown. He owns a small hardware store and hangs out with two of his men from the Bosnian war — a café owner Pepe and another veteran called Sanchis who suffers post-traumatic stress, stammers, and uses drugs off and on but his besties keep in line. They love him for the package he is. “Well, look relaxed, we are supposed to be having a good time,” says Tirso to Pepe as they walk into a club. “You look like you are going to see the urologist.’” 
Led by Tirso, the adorable trio decides to rid the seedy neighbourhood of junkies, gangsters and young thugs who work for the bigger drug mafia. 
A twist comes into Tirso’s grumpy life when Irene [Nona Sobo, a Spanish actress and model], his adopted teenage Vietnamese granddaughter, is sent to live with him by her parents who are in the process of getting a divorce.
Irene is a right pain in the gluteus maximus. She is in Bollywood-type love with a teenager called Nelson (Felipe Londoño), who is involved with other teenage punks who are up to no good. Things get worse when drug dealers rape Irene, and to survive the trauma, she gets hooked on oxycodone. If that isn’t enough, she also gets pregnant and declares she wants to have the baby. 
Entrevias in Madrid is a bit like Lyari in Karachi. Crime everywhere and the corrupt cops weak against the drug lords. To add more seasoning, there is another character pivotal to the plot and till the very end, it is difficult to understand whether he is a protagonist or not as he seems to be working on both sides of the law. This is a senior cop named Ezequiel played flawlessly by Luis Zahera. 
Tirso and Ezequiel mostly antagonise each other on the crime-fighting track where Tirso finds Ezequiel dubious and untrustworthy. However, their best and most explosive chemistry is as archrivals in regard to Gladys, Nelson’s Columbian mother, who brings a bit of romance in Tristo’s wry life. The only thing unsexy about Gladys, played by Cuban actress Laura Ramos, is her name. 
Ezequiel loves Gladys, and proposes to her a million times, but she is too busy struggling with her life as a cleaner, her delinquent son, and her cranky neighbour Tirso, who her heart skips a beat for. 
There is seething chemistry between Tirso and Gladys as they slowly progress in their weirdest relationship from hating each other’s face, to not speaking to and banging doors at each other or fighting verbal battles, most of which comes from Tirso’s side, even when Gladys softens down. 
The plot is taut and the lines are human, dramatic, quirky, funny and crisp, especially for Tirso, and you cannot LOL at his cynical approach towards everyone, evident from his carefully chosen caustic words to express his disgust and anger at almost everything he confronts. 
Apart from the unlimited violence, suspense, action, and a fantastic pulsatile pace that keep you hooked, the series has a fabulous sound track with a variety of the most beautiful and intense music and songs such as Salsa En La Calle by Norbert Galouo & Jose Ortegon Tovar & Pana Black, Se Me Olvido Que Me Querias by Loreley, Mi Vida Cambio by Bengochea, Malito by Nano, Carros y Neones by Hensy Black, Dropyi, Mueka & Dariel, Santana by Dukus and many more, cleverly placed to accentuate the drama at various points in the series.
Created by David Bermejo, who previously gave the hit series Unauthorised Living, also with both Coronado and Zahera, whom he then plucked for Wrong Side of The Tracks. Bermejo tightly packs each episode so that it is happening and hypnotic despite the long run times. You won’t feel that the first episode is 80 minutes long! 
The pulpy subject of the series has multiple layers, from the drug world to the police circuit, the characters swarming from the street, and the Abantos family which Tirso heads, with gritty and frail relationships. These characters are genuine and appear strangely familiar because of relatable situations and nuances. 
The series does spend a lot of time focusing on the love-hate relationship between Tirso Abantos and his granddaughter. It is intriguing, yet touching to see how the grouchy war vet warms up to her, sacrifices a great deal for her, and even risks his life for her. Irene also transforms from a spoilt, bratty, troublesome teenager to a young woman who begins to see life for all its hard realities. “You can have all the popcorn, you like, but this is not a film in the theatre, this is real life,” says Tirso Abantos to Irene. 
More than anything other feature of the series, it is Tirso’s battle against the crime and drug infestation in his neighbourhood that is very relatable. Not that I am going to run out with a little gun tomorrow to take care of my problems or that of my neighbourhood in Karachi. But I can understand how Tirso feels that he belongs to Entrevias, and he doesn’t like the way it is deteriorating at the hands of people who have vested interest. I live in a city where I born in and I have seen it at its prime. Then followed the decades where the decay set in and my city has changed, in only few ways for the better, but in many more ways, it has become worse. Every government promises progress, and then breaks the promises. All I see around me is corruption, neglect, crime, a confused society and strange people moving like robots to make a living, however crooked or twisted that may be. I totally comprehend where Tirso’s anger comes from.
In 2022, Mediaset España, the co-producing company and its free-to-air Spanish television channel Telecinco, decided to roll out season 1 and 2 of Wrong Side of the Tracks in a row. It was a humongous success. In May 2022, the finale was aired which drew an audience of near 1.9 million viewers in prime time. Netflix has recently added the third season, the first episode of which was pre-screened at the Cádiz-based South International Series Festival in October 2023. The fourth will be the final season, keyed up until then.
