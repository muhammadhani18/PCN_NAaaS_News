Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that area people caught two suspects within the remit of the Bilal Colony police station, gave them a severe beating and were about to set them on fire when a police team arrived at the scene and saved them from the wrath of the mob. 
He said that the wounded suspects were shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for treatment, where they were identified as Abdullah and Shahzeb. 
Two pistols and one snatched motorcycle were recovered from their custody. 
Shahzeb had a past criminal record as he was arrested by the Iqbal Market police earlier. 
The SSP said that a legal action would also be taken against those who tried to kill the suspects.
Suspect held
Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested a suspected mugger who had shot dead a shopkeeper in North Nazimabad recently.
The SSP-Central said that Ghulam Mohammed, 60, was gunned down within the remit of the Shahrah-i-Noor Jehan police station on April 25. Initially, the family had claimed that he was gunned down by robbers. However, the police investigated the case and found that Usman alias Patakha killed the victim over a minor dispute.
The police arrested him and recovered a .30-bore pistol used in the murder.
Meanwhile, four robbers barged into a house in the Defence area and walked off with Rs1.1 million on Saturday, according to APP.

1,SC order to remove encroachments in Karachi reignites fear of mass displacement,Victims of earlier drives accuse municipal staff of taking bribes to return seized goods; lawyer says people's sufferings must be taken into account.,"• Victims of earlier drives accuse municipal staff of taking bribes to return their seized goods
• Authorities must take sufferings of ordinary people into account before taking ‘reckless decision’, opines lawyer
KARACHI: While the Supreme Court has ordered the authorities to remove within three days encroachments from all roads and footpaths, people feared that civic authorities would again allegedly misuse the apex court’s directives to uproot thousands of people earning their livelihoods in and around hundreds of small and big markets in the city without giving them sufficient time and compensation.
Back in 2018, a massive anti-encroachment drive was carried out in the city on the directives of the Supreme Court under which small carts and stalls were removed from different roads and streets, but till date, most affectees had not been given any compensation.
 
 

The authorities did not return seized goods to a large number of vendors. Many alleged that the municipal staff concerned and police returned their seized pushcarts and valuables after taking bribes.
Thousands of families have been rendered homeless following a demolition drive along three major stormwater drains in the city and they have been running from pillar to post for years to get promised compensation but in vain.
While the apex court’s recent order is widely hailed in terms of encroachments that have been occupying spaces meant to be used by the public, it doesn’t sit right with vendors.
“My husband Ghulam used to put a stall of samosas outside Empress Market. Last time when an anti-encroachment drive took place, police seized his cart without any prior notice,” Sakina Wali, 43, a housemaid, told Dawn.
“We had to literally beg them to return it back to us. My husband was abused and humiliated by the staff concerned, and we had to pay them a hefty amount of Rs20,000 to get our cart back,” she said.
She claimed that her husband had a permit to conduct business on the street.
Kausar Bibi, who used to put a stall of spices outside the same Empress Market had a similar story. She is the sole breadwinner of a family of six, that includes four children, and she never returned to the market, instead she started her business outside Meena Bazaar, Karimabad.
“I am scared because I don’t think I can afford to shift again to somewhere else. If they can come for us once, they won’t shy away from putting it all to waste again,” she said, tinge of fear evident in her voice.
Lawyer and human rights activist Abira Ashfaq provided insight on the situation, emphasising that the government must adhere to legal procedures regarding encroachments.
She stressed the importance of examining the necessity for the space by authorities and highlighted the need for a sufficient notice period for individuals using the land to relocate, along with financial assistance provided by the government.
“There are international guidelines about illegal land occupations. Instead of making irrational ‘reckless’ decisions, the authorities must take the sufferings of common people into account and understand that whether an occupation is legal or illegal, it requires a procedure and a notice period and financial compensation should be provided,” Ms Ashfaq said.
Welcoming the decision to remove barricades, lawyer and rights activist Jibran Nasir voiced apprehension that the SC directive may cause confusion among small business owners on the streets.
Also on Saturday, a three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa issued its written order, directing the federal and all provincial governments to clear public roads and pavements of all encroachments within three days.
“Pavements are for the use of the public; access thereto and use thereof cannot be prevented or restricted. Everyone, including the provincial and Federal governments, and all those under them must abide by the law and cannot encroach upon public roads and pavements nor can block them which may stop or restrict public use thereof”, the order said, and added: “Citizens must not be inconvenienced. Those paid out of the public exchequer serve the people, and not vice versa. The misplaced exceptionalism negates the Constitution and the rule of law.”

2,Many city areas to face water shortage for two days,"KARACHI: While the demand of water has increased greatly in the sweltering weather, the water crisis is going to...","KARACHI: While the demand of water has increased greatly in the sweltering weather, the water crisis is going to escalate in the next two days in the city as the supply will remain suspended from the Dhabeji Pumping Station, it emerged on Saturday.
Officials said that the reason for suspension of water supply from the key facility was a planned partial electricity shutdown by the K-Electric due to annual maintenance work.
The water supply would be affected till Tuesday in parts of districts East, South and Central.
However, parts of districts West and Keamari would not be affected due to the suspension of water from Dhabeji Pumping Station as they get water from the Hub dam.
The Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation, the lone water utility, supplies around 600 million gallons per day (MGD) against a demand of over 1,200 MGD and further short supply is bound to pile miseries on the people in most parts of the city.
A KWSC spokesman said that the power supply to various feeders of the Dhabeji Pumping Station would be partially suspended from 11am to 7pm on April 29 and 30 due to annual maintenance work.
He said that the city would face a total shortage of 165 MGD due to the maintenance work by the KE.
The water supply would be temporarily suspended in Jamshed Town, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Clifton, Lyari, Saddar, Liaquatabad and Nazimabad.
The spokesman advised the residents of the affected areas to store water and use it carefully and economically to avoid any problem in their routine.

3,Govt told to receive claims of unregistered families rendered homeless in demolition drives,SC issues written order in nullahs victims rehabilitation case,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court has directed the provincial government and local administration to consider and decide within one month the claims of families who have been rendered homeless and not registered yet for compensation and rehabilitation after the demolition drive was carried out along three major drains in the city.   
The court issued the order after the victims’ counsel had informed the judges that government officials concerned were not ready even to receive their applications/claims.   
As there are various complaints over non-registration of many affected families for compensation and rehabilitation by the authorities concerned, the apex court said that if any affected family had not been included yet, they might submit their claims to an additional commissioner of Karachi.   
A three-judge bench of apex court headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa said that such claims must be filed within a month and the official concerned would have to inform such families whether their claims were accepted or not.   

SC issues written order in nullahs victims rehabilitation case

It also ordered that once this exercise was completed the Sindh government should allot plots and pay compensation to the affected families without further delay.   
The Supreme Court heard several cases related to encroachments on public spaces in the city on April 25 and the written order was released on Saturday.   
At the outset of the hearing, a lawyer for some of the families submitted that houses of his clients had also been demolished, but their names were not included in the list of affected families maintained by the government for compensation and rehabilitation.   
The counsel asserted that the families had been approaching the deputy commissioner office concerned as well as the commissioner of Karachi office, but the officials concerned were not ready even to receive their applications/claims.   
When the bench inquired from the advocate general of Sindh, he submitted that besides providing financial support on account of rental support, the provincial government stood by its commitment to allot 80 square yard plots to the affected families as well as to provide construction cost while 6,932 affected families had been identified.   
Responding to another question of the bench, he said that leases were granted to such families by the departments concerned.   
The provincial law officer further said that on April 8, an identical application seeking registration of affected families also came up for hearing, but it was erroneously mentioned in the last court order that such families may approach the focal person of the chief secretary of Sindh for redressal of their grievances instead of focal person of the commissioner of Karachi, who has been dealing with such cases since long.   
The bench in its order said, “However, if any family whose house was demolished has not been included may submit their claim, with supporting documents and photographs, if any, to the commissioner’s focal person, Ms. Zunaira Jalil, additional commissioner-II, Karachi”.   
It also stated that since the matter needed to be finalised, all such claims should be filed within one month and those who submit claims must be informed of the decision whether their claims were accepted or rejected.   
Rs1m for each house 
The AG said that the amount for construction purpose was fixed at Rs1 million for each house by the Sindh government which was sufficient compensation, but since it was objected to by some of the affectees the matter was referred to the Pakistan Engineering Council to calculate what would be appropriate amount, and the PEC’s calculation was awaited.   
The apex court noted that last order passed on April 8, by this court stipulated compliance be made within two months on subject matter and such period had not expired as yet.   
“Once the above exercise is completed the government should allot plots and pay compensation to the affectees immediately, and maintain proper record, without the need for an order from this court”, it added.   
The demolition drive was carried out on the orders of the Supreme Court along Gujjar, Mehmoodabad and Orangi Town nullahs of the city in order to expand the drains.   
In 2021 the apex court ordered the provincial authorities for compensation and rehabilitation of the affected and displaced families.   
Thereafter, in August last year during the hearing of an application seeking contempt proceedings against Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah for not complying with the orders of the apex court, the provincial authorities forwarded proposals that the government would release amount to each of the affected families for purchase of land and construction according to market value of the land from where the affected families were dispossessed while about the cost of construction, the standards laid down by the PEC for construction of house measuring 80 square yards, would be followed.   
A large number of the affected people, including women, are used to gather and stage protests outside the apex court building on almost every hearing against the government for failing to rehabilitate them despite the passage of around three years and several of them have also been complaining that their homes were also demolished, but they have yet to get any compensation on account of rental support or accommodation despite approaching the officials concerned.

5,"Polio risk high in 34 areas of Karachi, CM Murad told","Anti-polio campaign to begin tomorrow; over 38,000 cases of refusal reported in February.","KARACH: Forty-three areas in 11 districts, including 34 in Karachi division alone, are at a high polio risk whereas more than 38,000 cases of refusals were reported in the province during the national immunisation days observed in February this year.
This was shared during a meeting of the provincial task force for the eradication of polio held at the CM House on Saturday.
The meeting, presided over by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, was organised to discuss the challenges in the upcoming national immunisation campaign scheduled for Monday (April 29) in 25 districts.
 






Briefing on the latest polio situation in the country, Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said that two polio cases had been detected this year in Balochistan; one in Dera Bugti and the other in Chaman district.

Anti-polio campaign to begin tomorrow;  over 38,000 cases of refusal reported in February

In Sindh, she said, environmental samples had been collected from all the districts and 43 areas of 11 districts were found to have poliovirus in their sewage.
These included 13 areas of Karachi East, three each of Central, Malir and Korangi, Hyderabad and Sukkur, six each of South and Keamari, and one each in Jamshoro, Jacobabad and Badin.
The chief minister was informed that a total of 38,743 cases of refusal were reported during the national immunisation days observed in February this year.
 
 

The meeting was informed that over 9.04 million children under the age of five were given polio vaccine at transit points over the last 15 months, starting from Jan 2023 to March 2024.
“A total of 275 transit posts were set up with 1.003 teams across Sindh. The department has also launched the Polio Ambassador Unitive Project in Karachi that is now being expanded across the province with 407 schools participating and 901 new Polio Ambassadors inducted this month,” she said, adding that Polio Ambassadors were advocating for the cause of vaccination in their homes, communities and schools.
Over 0.6m workers to participate in drive
The chief minister was informed that the National Immunisation Campaign would be launched on Monday in 25 districts of the province, during which 8m children below 5 years of age would receive oral polio vaccine (OPV).
Over 600,000 frontline workers would participate in the drive. The anti-polio drive would be carried out in 201 union councils of Karachi in which 24,656 polio workers would perform their duties.
“Eradication of polio is a collective responsibility. Therefore, the district administration, local bodies, civil society members and our partners must work together to save children from the crippling disease. All deputy commissioners and SSPs must ensure its success,” the chief minister said during the meeting.
It was decided that the health department would share the list of the poliovirus-infected union councils with local bodies/towns and the district administrations to ensure proper cleanliness, efficient disposal of wastewater and provision of clean drinking water.
Mr Shah directed the staff to ensure that no parent was allowed to refuse administration of polio drops to his/her children and report the case to the administration for action.

6,Call for greater inclusivity of minorities in society,"KARACHI: With an aim to explore strategies to enhance inclusivity, a diverse group of individuals, representing...","KARACHI: With an aim to explore strategies to enhance inclusivity, a diverse group of individuals, representing various faiths, aired their views regarding their representation in the media at a programme organised by the Karachi Chapter of the Pakistan-US Alumni Network (PUAN) with support of the US Mission in Pakistan held at the Holy Trinity Cathedral here on Saturday.
The programme was divided into two parts. The first part had individual speeches and the second a panel discussion. While speaking on the occasion, chairman of the Pakistan Khalsa Sikh Council, Sardar Amar Singh said that the media did not cover real issues faced by minorities. “Just covering our festivals is not enough. What about what lies beneath the surface?” He asked, while pointing out the missed stories about forced conversions, bandits in Ghotki and attacks on religious places of minorities.
Representing the Parsi community and member of CM Sindh’s Non-Muslim Welfare Committee Tushna Patel said that everyone deserves equal opportunity.
“Pakistan has various faiths. Stereotyping and biases can fuel societal divides. By amplifying our voices, you can build bridges and develop a better understanding about our faiths while creating empathy, understanding and open-mindedness to create a just and inclusive world,” she said.
MPA Rooma Mushtaq, an advocate and another member of the CM Sindh’s Non-Muslim Welfare Committee, said that she could assure the PPP government’s support to minority religious groups.
MNA Kheal Das Kohistani, representing the Hindu community, said that he was a Pakistani first. “So don’t call me a ‘minority’, don’t bracket me because I also experience the same issues you do such as electricity loadshedding and water scarcity,” he said while also lamenting that there was no non-Muslim governor or president in Pakistan.
He also said that when prime minister of India Narendra Modi says anything targeting Muslims in his country, it has nothing to do with the Hindus in Pakistan. “Please don’t blame us or make us suffer due to Modi’s actions,” he said.
Former Federal Minister for Law and Justice Barrister Shahida Jamil recalled the Quaid-i-Azam’s August 11, 1947 speech to the first Constituent Assembly where he had said to all religious minorities that they were free to go to their temples. “Muslims were looked down upon and discriminated against before partition, which led to the two-nation theory. Pakistan was to be a land where there was to be no discrimination,” she said.
The Bishop of Karachi and Balochistan Diocese, Church of Pakistan, Rt Rev Fredrick John, said that medium was important. “Most important is the medium of conversation to point out issues but pointing them out in the right way is also important. Many times I object to using the word ‘minority’. Words such as ‘minority’, ‘majority’, ‘intolerance’ and ‘tolerance’ create complexes. Such words must be avoided,” he said.
During the panel discussion, which followed, moderator Sadiya Samson asked her panellists different questions relating to the theme of diversity and issues of minorities.
President of Pakistan Young Hindu Forum, Advocate Mukesh Kumar Karara said that the media misinterpreted forced conversion cases by making it look like the girl willingly came to court to convert to Islam.
“There are a lot of crucial things that need to be highlighted but the media shows what the majority wants to see. And why don’t Hindu boys want to convert? Why just our girls?” He pointed out.
Founding Member, Minority Rights March, Sijal Shafique said that there were also other religious minorities in Pakistan but somehow the media here only focused on Christians and Hindus.
Another founding member of the Minority Rights March, Bhevish Kumar said that in Pakistan there was a holiday for Christians on Christmas only because it also happens to be the birthday of the Father of the Nation.
Deep Kiran Rajani, another minority group member, who is Senior Deputy Director of Human Resources with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, narrated an incident her little daughter faced in school sometime back. “We feel that we are Pakistanis as we were born here. We want to think for and work for Pakistan but sometimes this positivity is hurt by a negative attitude or person,” she said. “When my daughter was in class one, a classmate told her friends not to talk to her because she was not Muslim,” she shared.
Writer and content creator Shehzad Ghias Shaikh said that exclusion was built in Pakistani society. “We tell our children that this country was created because of the two-nation theory, because we could not live with Hindus, who looked down on us and treated us like untouchables. Then we tell our children to make friends with their Hindu class fellows,” he said. “The ideas that most people have been raised on need to be challenged,” he concluded.

8,Multi-party rally in Hyderabad calls for probe into supply of Nato weapons to dacoit gangs,Bilawal urged to answer his own question about source of such supplies; feudal lords associated with PPP accused of patronising gangs.,"HYDERABAD: Activists of many nationalist and progressive parties on Saturday brought out a ‘peace rally’ over deteriorating law and order situation and increasing incidents of kidnapping for ransom in Sindh, as well as failure of security agencies in tracing out Priya Kumari and taking to task killers of journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar and other respectable citizens.
The rally started from the Old Campus locality and culminated outside the local press club.
The participating parties included Awami Tehreek (AT), Awami Workers Party (AWP), Sindh United Party (SUP), Awami Jamhoori Party (AJP), National Party (NP), Watan Dost Jamhoori Party (WDJP) and Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP).
The rally passed through Risala Road and Hyder Chowk before reaching its culminating point.
The participants were carrying flags of their respective parties and placards and banners inscribed with slogans against lawlessness. They raised slogans against ‘dacoit Raj’ on Sindh and kidnapping for ransom, which they lamented, had become order of the day in upper Sindh districts.

Bilawal urged to answer his own question about source of such supplies; feudal lords associated with PPP accused of patronising gangs

AT president Lal Jarwar condemned Sindh government for “handing over Sindh to dacoits”. He claimed that influential feudal lords and tribal heads associated with the PPP were patronising dacoit gangs, which were kidnapping people and collecting ransom money to the tune of millions of rupees.
AJP leader Syed Lal Shah alleged that after handing over Sindh to dacoits, Sindh’s resources, including its lands, were being usurped. He recalled that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had recently raised the question that “who is providing Nato’s sophisticated weapons to dacoits?” Mr Shah said people wanted answer to this question from Bilawal himself. He noted that this type of lawlessness had poisoned life of people in Sindh.
NP’s Sindh President Taj Marri said that dacoits had created ‘a state within a state’ and were challenging writ of the state. Despite this lawlessness, no effective operation was being launched against outlaws, he wondered, and claimed that waderas, jagirdars and administration were colluding with each other to let dacoits establish and perpetuate their rule.
AWP leader Latif Leghari told the protesters that the situation where outlaws were using Nato weapons warranted a forceful operation against them. Besides, he added, an investigation should be conducted to ascertain source of such weapon supplies to outlaws and the culprits must be brought to justice.
 
 

CPP Sindh General Secretary Comrade Iqbal demanded that Priya Kumari (who had gone missing in Aug 2021 while she was about seven-year-old and believed to have been kidnapped) should be traced out without further delay and reunited with her family. He stressed that all other men, women and children held hostage by dacoit gangs in Sindh must be recovered immediately.
WDJP leader Arz Mohammad deplored that people like Prof Ajmal Sawand, journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar, schoolteacher Allah Rakhio Nandwani and activist Hidayat Lohar were murdered but none of their killers could be arrested.
Writer and analyst Jami Chandio said that Sindh had once been regarded as ‘the land of peace’ but under a planned conspiracy its peace was destroyed. Sindhiani Tehreek President Umra Samoo, AT Secretary General Noor Katiar, Dr Badar Channa, Naimat Khuhro and Fahim Noonari also spoke at the rally.
They were of concerted view that PPP was ruling over Sindh for the last 16 years and pushed the province into primitive era. They added that the Irsa Act was amended “to commit robbery on Sindh’s water share”.
The speakers demanded formation of a judicial commission headed by serving Supreme Court judge to expose facilitators of dacoits and identify those supplying Nato weapons to them.

9,Five children of Tando Allahyar village die of measles,HYDERABAD: Five children — three of them sharing the same family — of Chando Meo village in Tando Allahyar ...,"HYDERABAD: Five children — three of them sharing the same family — of Chando Meo village in Tando Allahyar taluka died after developing measles related complications over the past 24 hours. 
Some of the children had been under treatment ever since they developed different complications, according to Dr Sabir Kaimkhani, medical superintendent of Tando Allahyar district hospital on Saturday.
Three of the children were identified as five-year-old Iqra daughter of Ashraf, her four-year-old brother, Ashiq, and their relative, three-year-old Asif son of Yameen. 
Dr Kaimkhani said that five deaths were reported in the village on April 26 and then five more children were brought to the hospital the same day. They included Adil son of Asif, 5; Adnan son of Asghar, 3; Atif son of Asif, 6; and Ashiq son of Ashraf, 5, and they were referred to Liaquat University Hospital (LUH), Hyderabad. 
One of them Adnan died in LUH followed by Ashfaq who died on his way back to Tando Allahyar as he left LUH under “leave against medical advice”, said Dr Kaimkhani.
He said that Atif was brought back to Tando Allahyar by his family who insisted that he should be admitted there. His condition was critical but the family did not agree to his admitting to the LUH, he said. 
Atif was now being shifted to LUH again after Tando Allahyar deputy commissioner spoke to LUH’s MS about him during his visit to the hospital on Saturday evening, he said.
He said that another child of Mushtaq, 7, son of Ashraf was brought to the hospital from the village but his condition was stable.
