1,Police ramp up border security,"Several attempts, attacks were reported on police border posts, particularly in Mianwali","In response to a significant rise in militant attacks over the past two years, Punjab Police has announced plans to enhance security arrangements, infrastructure, and logistics across eight border districts, including Bhakkar, Mianwali, Layyah, Rahim Yar Khan, and Rajanpur.
The decision comes amid a notable escalation in tacks on border posts by militants, with numerous attempts being foiled by security forces. Just this week, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Punjab successfully neutralized two militants attempting to infiltrate Punjab.
The terrorists, identified as members of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), were involved in targeting sensitive installations and security forces. Heavy weaponry, explosives, and ammunition were seized from the militants following the encounter in Bhakkar district. Earlier this year, several attempts and attacks were reported on police border posts, particularly in Mianwali and Bhakkar.
Several attempts and attacks were reported on police border posts, particularly in Mianwali and Bhakkar.
These incidents resulted in casualties, including the martyrdom of a Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) official and injuries to a Station House Officer (SHO). Militants have been utilising sophisticated technology, including thermal imaging and night vision cameras, to carry out attacks under the cover of darkness.
Footage of such attacks in Dera Ismail Khan, a border district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, underscores the severity of the threat faced by security forces. Reports indicate that the TTP has established a dedicated wing targeting border posts in Dera Ghazi Khan, prompting heightened vigilance among security personnel.
Additionally, a resurgence in dacoit activity along the kacha areas has compounded security concerns. Punjab Police is taking measures to equip border district police with modern tools and technology, including thermal cameras.
