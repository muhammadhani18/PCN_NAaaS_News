0,Lahore’s Ganga Ram Hospital bedevilled by missing facilities in name of revamp,"Missing facilities include vital tests, medicines and surgeries; patients suffering for last six months.","LAHORE: The Sir Ganga Ram Hospital seems to have halted its healthcare services as it has stopped conducting around 80pc of tests, provision of over 90pc medicines, including life-saving ones, and cut the number of surgeries by 50pc.
An official, privy to information, says two highly expensive machines, namely CT Scan and MRI, have been lying dumped in the stores for the last six months in the name of renovation under the revamp programme.
Talking about the negligence of the institute’s top hierarchy, he says, 25 expensive batteries of the CT Scan machine have reportedly been stolen and the management hushed the matter to avoid inquiries. The hospital authorities have taken the health secretary also on board and shelved the alleged theft case, the official says. Consequently, patients are forced to go to the private labs around the hospital for tests from where the admin and other staff of the hospital are allegedly getting shares.
 
 

The official source laments that routine tests, including those for the diagnosis of diseases like hepatitis B and C, liver, kidneys and heart etc, mandatory before every surgery in emergency wards, are also not being done.

Missing facilities include vital tests, medicines and surgeries; patients suffering for last six months

“For example, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test recommended for measuring the amount of ALP in the blood is not available. Abnormal levels of ALP maybe a sign of a wide range of health conditions, including liver disease, bone disorders and chronic kidney disease.”
The other tests not being done include TG/HDL, CK-MB, calcium, MG, phosphorus, lipase, electrolytes, V/m, thyroid function, Vitamin D, HCG etc.
One of the major factors for the missing test facility is the shortage of kits and reagents as the institute has failed to pay liabilities to the agents/companies.
In some cases, the official says, some doctors arrange money on their own to purchase kits from the private market to help poor patients but this is done randomly for the needy and deserving patients.
About the life-saving drugs, the official says, all kinds of medicines, even those prescribed to every second patient like panadol, are also not available in the hospital.
Following the critical shortage of panadol tablets, the doctors are prescribing panadol syrup to patients with high-grade temperature and body pains.
Similarly, omeprazole (capsule), a life-saving drug, mandatory for treatment at every emergency unit and prescribed to every patient with abnormal sugar level, is not available in the official supply for the last many months and the critical patients are being treated with ‘omeprazole sache’, a funny way to conceal ‘another criminal negligence crime’, the official says.
The life-saving heparin injection is highly important for heart seizure as it helps decrease clotting ability of the blood and prevents harmful clots from forming in blood vessels. The official says that in medical settings, non-availability of this life-saving drug at the government teaching institute like the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is not less than a crime.
There are reports that the doctors at the hospital have no option but to ask the admin to procure medicines through the local purchase (LP) system. Under this system, the medicines are purchased at many times high prices from an agent of choice, the official informs, alleging that the hospital management is getting hefty shares from the agents, making an enormous burden on the national exchequer.
“Same is the case with Profasi injection used to recommend for pregnant women at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. It is responsible for the normal development of eggs in a woman’s ovary. The drug is also commonly used for diagnosis or treatment of infertility in women. The hospital is known as one of the largest public health facilities for gynae-related treatment in Punjab but this life-saving drug is also not available at the hospital for the last many months. The patients are forced either to buy from the private pharmacies outside the hospital or made available by the management through the LP, the official says.
Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique paid five to six frequent visits to this mega teaching institute since he assumed office while health secretary Ali Jan also visited it multiple times.
The members of Punjab Assembly and other relevant authorities also visit the hospital to attend events or meetings but all the ‘visiting dignitaries’ have shut their eyes to the hospital issues they are kept in the dark by the hospital management, the officer alleges.
Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Medical Superintendent (MS) Prof Dr Moeenuddin declared the revamp as one of the leading factors behind the sorry state of affairs. He claimed things would improve next week, refusing to further comment on the patients’ troubles on the pretext of his busy schedule.

1,Call for parties to stop ‘renting themselves’ to establishment,"BNP-M's Sanaullah Baloch says everyone knows parliament has no power while PPP's Nafisa Shah says ""we should not be acting as rubber stamps"".","LAHORE: Political parties have been advised to stop ‘renting themselves’ to the powers that be if they want to see parliamentary democracy strengthened in Pakistan.
The suggestion came from the participants in the 5th Asma Jahangir Conference on the theme of ‘Reclaiming Democratic Spaces’ on Saturday.
Former Senator of BNP-M Sanaullah Baloch said everyone knew the parliament had no power. “All major political parties have become ‘rent a party’. Unless parties have self-accountability, parliamentary democracy will remain a distant dream,” Baloch said and added the Election Commission of Pakistan got independent in 2017 but what it did in February polls was before everyone showing how independent it (ECP) was. He lambasted the ECP as his party was also a victim of Form 47 manipulation in the last polls.
“Whatever happened in 1970 is being repeated today. Parliamentary democracy is all about equality, not about individual and building – it is a culture which does not exist in Pakistan,” he said and added had Pakistan been a parliamentary democracy it would not have lost half of the country.
Mr Baloch wondered how a judge could stop a political leader from making comments about the establishment and judges. He was referring to the ban imposed by a court on PTI founder Imran Khan in this regard. Sanaullah Baloch said the face that was actually ruling the country should be unmasked.
Senator Ali Zafar of the PTI said Imran Khan’s major achievement was giving a realization to the people that they could change things with the power of votes.
“Will of the people is nothing without a leader. There has been an interference of the outside forces — the establishment and judiciary — in the parliament democracy,” he said and added Quaid-i-Azam had asked the Parliament to make the constitution but it failed to make it till 1956. After that, there came the musical chairs and prime ministers came and went frequently. Subsequently, the parliament lost its reputation.
Mr Zafar said after Gen Zia’s martial law, parliamentarians joined him and after his death ‘revolving door politics’ started with Benazir in and Nawaz out and vice versa.
“Last two years parliamentarians did legislation by bulldozing the law. The people have started losing faith in parliamentarians who need to restore their respect,” he said and added that the ‘doctrine of necessity’ appeared every now and then. He said every institution needed to act within its sphere.
“Pakistan’s most population is young. It is aware of their rights. In the Feb polls, the PTI’s symbol was taken away to confuse the people but they voted for it despite all this,” Ali Zafar said.
PPP MNA Nafisa Shah said for the last 14 years, democracy was surviving and credit should be given to the 18th Amendment.
“At the moment we have a hybrid power system shared by others. But this hybrid system that started with the 2014 sit-in (of Imran Khan) is continuing,” she said and added if someone (Khan) said he would hold dialogue with this (military) and not with this (politicians), it would not help the cause of strengthening the parliament.
“We should not be acting as rubber stamps — parliament needs to show its independence.”
Khurram Dastgir of the PML-N said democracy and economy were hurt today but parliamentarians and political parties both were responsible for the weak democracy.
“Those making decisions — judiciary, bureaucracy and establishment — their accountability is not held not one per cent compared to the politicians. In the scale of corruption, Pakistan’s politicians are just the beginners,” Dastgir said.
Senior journalist and author Zahid Hussain moderated the session.

2,Harking back: Weather mostly is what makes us and our civilisation,The one question repeatedly asked is: “Just when was Lahore founded?” It seems this has invited several ...,"The one question repeatedly asked is: “Just when was Lahore founded?” It seems this has invited several versions. Normally the names of rulers are a benchmark. But then what existed before ‘rulers’ came?
In this piece we will not ignore the names of rulers, but we will run through events and processes to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. It might sound strange, but then the rise and fall of empires and rulers are primarily, repeat primarily, related to weather patterns that we are used to. Even the current Afghan wish to move eastwards has ancient historic roots. Ignore not the fact that most walled city Lahore inhabitants are Afghans.
The origin of Lahore primarily is related to the fall and emptying of Harappa. It is now an accepted fact that the monsoon rains and the resultant floods most likely made living there impossible. The move to higher grounds like Lahore, among others, was the result. Because of the River Ravi’s constant ‘meandering’ the Lahore port of Khizr, the patron saint of sailors and fishermen, came about. Lahore was truly then founded, and grain markets sprang up. But humans, in very small numbers, existed on the mound of Lahore before that.
The rains and flooding had a massive positive, as well as negative, aspect too. This piece is about that phenomenon. Research into the socio-political result of weather over the last 5,000 years is becoming an important aspect of history. Scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology at Pune have started to date historic events vis-à-vis the monsoons. They have factored in severe, medium, and light monsoons to crop outputs, and then, among other factors, tried to study invasions. The results are amazing.
While this research is important, earlier research on ‘The Chronology of Prehistoric India’ by Possehl and Rissman, provides detailed radio-carbon analysis of sub-continental archaeological sites. The end of human habitation of Harappa coincides by 200 years to that of Lahore’s founding. So, Lahore existed 200 years (approximately) before the last human left Harappa.  
Just why did Harappa collapse? We must not forget that a few billion years ago the sub-continent broke away from Africa and joined Asia. The push northwards, because of the Earth’s rotation, continues and will do so forever. For this reason, the mountains to the north of Pakistan increase in height by about two inches (approximately) every year. This movement and the Earth’s rotation has a direct effect of river ‘meandering’, as well as flooding.
Another half of Africa is in the process of breaking away and heading towards the sub-continent. But that will take a few million years to happen. It is a frightening prospect. The Chicago research provides a date as to when humans managed to move into the sub-continent – it’s called radiometric dating – and that stands at Alpha 899 or 103,800, which equals to approximately 19,800 BC. So, starting from Mehrgarh humans settled and grew crops and herded animals approximately 14,500 years ago. One research puts it at 15,000 BC. They then moved up the rivers and first settled in Mohenjo Daro and then Harappa.
All these ancient habitations were destroyed by flooding and river movement, with occasional dry spells. But river movements – meandering – and monsoons determined how and when and where humans lived. The raising of crops and animals and the ability to store them is what invited invaders. Invasions took place when others to the West faced starvation. So, the equation was set.
Most of the 11 major invasions of the sub-continent over 22 centuries starting from 6th century BC ending with the Mughal invader Babar in the 16th century, all happened during a ‘good monsoon’ when crops were plentiful. Amazingly, the original lands of the invaders had suffered no rains, or even plagues. Local starvation seems to have forced the invaders towards the sub-continent.
The Indian study has found that Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Achaemenid empire, and his successor Darius expanded their territory into the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent at a time marked by near-continuous good monsoon during the 6th century.
Scientists have known for years that the summer monsoon that delivers nearly 75 per cent of the annual rain on the sub-continent has played a key role in impacting societies and civilisations. Earlier research has indicated that the decline of the Indus Valley cities coincided with a weakening monsoon and more rains on the east, facilitating the rise of settlements along the Indo-Gangetic plains. In a way climate change has always been there.
“But there has been very little research on the monsoon and the invasions the sub-continent has experienced,” Dr. Naveen Gandhi, a specialist in ancient climate at the IITM who led the new study. Although weather scientists began to maintain rainfall records in the 19th century, signatures of the monsoon’s historical behaviour are imprinted in tree rings and mineral deposits found in caves.
Dr. Gandhi and his colleagues used tree rings in Kerala to reconstruct the monsoon’s behaviour from 1484 AD to 2003 AD and referred to mineral data from two caves in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, and caves in Iraq, Iran, and Uzbekistan to reconstruct a 10,000-year history of the monsoon.
“The greater the width of tree rings, the more abundant the rainfall.” The concentration of an oxygen isotope in the mineral deposits can also tell us about the historical performance of the monsoon. Their analysis combined with history textbook information has suggested that nine of 11 invasions on the continent occurred during phases of good monsoon.
The study shows that the arrival of the Huns in the 6th century AD, the Umayyad Caliphate in the 8th century AD, Mahmud of Ghazni in 1001 AD, Mohammad Ghori in 1175-85, and Bakhtiyar Khilji from 1197 to 1206 had all coincided with abundant rainfall. Many of these invasions also occurred during poor rainfall over central Asia.
If we study the movement of Afghans towards their eastern border we see a constant trickle towards Pakistan. The barren country forces them to move towards the east, where they tend to settle. Immigration is a deeply complex subject, and people only leave their land if starvation or a lack of opportunity faces the population.
In our times we see two major migration problems facing Lahore and Pakistan broadly. Lahore was inundated with Afghans during the Russian invasion. Today the old walled city has a 62 per cent majority population of Afghans. They worked as cheap labour, and our traders protected them.
Many years ago, while discussing this with the late Prof. Saleem Kaul of Peshawar University’s botany department, his opinion was that migration is always for human betterment. Today we see the Afghan migrants have opened their own shops and spread all over the city. One learns that they charge less for good and pay their taxes, unlike local traders. The same is the case in Karachi and Peshawar and other major cities.
But this has been the case over time, and by time one means centuries. So, we see human movement over time, let alone recent movement, is what we are because of humans moving to better places because of climate change. And yet we do not take this seriously.

4,Impacts of climate change highlighted in Asma Jahangir Conference,"LAHORE: A thought-provoking session, titled ‘Loss, Damage and Climate Reparations: Growing Inequalities and the...","LAHORE: A thought-provoking session, titled ‘Loss, Damage and Climate Reparations: Growing Inequalities and the Need for Economic and Climate Justice,’ attracted a large number of audience on the first day of the Asma Jahangir Conference being held at a private hotel on the Egerton Road. 
The session was moderated by environmental lawyer Ahmad Rafay Alam who is also a member of the Pakistan Climate Change Council. In his opening remarks, Mr Alam termed greenhouse gases emissions the cause of changing climate, rising temperatures and imbalance in environment while adding that rains were the outcome of global warming. He said 2022 floods had left Pakistan with USD 34bn damage. The capitalist’s countries responsible for heavy greenhouse gases emissions were not rectifying the situation by any means, he lamented.  
MNA and former parliamentary secretary for climate change Naz Baloch said Pakistan should be called the third pole of the world being home to 7,000 glaciers. Terming the impact of global warming serious, she said the 2022 floods had caused about USD 40bn loss to the country.  
Ms Naz said it was important to highlight that Global South and Global North had a gap of understanding as the developed countries were spending on war but not on climate change. “Pakistan is an agricultural country that’s why the 2022 floods damaged it a lot in various aspects while farmers’ livestock was washed out.  
The developed countries are contributing to carbon emissions,” she declared.  
“We must think it over. It’s about the survival of the planet and ecosystem,” said Baloch. 
Another panelist Baba Jan, a civil rights and climate change activist from Gilgit, regretted that forests were being cut without any limits and housing societies were being built. Capitalists in Pakistan have made restaurants and hotels even in lakes, he lamented.  
“The capitalist countries are damaging the planet far more by emitting greenhouse gases. Mother Nature is being damaged,” he added.  
Former Minister of State for Environment Malik Amin Aslam said humanity had been given a death warrant in the shape of climate change as it was a war on nature, which was reacting.  
“There are eight such countries of the world which are emitting 85pc greenhouse gases whereas Pakistan has less than one percent share of such emissions, the USA has 40pc contribution to greenhouse gases.”  
He termed the International Loss and Damage Fund not more than a lollipop. 
Farooq Tariq, the general secretary of Kissan Rabita Committee and president of Haqooq-i- Khalq Party, was of the view that the Israeli attack on the Palestinians was also a fatal side of climate change. To add insult to the injury, the capitalist countries are supporting Israel, he lamented.  
“We condemn all such countries vehemently,” he added.  
Mr Tariq said Pakistan demanded compensation of flood losses from the capitalist countries and added that Covid and climate change had thrown about R20m people of Pakistan into further poverty.

The party has begun reorganisation of the party after poor performance in bringing out protest rallies in Lahore and other districts in the province. The party had constituted a 26-member committee to plan and organise public meetings in Punjab but all the leadership remained in hiding and did not participate in the protest planned on the call of party’s founder chairman Imran Khan.
PTI central Punjab general secretary Hammad Azhar, who had constituted the committee and himself became convener of the committee, also did not participate in any protest rally. He has been in self-imposed hiding and has got bail from the Peshawar High Court.
In the latest move, Mr Azhar has constituted a three-member committee of the district organisation of Lahore. Mr Asghar Gujjar has been appointed as Lahore district president, Shabbir Gujjar as senior vice-president, Abdul Karim as senior vice-president and Hafiz Zeeshan as general secretary.
Congratulating the new office-bearers, Mr Azhar hoped that the new body would be able to organise and activate the party in Lahore.  
ARREST: The Punjab Police on Saturday raided the office of party MPA Farrukh Javed Moon and arrested his four employees and shifted them to some unidentified location.
In a statement on X on Saturday, Mr Azhar said Farrukh Moon had organised a rally on four-wheelers and two-wheelers carrying party flags and the very next day police raided his office.

6,Bill proposed in Punjab for increasing minimum age for girl marriage,"MPA and CPWB chairperson writes to Punjab home secretary, seeking support for legislation to raise minimum age to 18 years.","LAHORE: The Child Protection Welfare Bureau (CPWB) has proposed the Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2024-25 to the Punjab government. The bill suggests increasing the minimum age for girls to marry to 18 years.
CPWB Chairperson Sarah Ahmad has written to Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal, emphasizing the urgent need to address the harmful practice of child marriage. She cited the Pakistan Demographic Health Survey 2017-18, which revealed that 18pc of women aged between 20 to 24 in Punjab were married off before the age of 18 and 2pc were married before the age of 15.
As a member provincial assembly (MPA) and CPWB chairperson, Sarah Ahmad is seeking the support of the home department for the crucial legislative initiative.
The Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2024 is an updated version of the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929. It has been crafted to protect the health, safety and well-being of young girls affected by child marriage in the province.
The bill aligns with the 18th Amendment and is contextualized to Punjab. It aims to protect the rights and well-being of children, especially girls, ensuring that they can live, survive, develop and thrive in a family environment free of discrimination and violence.
Ms Ahmad has requested the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2024 to be tabled in the Provincial Assembly at the earliest, setting a precedent to promote child welfare, rights equality and public health.
The bill, available with Dawn, states that a marriage can be solemnised and registered on the production of a computerized national identity card (CNIC). In case of a dispute regarding the age of any contracting party, the court will determine the age based on a birth certificate, educational certificates or any other pertinent document. In the absence of such documents, the age may be determined based on a medical examination report.
The bill also proposes rigorous punishments for an adult marrying a child, solemnising or registering a child marriage and for parents or guardians involved in a child marriage. An adult who contracts a child marriage could face rigorous imprisonment of up to two years and/or a fine of up to Rs20,00,000.
Punjab Home Department Secretary Mr Mengal told Dawn that a meeting of the department was conducted about the submission of the draft law. He said the proposed Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2024-25 was submitted to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Cabinet.

An investigation is under way to determine the role of others involved in ‘disappearance’ of drugs from the main store of DHQ hospital.  
A three-member committee investigated the case and revealed that storekeeper Irfan Abbas along with his brother driver Imran Abbas and private person Ali Hassan have embezzled government medicines worth Rs90m.  
On the disclosure in the report of the inquiry committee of the health CEO, the ACE has registered a case under section 409/477A of Pakistan Penal Code and 5/2/47PCA against the three suspects. Irfan Abbas has been arrested while his brother Imran managed his escape from the spot.  
Locals, including the owner of a nearby medical store adjacent to DHQ hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it seemed quite impossible for a storekeeper to embezzle huge quantities of medicines without the blessings of the hospital superintendent and other high-ups of the health department.
REMOVED: The commissioner has removed a price control magistrate over poor performance and instructed nine other magistrates, including four assistant commissioners, to improve their work. 
He was addressing a review meeting of price control magistrates in his conference room on Saturday.

He emphasised the need to further reduce the price of bread after consulting stakeholders to provide relief to the public.  
He said it was commendable that under the vision of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the prescribed price for roti and naan was being implemented across the division, but strict action should also be taken against those selling underweight bread.  
He stressed that the prescribed rates of roti and naan with weight should be prominently displayed at every tandoor and sale point. He said that price magistrates should spend at least two hours daily in markets and also establish their camp offices in busy markets so that the public feels that the government is actively working to protect their rights.  
The individual performance of each price control magistrate was reviewed in the session.  
The commissioner directed all DCs and ACs to convene an immediate meeting with revenue officers regarding the important initiatives of the Board of Revenue.  
He asked the DCs to submit reports to his office regarding approval pertaining to residential colonies in accordance with the timelines issued by the chief secretary.

Manzar Abbas, a schoolteacher at the Govt High School Rajoa, was travelling on the Quaid-i-Azam Park Road on April 25 when a speeding car driven by a policeman, Mudasar Nazar, knocked him down. On exchange of harsh words with Abbas, Mudasar called five other police cops, including Afrasiab. 
The policemen thrashed Abbas up, tore off his clothes before taking him and his motorcycle to the City Police Station. They allegedly kept him in illegal confinement for two hours. 
He called the police helpline 1787 and his relatives, Shahid Yaqoob and Akhtar, also reached the police station. On their requests, police let him go while issuing threats to stop him from taking any action against the policemen. 
Manzar told the teachers community about his ordeal and the teachers submitted an application with the DSP City for registration of a case against the policemen involved in the incident. 
However, the police did not register a case against the suspects despite a passage of two days. 
Punjab Teachers Union President Safdar Kalru, Professors and Lecturers Association President Muhammad Imran and Headmasters Association President Zulfiqar Ali Tabassum demanded Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and the IGP to provide their colleague with justice or they would launch a strike. 
Police spokesperson Mohsin said the DSP City was conducting an inquiry into the matter and action would be taken after the inquiry. 
CONVICTED: Additional District and Sessions Judge Imtiaz Nadeem has awarded nine years’ term to drug dealer, Riaz Thathia, and imposed Rs50,000 fine on him.

Reports said Two Arrouti police ASIs Dildar Ahmad, Muhammad Zaheer, constable Muhammad Umair, a revenue department patwari Muzammal and a naib qasid Wajid Ali were injured when villagers attacked them during an anti-encroachment operation which was launched by Pirmahal assistant commissioner Nadeem Baloch.
A police officer claimed that when officials were demolishing houses built illegally on state land, suspect Tanweer Ahmad and his 30 accomplices attacked the team as a result five officials were wounded; however the AC remained unhurt.  
He said all the injured had been shifted to Arrouti rural health centre.  
He said force was also called from Arrouti and Pirmahal police stations. A number of men and women of the village had also been injured in police action. Villagers damaged five official vehicles, including the jeep of tehsildar.

12,Govt wants bulletproof vehicles for the Chinese in two days,LAHORE: The Punjab government has warned the non-CPEC project managements to ensure availability of bulletproof...,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has warned the non-CPEC project managements to ensure availability of bulletproof vehicles for Chinese nationals within two days otherwise the non-compliant project, site or installation be shut down.
The Punjab home department in a letter to the DIG Special Protection Unit (SPU) on Thursday stated that the Punjab chief minister had early this month conveyed and desired to ensure arrangement of bulletproof vehicles regarding the movement of foreigners/Chinese nationals working on public as well as private non-CPEC projects.
In the aftermath of the recent militant attack on Chinese nationals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had earlier this month chaired a high-level security meeting and directed ensuring the safety of the Chinese nationals working at non-CPEC projects and installations in Punjab.
Formalising the chief minister’s direction, the home department had written a letter to the DIG SPU on April 2 stating, “As an inevitable part of the security measures, it has been accented that no external movement of the Chinese nationals shall be made without bulletproof vehicles”. 
Hence, it was decided that managements of the non-CPEC projects and installations be given a two-week timeline to procure or arrange the bulletproof vehicles in consultation with the SPU.
The home department stressed that the DIG SPU should take up the matter with the projects’ managements urging them to procure or arrange the bulletproof vehicles for their respective projects for the safety and security of the Chinese nationals during the external movement.
The department had also made it clear that non-compliance on their part shall entail some harsh measures which may involve restricting the external movement. The home department had sought a compliance report within two weeks.
Sources in the home department told Dawn that some projects’ managements had acquired bulletproof vehicles on rent but still some gaps and violations had been reported.
The home department had also directed that the observance of security enablers at all the non-CPEC installations as stipulated in the interior ministry directions must be ensured so as to stave off any unpalatable incident.
In the latest communication to the DIG SPU, the home department has instructed that the projects’ managements should ensure availability of bulletproof vehicles either through purchase or on rental basis within two days, failing which the non-compliant project, site or installation would be closed.

13,Lawyers moot seeks withdrawal of terrorism cases,LAHORE: A lawyers’ convention on Saturday demanded cancellation of terrorism cases against advocates and ...,"LAHORE: A lawyers’ convention on Saturday demanded cancellation of terrorism cases against advocates and withdrawal of ‘unjust’ shifting of civil courts from city to Model Town.
Hosted by the Lahore High Court Bar Association, the convention was attended by the elected representatives of the bars from across the country.
They condemned the police raids at the chambers and the residences of the lawyers followed by their arrests under ‘fabricated’ terrorism charges.
They said the government had been trying to give an impression as if the lawyers were terrorists. The speakers termed the registration of FIRs carrying terrorism charges a conspiracy to corner the legal fraternity.
They said the judiciary’s history in Pakistan was filled with unconstitutional actions at the behest of the establishment and the intelligence agencies.
A declaration issued at convention called for removal of provisions related to terrorism charges from the cases against arrested lawyers. It also demanded dignified release of all lawyers arrested in the country.

Executive Engineer (EXEN) irrigation Muhammad Izhaar told Dawn that fresh flow of water was released in Dallas Branch canal four days ago which originates from main Panjnad Canal at Hajipur Headworks near Chachran Sharif downstream. 
He said there was 3,000 cusecs flow in Panjnad canal and 1,500 cusecs flow was in Dallas Branch canal. Owing to holes created by rats, the breach of 10-foot initially occurred between Stone 159-160 right at 4am on Saturday, later widened to 40 feet. Izhaar said the irrigation staff tried to control the breach but flow was high. Later, the machinery with excavators was called and rescue work started with support of labour force also.  
At last breach was fully plugged at 9am. He said the water inundated nearby 100 acres of fields. However, water damaged a few mud houses in a neighbouring locality.
