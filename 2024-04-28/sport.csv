LONDON: Liverpool’s fading Premier League title hopes were dealt a near-fatal blow on Saturday as West Ham United rescued a draw against Jurgen Klopp’s men while Sheffield United were relegated in ignominious fashion.
Manchester United’s push for Europe was dented by Burnley, who secured a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, keeping alive their hopes of survival.
Klopp’s glittering reign at Anfield appears to be ending on a flat note after they dropped points for the fourth time in five league games at the London Stadium.
Just weeks ago Liverpool, who won the League Cup in February, were on course for a quadruple of trophies but that is now a distant memory after FA Cup and Europa League exits and a string of damaging league results.
Liverpool would have moved level on points with leaders Arsenal with a victory, at least temporarily, but they failed to make the most of their chances despite a stirring second-half fightback.
The Gunners are on 77 points, two clear of Liverpool with a game in hand, while defending champions City have 76 points with two games in hand on the Reds.
Jarrod Bowen put David Moyes’ West Ham ahead shortly before half time but Liverpool looked a different side in the second period, taking the lead through Andy Robertson before an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.
But West Ham levelled in the 77th minute when Bowen wriggled free down the right and lifted a cross towards Michail Antonio, who headed home.
A downbeat Klopp, in the final weeks of his time at Anfield, said he did not want to talk about his side’s title chances.
“I’m not in the mood to talk about that to be honest or look at that at all,” he told TNT Sports.
“We had to win here, we knew that, and we didn’t, and now we have a little bit more time between now and the next game. We try to get the boys ready again and we will go again.”
The German bemoaned his side’s squandered chances, which have cost them dear in recent weeks.
“When we are 2-1 up we could control it, and still, as I said, in a lot of moments playing really well but the final situation we didn’t take,” he said. “That has been the story of the last four weeks.”
Klopp attempted to play down a touchline spat with Mohamed Salah, who was left out of the starting line-up, but the Egypt forward fanned the flames.
“There’s going to be a fire today if I speak,” he told reporters.
Pep Guardiola’s City, who play relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest on Sunday, are hot favourites to secure an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title.
Arsenal, who led the way for much of last season, are firmly in the hunt but face a tough away day at Tottenham Hotspur, also on Sunday.
In the day’s later match, Newcastle United’s 5-1 win against bottom club Sheffield United strengthened their push for European football next season but sent Chris Wilder’s team down to the Championship after just one season in the top flight.
Anel Ahmedhodzic gave the visitors an early lead at St James’ Park but two goals from Alexander Isak either side of a Bruno Guimaraes header turned it around.
An own goal by Ben Osborn deepened the woe for Sheffield United and Callum Wilson smashed in a fifth.
Newcastle remain in seventh place but are just one point behind Manchester United, who conceded a late penalty in a draw against Burnley.
Brazilian winger Antony scored his first Premier league goal of the season but Zeki Amdouni levelled from the spot in the 87th minute to leave the home side ruing missed chances.
Burnley are two points below Forest, who are just outside the relegation zone, and one point behind Luton Town.
Meanwhile, Hwang Hee-chan and Toti Gomes scored as Wolverhampton Wanderers deepened Luton’s woes with a 2-1 win and Fulham drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace.

1,Shaheen-inspired Pakistan square series against gutsy New Zealand,"Earlier after being put in to bat, Babar and Fakhar Zaman steer Pakistan to a solid-looking 178-5.","LAHORE: It proved a perfect series finale, having almost everything in it.
Amid loud cheers from boisterous crowd at a jam-packed Gaddafi Stadium, Pakistan kept their cool to avoid what would have been an absolutely shocking series loss to a significantly under-strength New Zealand side. 
Though the two run-outs in the very last over — of tailenders Ben Sears and William O’Rourke — bowled by an intelligent Mohammad Amir ended the game in an unexpected fashion, the Michael Bracewell-led tourists stretched Babar Azam and his men almost to the fullest before falling short by nine runs in the end.
First it was opener Tim Seifert and then late-order batter Josh Clarkson who gave goosebumps to the home fans — who were duly expecting their team to at least square the five-match series — as the tourists looked to chase a tough-looking 179 on a tricky wicket that had something for everyone. 
While pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi, who earned both player-of-the-match as well as the player-of the-series award, looked tip-top during his 4-30 show, all other bowlers raised their game just when it was required.
After conceding a four in the opening over of the innings, Shaheen went through Tom Blundell’s defences with a beautiful delivery that moved very slightly away to disturb the timber.
But Seifert had other ideas as the right-handed opener kept playing belligerent strokes. He welcomed Mohammad Amir with a first-ball straight six in the fourth over and followed it up with two fours. The wicket-keeper/batter in the next over greeted Abbas Afridi in the same manner on his very first ball and backed it with a four, giving a clear message to the opposition that he means swift business.
New Zealand raced to 63-1 in the first six overs. Seifert completed a 29-ball fifty in the seventh over, his ninth in T20 Internationals, but was soon cleaned up excellently by leg-spinner Usama Mir on his very first delivery of the match as Pakistan took a sigh of relief. When dagerman Mark Chapman (12 off 12) was bowled by Usama while trying a sweep with New Zealand sitting nicely at 97-2 in the 11th over, it caused a mini collapse for New Zealand and gave Pakistan the conviction that they can do it. 
In the very next over, the tourists received another jolt when Bracewell (23 off 21) was caught by Babar at short mid-wicket off Shadab and Cole McConchie (one) was trapped in front by left-arm spinner Imad Wasim on his very first ball of the 13th over to leave New Zealand at 103-5.
The 15th over bowled by Shaheen dented New Zealand further as the lanky pacer sent experienced James Neesham (16 off eight) and Zakary Foulkes (duck) back on back-to-back deliveries. Ish Sodhi became Shaheen’s fourth victim in the 17th over as the leg-spinning all-rounder was trapped and New Zealand slipped further to 137-8.
It looked almost over for New Zealand. But there was one man left in the hut about whom not many in Pakistan and the rest of the cricketing world currently know — Clarkson. Batting at number seven, he from nowhere smashed an unbeaten 38 off 26 with the help of three fours and two sixes keeping thousands at the ground and millions across Pakistan at the edge of their seats.
Usama’s 2-21 off four overs was equally important for Pakistan to sneak through.
Earlier after being put in to bat, Babar and Fakhar Zaman steered Pakistan to a solid-looking 178-5. 
Saim Ayub’s struggles in the series continued as the left-handed opener tried to lift pacer William O’Rourke in the second over of the innings but mistimed it and was caught at mid-off by New Zealand skipper Bracewell. Babar was then joined by Usman Khan.
Having got off the mark with a boundary over square leg in the first over bowled by Zakary Foulkes, Babar cracked some exquisite shots including a huge six off the same bowler in the third over. The Pakistan captain then struck fast bowler Ben Sears for three fours — including his signature flick through midwicket — in the very next over that fetched the hosts 16 runs.
Pakistan reached 51-1 in the powerplay as Babar and Usman gradually developed their partnership amid cheers from a near-capacity crowd.
Right-handed Usman, who failed to impress after making T20I debut earlier in this series, finally made amends at least some while making a 29-ball 31.
The 28-year-old smashed a straight six off off-spinner Bracewell followed by a four through square leg in the eighth over that cost the tourists 15 runs. But the 28-year-old was magnificently caught by Bracewell at extra cover off veteran leg-spinner Ish Sodhi in the very next over. Usman added 73 with Babar off 44 balls. Fakhar Zaman came in to bat number four.
Babar meanwhile continued with his impressive strokeplay and in the process completed his half-century, the batter’s 34th in T20 Internationals.
Pakistan brought up their 100 in the 13th over bowled by Sodhi who in the same over was belted for a six by Babar.
Left-handed Fakhar, who made 43 off 33, took his time before starting to unleash strokes. 
Ben Sears was smashed by Fakhar for a four in the 15th over but the paceman came back in the same over by penetrating a rock-solid strong defences of Babar with a superb yorker that crashed into the middle stump. The batter collected a 44-ball 69 studded with six fours and a couple of maximums.
Fakhar struck a couple of fours and a characteristic six over mid-wicket on a short-pitched ball by Sears in the 18th over which produced 19 runs. He was magnificently caught at the boundary in the final over of the innings 
While Iftikhar Ahmed (six) was undone by Neesham in the 19th over, Shadab’s cameo (15 not out off five) made sure Pakistan get a fighting total in the end. 
Fakhar was magnificently caught by Chapman at the boundary in the final over off Foulkes.

DUCATI’S Spanish rider Jorge Martin celebrates after winning the Sprint race of the MotoGP Spanish Grand Prix at the Jerez racetrack on Saturday.—AFP

 
JEREZ FRONTERA: Jorge Martin extended his lead in the MotoGP standings as he won the Spanish Grand Prix sprint in Jerez on Saturday after Marc Marquez crashed out while leading late in the race.
Teenager Pedro Acosta was runner up to take second in the championship race with former world champion Fabio Quartararo third as nine riders failed to finish.
All three podium finishers described the track, dappled with damp after morning rain, as tricky.
“A difficult race, the track conditions were super hard,” said Martin in his on-track interview.
Marquez, with his first pole since joining Ducati Gresini, and Martin started on the front row, but South African Brad Binder shot off from the second row to grab the lead on his KTM.
Spaniard Martin overtook on lap two and pulled away from the chaotic battle behind him as riders kept tumbling.
Defending cham­pion Francesco Bag­naia went down on lap three.
Binder squeezed past on the inside, forcing the Italian into another bike.
Bagnaia’s Ducati went flying, out of the race and out of the points.
Martin built a comfortable lead but Marquez was the fastest bike on the course and closed in. Under pressure, Martin made a mistake on lap seven and Marquez pounced.
With three laps left Marquez hit a damp patch and slid off. He remounted to finish seventh.
“I had a good start but then I saw Marquez was coming even though I was pushing a lot, a lot, a lot,” said Martin. “Marc overtook me because I made a mistake on corner seven. Then I tried to push him and he made a mistake.”
Acosta, who started on the fourth row on his GasGas, came through to take second.
Martin went to 92 points in the standings, 29 clear of Acosta who took over second, four points head of Italian Enea Bastianini of Ducati who did not finish.
Spaniard Maverick Vinales, a double winner in Austin last time, is fourth after he too fell on his Aprilia.
Yamaha’s Quartararo, who had started 23rd out of 25 riders, held off a late challenge from Spanish veteran Dani Pedrosa on a KTM to complete the podium.
Martin said he hoped the track would be easier for Sunday’s main race.
“Tomorrow in dry conditions it will be a different story,” he said.

3,Olympic torch sets sail for France,"PIRAEUS: The Olympic flame set sail on Saturday on its voyage to France on board the Belem, the Torch Relay reaching...","PIRAEUS: The Olympic flame set sail on Saturday on its voyage to France on board the Belem, the Torch Relay reaching its climax at the revolutionary Paris Games opening ceremony along the river Seine on July 26.
“The feelings are so exceptional. It’s such an emotion for me”, Tony Estanguet, Paris Olympics chief organiser, told reporters before the departure of the ship from Piraeus.
He hailed the  “great coincidence” how the Belem was launched just weeks after the first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896.
“These games mean a lot. It’s been a centenary since the last time we organised the Olympic games in our country,” he added.
The 19th-century three-masted boat set sail on a calm sea but under cloudy skies.
It was accompanied off the port of Piraeus by the trireme Olympias of the Greek Navy and 25 sailing boats while dozens of people watched behind railings for security reasons.
On Sunday, the ship will pass from the Corinth Canal — a feat of 19th century engineering constructed with the contribution of French banks and engineers.
The Belem is set to reach Marseille — where a Greek colony was founded in around 600 BCE — on May 8. Over 1,000 vessels will accompany its approach to the harbour, local officials have said.
French swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first torch bearer in Marseille. His sister Laure was the second torch bearer in ancient Olympia, where the flame was lit on April 16.
Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories.
It will travel through more than 450 towns and cities, and dozens of tourist attractions during its 12,000-kilometre journey through mainland France and overseas French territories in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific.
It will then reach Paris and be the centre piece of the hugely imaginative and new approach to the Games opening ceremony.
Instead of the traditional approach of parading through the athletics stadium at the start of the Games, teams are set to sail down the Seine on a flotilla of boats in front of up to 500,000 spectators, including people watching from nearby buildings.
The torch harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games. The tradition was revived in 1936 for the Berlin Games.
Estanguet said the goal for Paris was to organise  “spectacular but also more responsible Games, which will contribute towards a more inclusive society.”
Organisers want to ensure  “the biggest event in the world plays an accelerating role in addressing the crucial questions of our time,” said Estanguet.
A duo of French champions, Beijing 2022 ice dance gold medallist Gabriella Papadakis and former swimmer Beatrice Hess, one of the most successful Paralympians in history, carried the flame during the final relay leg into the Panathenaic Stadium.

4,IOC chief Bach backs world doping body over positive Chinese tests,"“We have full confidence in WADA and the regulations and that WADA have followed their regulations,” Bach says."," 

IOC President Thomas Bach gestures during an interview ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at the IOC headquarters.—AFP

LAUSANNE: The head of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach has backed the World Anti-Doping Agency in a row over its handling of positive drug tests by 23 Chinese swimmers.
“We have full confidence in WADA and the regulations and that WADA have followed their regulations,” Bach told AFP in an exclusive interview on Friday at the committee’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
WADA has faced criticism since media reports last weekend revealed that the Chinese swimmers tested positive for heart drug trimetazidine (TMZ) — which can enhance performance — ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.
The swimmers were not suspended or sanctioned after WADA accepted the explanation of Chinese authorities that the results were caused by food contamination at a hotel where they had stayed.
The head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), Travis Tygart, has called the situation a  “potential cover-up” with the positive tests never made public at the time.
Bach stressed that WADA was run independently, despite being funded by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and he said he had learned of the positive tests via the media.
The IOC was awaiting the results of a new investigation ordered by WADA on Thursday, but Bach said the Chinese swimmers could compete at the Paris Olympics this year if cleared.
“If the procedures are followed, there is no reason for them not to be there,” the 70-year-old former German fencer added.
The Paris Games are set to be important to  “revive the Olympic spirit” after the last Covid-affected edition in Tokyo in 2021 saw sport play out in empty stadiums, Bach said.
The hugely ambitious opening ceremony being planned by French organisers remains one of the biggest doubts, with infrastructure for the Games either already built or on track.
Instead of a traditional parade through the athletics stadium on the first night, teams are set to sail down the Seine on a flotilla of river boats in front of up to 500,000 spectators.
Worries about a terror attack have led to persistent speculation that the ceremony might need to be scrapped or scaled back dramatically.
“The very meticulous, very professional approach (from French authorities) gives us all the confidence that we can have this opening ceremony on the river Seine and that this opening ceremony will be iconic, will be unforgettable for the athletes, and everybody will be safe and secure,” Bach said.
Recent grumbling from Paris residents and negative media reports were typical of the run-up to any Olympics, he said, and also a symptom of broader anxiety.
“It’s part of our zeitgeist because we are living in uncertain times. And there are people who are sceptical. Some are even scared. Some are worried about their future,” the IOC president said.
DIPLOMATIC TIGHTROPE
As with previous Olympics, international politics and diplomacy are set to intrude on the world’s biggest sporting event.
Bach reinterated his support for the IOC’s policy of excluding Russia from the Paris Games over the  “blatant violation” of the Olympic charter when it annexed Ukrainian sporting organisations.
A small number of Russian athletes will be able to compete as neutrals in Paris, providing they have not declared public support for the invasion of Ukraine or are associated with the security forces.
Any Russian athlete that expressed political views on the field of play, including the  “Z” sign that has come to symbolise Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war, could be excluded.
“Immediately a disciplinary procedure would be opened and the necessary measures and or sanctions be taken,” Bach said, adding:  “This can go up to immediate exclusion from the Games.”
Addressing Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, he said between six and eight Palestinian athletes were expected to compete in Paris, with some set to be invited by the IOC even if they fail to qualify.
Bach dismissed any suggestion that the IOC had treated Russia differently over its invasion of Ukraine compared with Israel and its war in Gaza.
“The situation between Israel and Palestine is completely different,” he said.
He said he had been even-handed in his public statements on Ukraine, the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 and the subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza.
“From day one, we expressed how horrified we were, first on the seventh of October and then about the war and its horrifying consequences,” Bach said.
Bach is in the last year of what should be a second and final four-year term according to IOC rules.
But some IOC members have suggested changing the organisation’s statutes to enable him to stay at the helm — an issue he declined to address.
“The IOC Ethics Commission has given me the strict recommendation not to address this question before the end of (the) Paris (Olympics) and I think they have good reasons for this,” he said.

5,Nadal excited by prospect of partnering Alcaraz at Paris 2024,MADRID: Rafa Nadal said it would be exciting to partner fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz at the Paris Olympics this...,"MADRID: Rafa Nadal said it would be exciting to partner fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz at the Paris Olympics this year and the 22-times singles Grand Slam champion hoped they can enter some doubles tournaments in the build-up to the Games.
Singles world number three Alcaraz said previously he would like to play at the Olympics alongside his 37-year-old idol, who expects to bring the curtains down on his glittering but injury-plagued career this year.
At the Madrid Open where the duo are competing this week, the 20-year-old admitted to being somewhat nervous about initiating the discussion but Nadal put him at ease.
“Carlos doesn’t have to ask me anything, all things being well, we’ll play,” Nadal said during the IGUALES podcast.  “It’s also hugely exciting for me. If I’m not mistaken, I’ve heard it is for him too.
“So it would be great to play the odd tournament before the Olympics to prepare ourselves and to get some rapport on court.”
While twice Grand Slam champion Alcaraz is set to make his Olympic debut in the July 26-Aug 11 Games, Nadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio.
But Nadal has had a torrid time with injury in recent years, missing nearly all of 2023 with a hip issue that needed surgery.
The tennis competition at the Paris Games will take place on clay at Roland Garros, where Nadal has won 14 major titles.
“I think if we’re both fit enough, why not? We could have the chance to form a great team and aspire to great things,” Nadal said of the partnership.
“It would be good for both of us. It would also be good for the Spanish team, so we’ll see how things progress.”

Having returned to the Punjab Kings side after missing their last two matches due to patchy form, Bairstow struck an unbeaten 108 off 48 balls as his side pulled off the highest successful run chase in T20 history on Friday.
Needing 262 to defeat Kolkata Knight Riders, Bairstow and Shashank Singh helped Punjab cross the finish line with eight wickets and eight balls left, breaking the record held by South Africa when they made 259 to beat the West Indies last year.
“We knew we had to go ballistic after how they batted,” said Bairstow, who smashed eight fours and nine sixes to be named man of the match.
“We had to take risks and thankfully they came off. I’ve never been faced with a target like that before. So we knew the powerplay would be important and if anything is close to being in your area you’ve got to make the most of it.”
Bairstow and Shashank — who hit an unbeaten 68 off 28 balls — stitched together an unbroken 84-run third-wicket partnership as Punjab posted the joint-highest score in the IPL for a team batting second.
The 34-year-old heaped praise on his Indian team-mate who produced some late fireworks himself.
“Shashank’s done it all season, a lovely guy and special player,” Bairstow said.  “To have someone like him coming in and doing that is unbelievable.”
England are expected to name their World Cup squad next week for the tournament that will be held in the West Indies and the United States.

7,No world record but Duplantis soars at Suzhou Diamond League,SUZHOU: Armand Duplantis missed out on another pole vault world record but made a strong statement ahead of this...,"SUZHOU: Armand Duplantis missed out on another pole vault world record but made a strong statement ahead of this year’s Olympic Games by easing to victory in the second Diamond League event of the season on Saturday.
The 24-year-old Olympic champion had broken his own world record with a stellar effort of 6.24 metres at the Xiamen season opener last week and wrapped up another victory in China with his best of 6.00m too good for the rest of the pack.
With the bar raised to 6.25m, Duplantis was primed to break the mark for a ninth time but he was unable to clear the height in his three attempts, coming agonisingly close in his final chance to leave some fans disappointed.
“I felt great today, really good. To jump 6.00m today and complete a successful tour, I have a lot of good takeaways,” Duplantis said.
“I felt a little bit flat today, but still really good. I just feel conditions have to be perfect for me to jump a world record and I wasn’t quite feeling it off the runway tonight.
“Now I go back home and train for a few weeks until my next competition in Ostrava.”
Ben Broeders of Belgium and Sam Kendricks of the United States managed vaults of 5.82m behind the winner.
Akani Simbine powered to victory in the men’s 100m race in the Shanghai leg of the premier track and field series which is being held in the neighbouring city of Suzhou this year due to stadium renovation.
The South African made a good start and crossed the finish line in 10.01 seconds to deny reigning Diamond League champion Christian Coleman of the United States back-to-back victories this season.
Coleman’s pace dropped towards the end and he settled for silver with a time of 10.04 seconds, ahead of compatriot Fred Kerley who clocked in at 10.11 seconds for bronze.
Briton Daryll Neita stunned pre-race favourite Sha’Carri Richardson in the women’s 200m with a time of 22.62 seconds.
“I feel amazing. It was such a strong field and to run that time at this stage of the season is amazing,” Neita said.
“My main focus for the rest of the season is to stay healthy and in one piece. I hope to win a medal at the Olympics.”
Richardson, the winner of the 200m bronze at last year’s world championships, was third behind fellow American Anavia Battle who came in at 22.99 seconds.
World champion Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic backed up her gold from Xiamen by cruising to the women’s 400m gold in 50.89 seconds.
She was comfortably ahead of American Talitha Diggs and Barbadian Sada Williams to put down a marker for the Olympics which will be held in Paris.
In the dramatic women’s 100m hurdles, world-record holder Tobi Amusan was disqualified following a false start before the Nigerian ran under protest and finished first ahead of Jasmine Camacho-Quinn.
Barring a successful appeal from Amusan, Olympic champion Camacho-Quinn will earn a second victory of the season with her effort of 12.63 seconds.
“I was ready to throw it. It took such a long time to get going,” said Camacho-Quinn.
“I’ll take the points and take a break. I can’t believe the time, but it is what it is. There were three of us in a line, so I didn’t know who had won.
“These meets are just preparation (for the Olympics) and I know what I need to work on.”
Ethiopia’s Olympic 10,000m champion Selemon Barega won the men’s 5000m in 12:55.68 while Kenya’s Beatrice Chepkoech took gold in the women’s 3,000m steeplechase.

The result leaves Leicester top of the Championship with 94 points with two games to play while Leeds stay second on 90 but with just one match left.
Third-place Ipswich Town can pip Leeds to the second automatic promotion place as they currently have 89 points with three matches still to play.
“It’s not in our hands anymore (automatic promotion), we need to be honest,” Leeds boss Daniel Farke told the BBC.
“The race is not over, if Ipswich win the next two games then I will say congratulations but if they don’t win them then we will have a lot to play for (against Southampton on the final day of the season).
“As long as we have a chance, I’m far away from giving up.”
Enzo Maresca’s Foxes achieved promotion at the first time of asking having been relegated from the Premier League last season.
Their final two games begin with a trip to Preston on Monday, before they round off the season with a home finale against Blackburn on May 4.
Leeds will find themselves outside the top two if Ipswich beat Hull or Coventry in their game in hand.
Should Ipswich win both, they will be promoted while Leeds will have to enter the play-offs.Leicester were shock Premier League champions in 2016 but were relegated with Leeds and Southampton last season.
On Tuesday, Leicester demolished the Saints 5-0 thanks to a Issahaky Fatawu hat-trick and goals from Wilfred Ndidi and evergreen striker Jamie Vardy.
That resounding victory put them on the brink of a Premier League return.
Joy at promotion will be tempered to a degree after they were charged in March by the Premier League for alleged breaches of profit and sustainability rules relating to their last three years in the top flight. If found guilty, Leicester could start life back in the top flight with a points deduction.

SAN SEBASTIAN: Arda Guler scored to earn a second-string Real Madrid side a 1-0 win at Real Sociedad on Friday, moving the La Liga leaders a step closer to a record-extending 36th Spanish title.
With five games remaining, Real climbed to 84 points and extended their lead to 14 points over second-placed Barcelona, who have a game in hand and host Valencia on Monday.
Real manager Carlo Ancelotti made nine changes to the team who beat Barca 3-2 on Sunday, resting key players like Jude Bellingham and Toni Kroos ahead of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich and his side did just enough to secure the three points.
“It was clear that everyone thought we were coming here for a walk,” Ancelotti told reporters.  “The only ones who didn’t think so were the players. They had commitment and attitude. They had the desire and enthusiasm to keep winning.”
Six-placed Real Sociedad, fighting for a Europa League spot, dominated possession under pouring rain in northern Spain and had a few good chances saved by Real keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
The visitors made the most of the only chance they had in the first half, when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Guler, making his first start for Real after signing from Fenerbahce, turned home Dani Carvajal’s cross in the 29th minute.
“Arda scored a goal, Arda will be an important player for us in the future, there’s no doubt he’ll be here next year,” Ancelotti told reporters.
Three minutes later Takefusa Kubo thought he had scored the equaliser with a tidy finish from close range, but the referee ruled the goal out after spotting a foul in the build-up following a VAR check.
The hosts pushed for an equaliser after the break but had another goal ruled out, a strike from Mikel Merino who was offside, and a shot from the edge of the box by Benat Turrientes was saved by the inspired Arrizabalaga.
Real Madrid almost ended up extending their lead later on, with Alex Remiro making a brilliant reflex save to deny Eduardo Camavinga’s strike from close range.
“We have a spectacular squad. They have this attitude that they feel like they have to win every game. There are four points left to clinch the La Liga title and we are very close,” Ancelotti said.
The match was brought forward to Friday from Saturday at little more  than a week’s notice, to help Real prepare for their Champions League  match at Bayern.
“It’s a pity, whoever watched the game knew that we deserved to win,” added Kubo. “It’s a pity for the fans, because of the rain, the change of schedule... all that rubbish.”

10,Alcaraz and Sabalenka advance at Madrid Openw,MADRID: Defending Mad­rid Open champions Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka both triumphed in their opening clashes...,"MADRID: Defending Mad­rid Open champions Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka both triumphed in their opening clashes in the Spanish capital on Friday to reach the third round.
Alcaraz returned after a month out to begin his double defence with a convincing 6-2, 6-1 win over Alexander Shevchenko, while Sabalenka survived a tense three-set tussle against the in-form Magda Linette.
Men’s world number three Alcaraz shone on home clay after a forearm problem led to his withdrawals from the Monte Carlo Masters and Barcelona Open.
“It’s been quite a tough month for me, with the uncertainty over when I’d be back,” said Alcaraz. “The priority today was to see how I felt, in a difficult match.
“The feelings were very good, and I think I played at a very good level despite coming without rhythm... I am very happy and it’s a pleasure to play here in Madrid again.”
Wearing a protective sleeve on his right arm, two-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz quickly dispelled any doubts after his time out by flying out of the blocks in the first set with a break.
The 20-year-old Spaniard was as exciting as ever, frequently on the attack, and secured a second break in the fifth game for a 4-1 lead.
Indian Wells winner Alcaraz hit the net with a drop shot to let the Kazakhstani back in but broke again himself for a 5-2 advantage which he served out.
Alcaraz pulled off two second set breaks for a 3-0 lead but again allowed his 23-year-old opponent to cut the deficit before striking back with a third break, which he consolidated for 5-1.
The 2022 and 2023 Madrid winner and second seed wrapped up his victory in little over an hour with another break when Shevchenko sent a forehand long.
Alcaraz will face Thiago Seyboth Wild in the third round after the Brazilian surprised Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-4.
Andrey Rublev ended a four-match losing streak with a straightforward 6-1, 6-4 win over Facundo Bagnis.
“It feels really great after a while to start with a win and I’m happy with my performance,” said Rublev, who lost his temper and obliterated his racquet after a first round exit in Barcelona.
German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, the champion in 2018 and 2021, comfortably made the third round with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Borna Coric.
In the women’s draw Sabalenka edged Linette 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
The Australian Open winner has struggled since her triumph in Melbourne and her Polish opponent fought well in the two-hour nine minute contest.
Big-hitter Sabalenka, ranked second in the world, edged the first set but struggled in the second as Linette broke to love and then consolidated for a 4-1 lead.
The 32-year-old then carved out three break points in the sixth game but although she could not take them, eventually steered the match to a deciding third set.
Two-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka saved three break points to stay on serve and then found a net cord winner to break herself for a 5-3 lead.
Sabalenka, 25, wrapped up her narrow victory over the world number 48 by smashing down an ace and will face Robin Montgomery in the third round.
“I think in that second set she just put a little extra pressure on my serve, and I just didn’t handle my emotions well,” said Sabalenka.
“We went to a third set, and I’m just happy that I was able to close this match with a win.”
Elena Rybakina eased past Lucia Bronzetti 6-4, 6-3.
The Kazakhstani, ranked fourth in the world and with a tour-leading three titles this season, continued her good form after triumphing in Stuttgart last week.
Rybakina faces Egyptian Mayar Sherif in the next round after she surprised Stuttgart runner-up Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 7-5.
Chinese fifth seed Zheng Qinwen retired with a thigh injury from her match against Yulia Putintseva, who had taken a 7-5, 2-0 lead.
Sixteen-year-old Mirra Andreeva, who made the fourth round in 2023, won the battle of teenagers to defeat Linda Noskova 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
