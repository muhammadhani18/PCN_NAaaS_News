Officials told Dawn that 18kg of heroin and 14kg of ice drug were recovered from a truck after its entry from Afghanistan.
They said the driver was taken into custody for interrogation, while the truck and the contraband were shifted to the custom warehouse.
Meanwhile, the Customs House in Peshawar said the drugs were seized on a tip-off.
In a statement, provincial chief collector (customs) Khwaja Saeed Akram said that a suspected vehicle was stopped at Zero Point on the Torkham border crossing and the inspection led to the recovery of 18kg of heroin and 14kg of ice drug from its secret cavities.
He claimed that the “market value” of the seized drugs was around Rs1 billion.
The official insisted that the customs department had controlled goods smuggling to a large extent and therefore, most of the foreign items were entering the country by legal means.
He said the revenue generated by his department in the current fiscal year surpassed last year’s.

2,PTI leader Taimur Jhagra claims recovery of ‘original’ Form 45 from dumping site,Says will produce document before poll tribunal as rigging evidence.,"PESHAWAR: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Taimur Saleem Jhagra on Saturday claimed that he had received an envelope with “original” Form 45 containing the initial results of the Feb 8 general election in his constituency of PK-79 in the provincial capital.
“The Form 45 that I received from an unidentified person was recovered from a garbage site and sent to my home by the Pakistan Post service. The form was sealed by the Election Commission of Pakistan over the alleged poll rigging,” the PTI leader told a news conference here.
Mr Jhagra, who contested the Feb 8 election in that constituency and was declared an unsuccessful candidate, said the act of disposing of Form 45 as garbage confirmed his party’s claims of massive rigging in polls to one national and eight provincial assembly seats in Peshawar.
“The recovery of this Form 45 proved that election results from these constituencies were changed after the electoral exercise,” he said.

Jhagra says will produce document before poll tribunal as rigging evidence 

Mr Jhagra, a former finance and health minister in the province, wondered why the PTI’s provincial government hadn’t acted against the district returning officer and returning officers for “rigging elections to deprive the party of one national and eight provincial assembly seats.”
He said the provincial government should have taken action against the DRO and ROs on time as they deprived Peshawarites of their “genuine leadership under a conspiracy.”
The PTI leader also criticised the ECP for not acting against Peshawar’s deputy commissioner and several assistant commissioners, who served in the last elections as the DRO and ROs respectively. 
Waving Form 45, he said he would produce the document before the election tribunal as evidence of poll rigging as it was set to start proceedings.
Mr Jhagra said the judiciary shouldn’t delay the dispensation of justice to the PTI over election rigging.
“The Election Commission of Pakistan stole people’s mandate for us to represent them in assemblies,” he said.
The PTI candidate said the DC of Peshawar and ROs should have been removed from their respective positions over their role in poll rigging.
“How will they serve people honestly after rigging elections so openly?”
Mr Jhagra said he was ready to furnish the recovered Form 45 for any inquiry and had no issues if it was sent to the lab for a forensic examination.
PTI leader and former provincial higher education minister Kamran Bangash, who was also in attendance, said the recovery of Form 45 from a dumping site was reported to the Chamkani police station.
He said the development had proved poll rigging, as claimed by the PTI.
“Results of elections to one national and eight provincial assembly seats in Peshawar were not declared according to the original Form 45, and they’ve been changed in Form 47 to favour our opponents,” he insisted.
Mr Bangash, who contested the election in PK-82, said he got 11 votes at one of the polling stations adjacent to his home, though his family had 25 voters, proving that the results were changed for the victory of his opponent.
He said he polled just two votes at another polling station, where 45 office-bearers of the PTI were registered as voters.
The PTI leader claimed that the returning officer uploaded the “fudged” Form 45 of 51 polling stations in his constituency.
PTI leader Engineer Hamidul Haq and other PTI candidates, who were also present on the occasion, claimed the ECP “dishonestly” declared them poll losers.

A non-government organisation, Pak Mission Society (PMS), arranged the seminar in Bisham to create awareness among the people of Shangla, Lower and Upper Kohistan and Kolai Pallas districts about the significance of collaborative efforts to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on their lives. 
The speakers said women of the disaster-prone Shangla and Kohistan regions had been particularly affected as they didn’t have access to healthcare nor did they receive proper nutrition.
Ayesha Saeed, Kolai Pallas district education officer (women), said people needed to adopt the ways to ensure risk reduction in the event of a natural disaster.
She said she planned to hold a meeting with the teachers and inform them about the techniques of minimising the risks in disaster-prone areas and to create awareness about it in schools and their communities.
Ms Saeed urged the government and non-government organisations to come forward and create awareness among the vulnerable communities through different channels to protect their lives and their future from natural disasters.
Sharafat Ali, an education department official, said combating natural disasters was not the primary responsibility of the government, and the communities too needed to play their role in reducing the risks by carrying out tree plantations, avoiding constructions near rivers, streams and deforestation.
Fazal Azeem, a representative of PMS, said the NGO was working on the disaster management in Shangla and Kohistan regions in collaboration with the district administrations and local stakeholders.
ACCIDENT: Three people, including a woman, were injured when a car and a pick-up van collided on the Karakoram Highway in Batkot area of Bisham tehsil on Saturday.
Rescue 1122 spokesman Rasool Khan Sharif told Dawn that both the vehicles were heading in the opposite directions when they collided.
He said a rescue team shifted the injured to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.

9,TV artist wants to stage comeback to showbiz after 15 years,Nazia Ali optimistic to get attention of her fans,"PESHAAWAR: Noted TV artist Nazia Ali has decided to stage a comeback after 15 years long absence, expressing the hope that she will spare time to come up to the expectations of her fans in the altogether changed showbiz scenario.
She launched her acting career in 1996 from Peshawar centre of Pakistan Television (PTV). She remained on TV screen till 2009 but quit showbiz due to marriage and tight job schedule.
The artist performed in about 100 Pashto and Urdu plays and played out lead characters mostly tragedy dramas, earning a widespread fame owing to her delivery of dialogues and serious facial expressions. She grabbed several awards for her quality performances on PTV.
“I want to do projects with PTV despite the changed landscape. I am determined to pursue my career once again provided that I could get projects with stress on quality contents. I don’t want to work for social media,” said Ms Alithe actress stated.

Nazia Ali optimistic to get attention of her fans

Acting was like oxygen for me and after quitting showbiz, I felt being caged as the actress within me wanted to break the shackles and rejoined my acting career after 15 years long break, the artist recalled. The decision to quit my acting career was tough but my family responsibilities and office work forced me to call it a day, years ago, she added.
Ms Nazia told this scribe that she even changed her contact numbers and glided into a complete hibernation but of late sliced out time for social media to watch clips of her old TV plays and it rekindled a spark in her to revisit her decision and rejoined her once favourite showbiz career.
“During all this time, I felt as if I was imprisoned in a cage and at times even sensed being chocked. Watching my old clips of TV plays on social media once again dragged me into my past and at last the nostalgia sparked a spirit within me to rethink comeback,” she stated.
The artist said though much water had gone under the bridge yet she hoped that she would reclaim her fans’ attention through the strength of mature drama role. She said that comedy role was not her forte and seasoned former producers including Masood Ahmad Shah, Ejaz Ahmad Niaz and Jahanzeb Suhail had made her perform well.
“Playwrights like late Mohammad Azam and Noorul Bashar Naveed were my favourite writers. Script and storylines written by them were true reflection of our society. I still cherished their vision and mastery over TV play,” the artist recalled.

The event, titled ‘Da Manray Gul (apple flower in Pashto), was attended by a large number of poets, writers, farmers, and notables from parts of the province.
The speakers said the poets of Waziristan had always highlighted the problems of locals and raised voice for their rights.
They said local musical bands played a significant role in the restoration of peace in the region despite unfavourable conditions.
Around 50 noted Pashto poets participated in the event, which was held to send out a message to the world that the people of Waziristan love peace, festivities, and a green environment, according to local poet Hamid Jan Wazir.
He said the mushaira was organised under the auspices of Wana Pashto Adabi Tolana to mark apple blossom time in the area and raise public awareness to help farmers grow apples and increase production.
Poets Umar Shah Koti, Karwan, Zafar Khan Wazir, Baitullah Bait, and Zindawar received applause from the audience over their inspirational verses.
Some Pashto bards flew in from the Gulf to participate in the event.
Amin Jan Wazir, president of Wana Waziristan Adabi Tolana, pointed out that Waziristan was the land of quality fruits, including apples, and had literary and cultural diversity, with poets advocating for peace, resilience, and national unity.
He said Wana, Birmal, Azmakwarsak, Kaloti, Ghowa, Kari Kot, Kalosha, Kaza Panga, Landi Doaq and Zeer Ghowaza were known for fruit production.
Mr Wazir said over 300 apple growers were trained in ways and means to increase production.
He said most local growers sent apples to other parts of the country to meet the demands of consumers. He said the residents mostly depended on apple production to earn a “humble” livelihood.
NIsar Khan Wazir aka Nisar Lala, patron-in-chief of WPAT, said folk literature had references to rituals that used to celebrate the local flora and fauna, stressing the poets to continue adoring the natural beauty and environment to avoid the hazards of climate change.
Later, the poets read out poems highlighting various aspects of the apple blossom time in its historical perspective and linked the annual celebrations to people’s love for peace, hospitality and nature.

The CLEAN is an environmental analysis facility in Pakistan equipped with state-of-the-art analytical equipment, specialising in air, water, and soil analysis.
Pak-EPA said that CLEAN Laboratory had been providing accurate and reliable environmental data to support regulatory compliance, research projects, and environmental management efforts.
The addition of advanced Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) technology was a powerful tool used to detect and measure small amounts of elements and metals in various types of samples. It helped to explore different environmental materials with great accuracy and speed.

Says ICP-OES technology a powerful tool used to detect small amounts of elements and metals in various types of samples

“Today marks a momentous occasion for Pak-EPA,” stated Pak-EPA Director General Farzana Altaf Shah, alongside Lab/National Environment Quality Standards (NEQS) Director Dr Zaigham Abbas.
The acquisition of the ICP-OES instrument would revolutionise Pak-EPA’s environmental analysis capabilities, enabling the watchdog to delve deeper into environmental samples and provide important information about pollution levels and environmental health.
Pak-EPA said that ICP-OES was a versatile analytical technique for environmental analysis, detecting heavy metal contamination in soil, water, and air samples at levels as low as parts per billion (ppb).
It also analysed nutrient levels in agricultural and ecological samples and assessed the metal content of industrial effluents. With its multi-element capability, low detection limits, and wide dynamic range, ICP-OES offers efficient and sensitive analysis, making it indispensable for environmental research and management.
In its inaugural operation, the ICP-OES instrument at CLEAN Laboratory analysed a batch of 140 samples of wastewater from the textile industry, further underscoring its efficacy in real-world environmental monitoring applications.
“Leveraging this technology, we are excited to announce that our new ICP-OES machine has successfully analysed samples of wastewater from textile industries,” Ms Shah said.
As Pakistan’s top environmental analysis facility, CLEAN Lab has been providing innovative solutions and scientific expertise to tackle environmental challenges.
With the new ICP-OES technology, the Directorate of Lab/NEQS continued to make progress in environmental research and analysis, setting new standards for excellence in environmental monitoring.

During a news conference at the Bara Press Club, the elders said it was a matter of serious concern that the armed supporters of both tribes had put up bunkers in the Sheen Kamar area, where the disputed land was located, in the presence of a number of security checkposts.
They said the two tribes had fought fierce gun battles against each other in the recent past claiming some lives but neither the district administration nor the security forces tried to disarm them to prevent future clashes.
The elders said the region’s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa led to the introduction of the judicial system and the extension of all laws there, but ironically, authorities didn’t take measures to prevent armed clashes and resolve the land dispute between the two tribes in line with the law.
They said the tribesmen were disappointed in the district administration due to the lack of its action on the matter and could stop cooperating with it for the resolution of tribal disputes.
The Malakdinkhel elders alleged that Kamarkhels violated the ceasefire agreement that came at the intervention of a local jirga.
They added that their construction material was taken by the rival tribesmen, who also demolished some of their rooms.
The elders demanded that the police and district administration immediately recover that material for handover to Malakdinkhels. 
KILLED: Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested the suspected killer of a six-year-old boy in the Lala Cheena area of Jamrud tehsil here.
SP (investigation) Kamal Hussain, who headed the investigation team, said Zakriya was allegedly killed by his teenage cousin, Nadeem, over a family dispute.
He said the accused had confessed to drowning his cousin in a small pool after tying up his hands.
The SP said the police sent the boy to the Jamrud sub-jail and began investigation.

16,Financial package demanded for disaster victims,MANSEHRA: Adviser to the chief minister on tourism Zahid Chanzeb on Saturday demanded of the provincial government ...,"MANSEHRA: Adviser to the chief minister on tourism Zahid Chanzeb on Saturday demanded of the provincial government to provide the provincial government with a special financial package for mitigating the suffering of the people hit by natural calamities this year.
“Our province, which is still reeling from terrorism, is now battered by climate change, and therefore, the federal government should increase our financial resources so that we can better meet these challenges,” Mr Chanzeb told reporters here.
He expressed condolences over the death of two brothers and their cousin in a lightning strike in Oghi area and said the recent rains caused deaths and damaged public property and therefore, the government was utilising all its resources to the relief of calamity victims.
“The federal government is responsible for developing climate change policies in line with international treaties it has signed, but it is showing apathy towards such issues in the provinces, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.
The aide to the CM said the federal government should not only offer a financial relief package to the province to enable it to deal with damage caused by natural calamities but also give representation to it in the policymaking process under the Carbon-Plus Policy.
He said the province was badly hit by militancy, and therefore, the federal government should clear its dues, especially those for hydropower production, which had been withheld for many years.

18,High court seeks response of UET  in promotion case,Petition challenges criteria for meritorious professor status,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has directed the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Peshawar to respond to the petition of a professor against its eligibility criteria for promotion as a meritorious professor (BPS-22).
A bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Shahid Khan issued the order after a preliminary hearing into a petition of a professor of the civil engineering department, Dr Khan Shahzada, who requested it to declare that he is eligible for the award of the status of meritorious professor as per the mandate of the Higher Education Commission Statutes.
It fixed May 8 for the next hearing, directing the registrar of the UET to file comments about the petition until then.
The bench, however, declined to grant interim relief to the petitioner, who requested to suspend the promotion process until the disposal of his petition.

Petition challenges criteria for meritorious professor status

The petitioner contended that the Meritorious Professor BPS-22 Statutes, 2016, framed by the UET, were in conflict with the HEC Statutes for Promotion.
Lawyer Ziaur Rehman Tajik appeared for the petitioner and insisted that his client had completed the MS degree in earthquake engineering in 2007 and the PhD in structural engineering in 2011.
He added that the petitioner had an excellent teaching, research, and professional record, and had received several certificates for it.
The lawyer said that the petitioner was appointed a lecturer to the University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar’s Bannu and main campus in 2004 and was appointed an associate professor in BPS-20 in Jan 2013.
He added that the registrar of the university issued a notification on March 22, 2024, inviting applications for promotion and award of meritorious professor BPS-22 from the faculty members of the UET Peshawar, with the eligibility criteria mentioned in the notification.
Mr Tajik argued that the petitioner fulfilled the criteria for promotion to the notified post in line with the criteria mentioned in the HEC Meritorious Professor Statutes but was not eligible as per the criteria mentioned in the UET Peshawar’s statutes.
He contended that while the UET statutes mentioned in the eligibility criteria that the applicants should be professors who had spent at least five years in BPS-21 at the university with a PhD degree, while in the HEC statutes, the criteria was that only the professors, who had spent at least two years in BPS-21 at the university with a PhD degree.
The counsel argued that the eligibility criteria mentioned in the notification were discriminatory and a violation of Article 25 of the Constitution.
He added that his client fulfilled the eligibility criteria as per the HEC statutes, and therefore, he should be considered eligible for promotion as a meritorious professor.
Mr Tajik said that a subcommittee of the UET’s senate also recommended changes to the UET statutes in line with those of the HEC’s statutes.
He, however, said that the UET’s senate regretted amendments to the statutes in its meeting on Feb 2, 2023.
The counsel requested the court to declare discriminatory the decision of the UET’s senate against making the required changes to the statutes.

21,"A welcome rain for some, troublesome for others",Downpour may help address water shortage in summer,"KHYBER: While the district administration is carrying out damage assessment after last week’s torrential rains, residents celebrate the flowing of water in the streams that had dried up decades ago as well as the “emergence” of waterfalls at some places.
Nature lovers, especially youth, from the adjoining areas of Peshawar, Shabqadar, Momand, and even Nowshera are thronging the picturesque spots in Khyber Pass.
Large crowds of visitors are reported at downpour-created waterfalls in Mazreena hilly area of Sultankhel and two on the roadside between Landi Kotal Bazaar and the historical Michni checkpoint.
The dry terrain of Ashkhel in Landi Kotal, which also turned “green” due to the recent rains, as well as the narrow streams of excess rainwater flowing around, are also attracting picnickers.

Downpour may help address water shortage in summer

The surroundings of Ashkhel plateau, along with steep places near waterfalls on the road to Torkham and Mazreena, were filled with the mouth-watering aroma of barbecue arranged by groups of visitors amid music and traditional dances.
Shahid Khan, 22, went all the way from Shabqadar area in Charsadda district to the Mazreena fall along with friends after seeing social media videos of the waterfall.
“It’s really wonderful and a befitting return of our money we spent on the fuel to come here,” he told Dawn at the bottom of the waterfall, taking selfies with friends.
They brought chapli kebab, soft drinks, and snacks along from Peshawar for lunch.
Zahidullah, 18-year-old resident of Mirdadkhel village in Landi Kotal, said for the first time he saw waterfalls in Landi Kotal, which recorded less rainfall than normal.
He said he had a wonderful Eid with his schoolmates visiting rain-induced waterfalls, Ashkhel, and the surrounding hilly areas that turned very attractive after the recent heavy rains.
“Hills in the surrounding localities were very dry at the beginning of this spring due to little rainfall but they turned green all of a sudden after the downpour,” he said.
Food outlets in Landi Kotal Bazaar reported high sales due to the influx of locals as well as tourists.
The local elders and some clerics have a complaint about the spike in visitor arrivals, especially from outside the region.
During a jirga in the Ashkhel area, they demanded a ban on the playing of music at the local picnic spots. The participants also urged the young joy-seekers to desist from activities that go against the local culture.
They told Dawn that they were not opposed to “healthy” entertainment and would continue to welcome and respect all those from outside the region as guests.
The residents of Landi Kotal and adjoining localities complained about scanty rainfall in the last several months and said the region was hit by an acute shortage of drinking water because, firstly, the water table was depleting fast and, secondly, there was no proper strategy to conserve rainwater.
They, however, said last week’s heavy rainfall had addressed the longstanding water issue for a good time.
Azmat Ali, a Khugakhel resident, told Dawn that almost all natural wells, along with dug-up wells, were full to the brim after the recent heavy rains.
“Though the downpour destroyed many houses and brought misery to many residents, it certainly will help address the shortage of drinking water in the approaching summer season,” he said.
Another resident, Sudhir Ahmad Afridi, advocated the construction of barani dams to conserve rainwater and utilise it when the need arises.
