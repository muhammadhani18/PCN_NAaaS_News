0,EV dealers call for incentives,Say EVs offer advantages despite initial cost that can be mitigated via localisation,"Out of a total of 34 brands of Electric Vehicle (EV) two and three-wheelers, almost 20 have introduced newer models, catering to all age groups. Sales volumes have improved following a lacklustre period during Ramazan.
The Engineering Development Board (EDB) has granted licenses to 34 EV bike companies, including those manufacturing electric rickshaws. While all are operational, 20 have displayed their units in showrooms, attracting local customers to well-decorated and well-maintained spaces showcasing more appealing, comfortable, and up-to-date models.
EV dealers explained that they are reassuring customers that they won’t experience any regret or disappointment after purchasing an EV bike. They often chant the slogan “Mehnga Roye Ek Baar, Saastaa Roye Baar Baar!” (Expensive items may sting at the time of purchase, but a cheap product can lead to perpetual headaches.)
In the blink of an eye, people may grasp the main difference between both types of motorbikes. However, unfortunately, market leaders of fuel-powered motorbikes have ingrained serious misconceptions in the minds of customers regarding the higher cost, poor local road infrastructure, lack of qualified EV technicians, and the absence of electric stations.
“People are transitioning from fuel motorbikes to EV motorbikes as they once did from basic mobile phones to smartphones. Chinese branded EV bikes are priced between Rs155,000 to Rs360,000 per unit, while Japanese fuel bikes range from Rs157,000 to Rs550,000. Chinese fuel bikes are gradually disappearing from the market. Additionally, EV sport, luxury, and heavy bike models are displayed in various showrooms, priced from Rs550,000 to Rs1.25 million. The attractiveness of EV models and inflation have decreased sales of fuel bikes, including Honda by 15%, Suzuki by 30%-40%, Yamaha by 50%, and various Chinese fuel bike brands by up to 90% in the local market,” stated Auto Sector Expert and dealer Muhammad Sabir Sheikh.
He mentioned that individuals who lead organised lives prefer EV bikes for their low maintenance requirements. However, many careless motorbike riders still lean towards fuel bikes, despite the hefty maintenance costs involved. EV companies offer technical support at the customer’s home if the bike encounters issues. Otherwise, EVs require no maintenance, fuel, oil, or filters.
He stressed the importance of localisation in the EV industry as EV volumes increase.
Eminent Auto Sector Analyst Mashood Khan explained the need for the government to provide incentives to stimulate the EV market. He suggested allowing short-term phase-wise imports of Completely Knocked-Down (CKD) kits or Completely-Built-Up (CBU) units and implementing easy instalment plans through commercial banks or other strategies.
Addressing the challenges of this emerging industry, he pointed out that a long-term policy for kit imports could deplete foreign exchange reserves. Additionally, poor road infrastructure may pose challenges for EV adoption. He stressed the importance of implementing a localisation policy for technology transfer and urged the government to establish R&D (research and development) centres to drive innovation in the EV industry, citing China’s success in this regard.
Furthermore, he highlighted the necessity of improving road infrastructure, ensuring stable electricity supply without fluctuations, and establishing charging station infrastructure, especially considering that a significant portion of the urban population resides in vertical housing arrangements where charging EV bikes may pose additional challenges.
Regarding market dynamics, he noted the significant demand for fuel motorbikes, exceeding two million units per annum. He acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the EV industry’s share of this market but underscored that EV bikes offer advantages despite the initial cost, which could be mitigated through localisation strategies.

1,PSX climbs on better economic prospects,"KSE-100 index surges 1,833 points, or 2.58% WoW, settles at 72,743","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) rallied in a remarkable fashion in the outgoing week when it soared to a new peak around 72,750 points as activity was fuelled by Iranian president’s visit to Pakistan and speculation about the upcoming monetary policy and new loan talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Some other major positive developments on the economic front and the ongoing corporate earnings season also powered the market’s rally during which the KSE-100 index soared over 1,800 points.
A significant increase in Pakistan’s current account surplus, improving foreign direct investment and a surge in investment through the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) gave investors the much-needed confidence in Pakistan’s economy.
As the week commenced on Monday, Pakistan’s stock market rose to a fresh record high, fueled by robust financial results and anticipation ahead of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s monetary policy announcement on April 29.
Next day, the PSX came under selling pressure, which wiped out all the gains made earlier in the day, caused by the weakening global crude oil prices, refinery closure and caution before the monetary policy announcement.
On Wednesday, the index touched a new peak above the 72,000-point mark over improved economic prospects following Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s statement that foreign exchange reserves could reach “anywhere between $9-10 billion” by the end of June.
The market came under slightly downward pressure on Thursday over institutional profit-taking in overbought stocks amid the corporate earnings season.
On Friday, the PSX soared to unprecedented heights with substantial gains of over 750 points on the back of a favourable earnings outlook, speculation ahead of monetary policy meeting and healthy inflows of $182 million through the RDA in March.
Overall, the benchmark KSE-100 index gained 1,833 points, or 2.58% week-on-week (WoW), and closed at 72,743.
JS Global Deputy Head of Research Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his report, wrote that the KSE-100 index reached an all-time high close of 72,742 during the outgoing week, taking WoW gains to nearly 3%.
Average traded volumes rose 32% compared to the previous week while average traded value increased 22%.
Fertiliser stocks were the top performers, he said. The week started with the Iranian president’s visit to Pakistan during which the two countries agreed to increase bilateral trade to $10 billion over the next five years and signed multiple agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for cooperation in different areas.
He pointed out that on the economic front, the current account for March reached a surplus of $619 million, the highest in nine years and the third highest in 20 years.
The increase was primarily due to a 31% month-on-month (MoM) rise in remittances, which typically occurs during Ramazan. Consequently, the current account deficit for 9MFY24 was restricted to just $508 million, an 87% year-on-year (YoY) decline.
Furthermore, SBP data showed that inflows through the RDA rose to $182 million during March, marking a 29% MoM increase. The SBP’s foreign exchange reserves remained stable at nearly $8 billion, the JS deputy research head added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, wrote that market sentiment remained positive throughout the week and the index closed at an all-time high of 72,743 points. The positivity was fuelled by strong performances in certain sectors during the ongoing results season.
Anticipation ahead of monetary policy decision and the IMF executive board meeting next week helped maintain the momentum in the market. Additionally, the arrival of a delegation led by the Iranian president sparked prospects of development cooperation. Meanwhile, FDI hit the highest level since June 2022 at $258 million. During the week, the rupee closed at Rs278.39 against the US dollar, depreciating by Rs0.08, 0.03% WoW.
Sector-wise, positive contributors were fertiliser (562 points), cement (380 points), banks (348 points), exploration and production (201 points) and power (155 points).
Foreign investors bought stocks valuing at $3 million during the week under review compared to net buying of $33.9 million in the previous week.

2,Ethiopian envoy urges Pakistani banks to expand into Addis Ababa,"Ambassador Abdula emphasised that Ethiopian government would facilitate businesses, enhancing bilateral trade","Ambassador of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Jemal Beker Abdula, has urged Pakistani banks to open branches in Addis Ababa for business transactions.
Addressing the business community at the Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FCCI), he emphasised that the Ethiopian government would facilitate businesses, enhancing bilateral trade. Establishing a banking channel is a critical step, which, he believes, would significantly boost trade and aid Pakistani exporters in accessing African markets.
Ethiopian Airlines now connects Karachi and Lahore with Addis Ababa, with plans to extend service to Faisalabad and Sialkot soon, he said. Ethiopia, the envoy highlighted, boasts a 98% green energy production, exporting to neighbouring countries. Moreover, Ethiopia prioritises education, with a literacy rate of 75-80%, and encourages female participation across sectors. He outlined Ethiopia’s focus on producing skilled human resources, with specialized education and vocational training initiatives. Ethiopia, he asserted, offers a conducive environment for investment, with ten industrial parks and a resilient economy.

3,Packaging films firm plans Rs1.47b IPO,Will offer 70.1m shares at minimum price of Rs21 in early May,"International Packaging Films (IPAK) has planned to raise a minimum of Rs1.47 billion through putting on sale its 70.1 million shares at a price starting from Rs21 per share at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) early next month.
PSX’s book building rules allow a maximum 40% increase in the share price to Rs29.40 during bidding from the floor (beginning) price at the two-day initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for the second week of May 2024. The offer of 70.1 million shares is equivalent to 10.1% of the post-IPO paid-up capital of the company.
In a statement, the company announced that it would utilise the proceeds raised from the IPO for early repayment of long-term loans acquired to fund expansion projects, ie, setting up manufacturing facilities for BOPP and BOPET films. The group claims it is the largest flexible films manufacturer and collectively offers a diverse portfolio of packaging solutions, producing BOPP, CPP and BOPET films. It is the first-ever group in Pakistan to provide one-window flexible packaging solutions and is working at three strategically important locations in the country.
IPAK, along with its subsidiaries – Cast Packaging Films, Petpak Films and Global Packaging Films, collectively forms the largest manufacturing group of flexible packaging films in Pakistan, with total nameplate capacity of over 150,000 tons per annum, spread over an area of 50 acres. The stock issue (IPO) is being made through a 100% book building process whereby bidders will place bids for 100% of the issue. However, the successful bidders shall be allocated only 75% of shares and the remaining 25% shall be offered to retail investors.
In case, the retail portion remains unsubscribed, the unsubscribed shares will be allotted to the successful bidders on a pro rata basis. International Packaging Films recorded net sales of Rs19.9 billion in financial year 2023 while its gross margins were 27% and profit before tax stood at Rs2.9 billion.
Net profit of the company was Rs1.6 billion for the year. Its three-year revenue (compound annual growth rate – CAGR) remained at 41%. Apart from catering to the local demand and substituting the imported products, the company also exports its products to North America, Europe, Africa, the Far East and Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, earning foreign exchange for the country.
The statement quoted IPAK Group CEO Naveed Godil as saying that his company was expected to earn $15-20 million through exports in financial year 2024-25.
Arif Habib Ltd (AHL) Chief Executive Shahid Ali Habib said investors had an exciting opportunity to invest in International Packaging Films, Pakistan’s largest manufacturer of flexible packaging films, with three-year revenue (CAGR) of 41% and enticing forward P/E (price-to-earnings) and P/B (price-to-book) multiples of 4.2 times and 0.8 time, respectively.
AHL and AKD Securities have been mandated by IPAK to act as lead manager and joint lead manager, respectively, for raising funds through the IPO.
Established in 2015, the firm initiated work as a green field project to manufacture Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) films through a production line acquired from Bruckner Maschinenbau (Germany).

4,Turkmenistan vows to complete gas project,CEO says TAPI project being advanced strictly in line with global standards,"Ashgabat is committed to completing the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project together with regional countries, remarked TAPI Pipeline Company Limited CEO Muhammetmyrat Amanov.
He said that Turkmenistan had advanced the energy project with a strong commitment and according to the international law, said a press release issued here.
“Turkmenistan is making significant progress on the TAPI natural gas pipeline, which will supply 33 billion cubic metres to South Asia annually,” he said.
Speaking at the Turkmen Energy Investment Forum (TEIF 2024) currently being held in Paris, Amanov highlighted that Turkmenistan’s section of the pipeline had been completed and ongoing discussions to advance the project beyond Turkmenistan were in strict alignment with the international standards.
He said the project envisaged environmental sustainability by leveraging natural gas to reduce emissions significantly compared to coal and oil, thereby tackling indoor pollution and enhancing regional air quality.
Turkmenistan is implementing the project in strict adherence to the international law, Amanov stressed. “In light of the ongoing project developments, Turkmenistan remains committed to upholding the international law, fulfilling its obligations and adhering to international norms and regulations.” This approach reaffirms Turkmenistan’s dedication to global cooperation and legal integrity in executing the TAPI project.
Looking ahead, the project’s focus is shifting to the Herat Offtake Strategy in Afghanistan, which will play a critical role in environmental protection by reducing air pollution, while also contributing to maintaining public safety, he said.
The company CEO said it would provide early revenue streams and increase the confidence of lenders.

5,"Agripreneur successfully trains 1,000 women",Consortium effort equips women in rural regions with skills for sustainable livelihoods,"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. A consortium comprising a leading foreign bank, a foreign trust, and two local organisations has trained approximately 1,000 women over the past four years, striving to empower them to earn their livelihoods under the project called Agripreneur.
They embarked on an extensive exercise to identify women willing to participate in the months-long training programme from rural and peri-urban regions of Sindh and Punjab, including Pindi, Taxila, and Islamabad.
The programme educated them on drying vegetables using solar machines to increase the shelf life of products without adding preservatives and other chemicals, packaging them attractively, and selling them in the market to earn a living.
Moreover, many women were taught basic accounting to manage their enterprises and opened bank accounts. Initially, the earnings of these young entrepreneurs are modest on average.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Bilquis Tahira, Executive Director at Shirakat, stated that while they have trained the women, the agripreneurs are yet to scale up their businesses to achieve true commercial success and generate enough income to cover most expenses from their vegetable drying businesses.
She mentioned that initially, around 120 business interest groups were formed. Seventy-two of them have managed to expand their businesses by finding markets for their products nearby. Each group comprises five members, mostly consisting of four women and one man. Group leaders were elected through democratic voting.
In the year 2020, the Standard Chartered Foundation made a donation to The British Asian Trust (BAT) to support the implementation of the Agripreneur project. It was part of Futuremakers by Standard Chartered, a global initiative to tackle inequality by promoting economic inclusion for disadvantaged young people, including those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The local implementing partners were the Sindh Agriculture & Forestry Workers Organisation (SAFWCO) and the NGO Shirakat.
They provided each group with a solar dryer machine and trained them, as the process for drying each vegetable varies.
Tahira further explained that initially, her NGO marketed the agripreneurs’ products. Later, the entrepreneurs were trained to find markets themselves.
She remains optimistic that many of them will scale up their businesses to a commercial level, considering that hundreds of thousands of women from similar marginalised societies in India and Nepal have successfully commercialised their work and are earning substantial incomes.
Speaking at the closing event, Chief Executive Officer at Standard Chartered Pakistan, Rehan Shaikh, expressed excitement about concluding the programme as part of the wider Futuremakers initiative to empower the next generation to learn, earn, and grow. The project has developed a sustainable pathway for women and youth out of poverty by addressing key barriers to progress, he said.
“The programme will positively impact thousands of people and will have ancillary economic gains for the communities,” said Shaikh.

6,SBP chief boasts of firm response to challenges,"Jameel Ahmad said ""it is worth taking a step back and analyse where our economy is standing and where it is headed""","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad has said that a firm commitment of the government and the SBP to respond to the macroeconomic challenges has resulted in a significant improvement in the economy.
Speaking as a chief guest at the Members Convocation of the ICMA Pakistan, the governor encouraged the graduating accounting professionals to make a mark for themselves. While elaborating on the recent improvement in Pakistan’s economy, Ahmad said “it is worth taking a step back and analyse where our economy is standing and where it is headed”.
A year ago, he shared, Pakistan was facing a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Inflation was as high as 38%, foreign currency reserves were depleting fast, the exchange rate was under a lot of pressure and uncertainty was quite high.
However, “today, inflation is coming down sharply, our reserves have risen to around $8 billion despite heavy debt repayments and will also cross the $9 billion mark, the current account deficit has narrowed quite significantly, and as a result, the rupee is stable.” He stressed that uncertainty had also reduced while Pakistan’s bilateral and multilateral partners were continuing their support and the stock market was touching new highs.
The governor said that the progress was made possible because of a firm commitment of the government and the SBP to effectively respond to the macroeconomic challenges. He pointed out that unpopular, yet necessary measures had to be taken. The SBP raised the policy rate to 22% to reduce pressure on inflation and the current account.

7,Minister condemns fertiliser price hike,Rana stated that fertiliser company must provide solid justification for sudden increases in price of Sarsabz Urea,"Federal Minister for Industries and Production, Rana Tanveer Hussain, condemned the unilateral price hike of Sarsabz Urea fertiliser by Fatima Fertiliser Limited on Saturday.
He expressed deep concern over an increase of Rs561 per urea bag and urged the fertiliser company to withdraw this unilateral increase, said a news release.
The minister stated that the fertiliser company must provide solid justification for sudden increases in the price of Sarsabz Urea.
He highlighted that there has been no increase in gas prices for the fertiliser industry, adding that an increase in the price of urea fertiliser without a corresponding increase in gas prices is unacceptable and unjustified.
Hussain said that in case of failure to provide solid justification, the relevant ministry would determine prices according to the laws.
He highlighted the government’s commitment to protecting farmers’ interests and ensuring the stability of fertiliser prices. Efforts are being made in collaboration with provinces to eliminate hoarding of fertilisers, while mechanisms are being developed to check the availability of real-time stock of fertilisers, he added.

8,PM probes FBR’s Rs25b contract,"Body led by bureaucrat investigates flawed T&T project, despite clearances","A committee led by a top bureaucrat has initiated an inquiry to hold more individuals accountable within the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for awarding a faulty Rs25 billion contract aimed at tracing the production activities of companies. This comes despite another fact-finding body’s conclusion that there was no wrongdoing in the award of the deal.
The committee, headed by Secretary Finance Imdad Ullah Bosal, began its investigation following directives from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif who, a day earlier, denounced the Track & Trace system—an initiative aimed at curbing tax evasion—as a complete fraud against the nation and economy.
This marks the fourth inquiry ordered by Sharif into the Rs25 billion track and trace contract, which was awarded by the government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI). Former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Tariq Bajwa, conducted a previous fact-finding inquiry but found no evidence of malpractice in the contract award.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is also conducting two separate inquiries into the same contract.
The newly-formed four-member committee has been tasked with identifying those responsible for the flawed award and execution of the Track and Trace project. Initially introduced in 2019 to combat tax evasion, the Track & Trace system was first implemented in the cigarette industry before expanding to other sectors such as fertilisers and sugar.
The roles of former and current project directors of the Track and Trace Project are under scrutiny.
This move aligns with the prime minister’s commitment to zero tolerance for corruption and inefficiency within the FBR, and came on the heels of his decision to remove 25 compromised officers from the tax machinery, including one recipient of Tamgha-i-Imtiaz, who had been awarded the honour by Sharif’s previous government.
Sources indicate that the Bosal-led committee held proceedings on Saturday and sought additional information and documents from the FBR to assess the involvement of FBR officers in the flawed project conception, design, and implementation.
In addition to Bosal, the committee comprises Nauman Khalid, Member Technology CDA; Babar Najeeb Bhatti, CEO of the National Information Technology Board; and Owais Nauman Kundi, Additional Secretary Law and Justice.
Karamat Chaudhry, Member Digital Initiatives, represented the FBR before the committee.
Earlier, the prime minister had established a fact-finding committee under former governor of SBP Tariq Bajwa. The committee attributed delays and poor implementation of the track and trace project to the FBR, the contractor, and manufacturers. However, it found no evidence of wrongdoing in the contract award. The sources, however, said that the PM was not happy with this finding and decided to set up another committee led by his trust-worthy bureaucrat Imdad Ullah Bosal.
Following a review of the fact-finding committee report, the prime minister has directed the newly constituted inquiry committee to identify those responsible for the shortcomings in project conception, contract design, and implementation by the FBR.
According to a notification from the PM Office, the poor implementation of the project resulted in serious lapses and delays, leading to continued loss of government revenues.
The committee has been tasked with determining responsibility for approving a poorly designed request for proposal for the contract. It will also identify those responsible for signing inefficient and poorly structured Service Delivery Agreements with the contractor, which lacked provisions for third-party audit.
Another task of the committee is to identify the officers accountable for the inordinate delay in forming oversight boards and sectoral committees. Likewise, the committee will investigate why the necessary changes were not implemented in the system to address the issues highlighted by the contractor through change requests.
Furthermore, it will determine accountability for the failure to integrate the tracking system throughout the supply chain.
The PTI government had awarded the estimated Rs25 billion contract to a consortium consisting of M/s AJCL, MITAS, and Authentix, but the system largely remained non-functional. While operational in the tobacco and fertiliser sectors, the track and trace system faced challenges in the sugar and cement sectors. Counterfeit stamps were even discovered on cigarette packaging within the tobacco sector.
The consortium led by AJCL won the contract based on the highest technical score, despite its financial bid being 52% higher than the lowest bid. The price difference between the lowest financial bid of Rs499 per thousand stamps and the second highest bid offered by the consortium of AJCL Private Limited was Rs259 per thousand stamps.
This resulted in an additional payment of Rs8.5 billion to the bidder over the five-year contract period. The total estimated five-year contract value was Rs25 billion. The five-year contract can be extended by another three years, taking the total additional financial impact to Rs13.5 billion.
Former prime minister Imran Khan inaugurated the Track and Trace system in 2021 for electronic monitoring of manufacturing and sales in important sectors such as tobacco, fertilisers, sugar, and cement.

9,PM seeks probe into reduction in gas supplies,Delay in $600m payment prompts E&P companies to slash output,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered probe into the curtailment of gas supply to the public gas utilities because of delay in payments.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the premier intervened as payables of the gas utilities had mounted to $600 million, which they had to pay to foreign oil and gas exploration companies.
Earlier, an association of oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) firms had taken up the matter with the Petroleum Division, seeking its immediate resolution. Sources said that E&P companies informed the Petroleum Division that supply of 150 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd) had been curtailed owing to the payment issues. However, now it has emerged that the volume of curtailed gas has been increased to 300 mmcfd.
E&P companies have told the federal government that the payables of gas utilities to foreign firms have surged to $600 million and called for allocating a tariff differential subsidy of Rs75 billion to avert the collapse of Pakistan’s upstream petroleum sector.
In a letter written to the petroleum minister, the Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Companies Association claimed that preference was being given to liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports instead of ramping up efforts for gas exploration in the country. It argued that delayed payments were becoming a significant barrier to the ability of upstream companies to pump investment into their assets. “This issue has resulted in a reduction of 300 mmcfd of gas supply due to low drilling activities.”
The association called for taking different measures to stave off the collapse of Pakistan’s upstream petroleum sector. It sought a budgetary grant or tariff differential subsidy of at least Rs75 billion for Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) for partially bridging the accumulated revenue shortfall.
The subsidy will facilitate them in paying the upstream companies, which will, in turn, be able to meet their operating expenditures and carry out planned exploration and development work for sustaining and enhancing oil and gas production in the country.
It asked the government to give directives to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for allocating foreign exchange for payments to foreign E&P companies in an equitable manner.
It also underscored the need for initiating work on underground gas storage facilities to avoid the curtailment of indigenous gas supplies. In the letter, the association drew attention towards a critical situation unfolding in the upstream oil and gas sector.
“Our industry is confronting a complex array of challenges that require urgent action. Foremost among these is the alarming amount of outstanding receivables, which currently stand at a staggering Rs1,500 billion, of which over $600 million is payable to foreign companies.” It pointed out that companies were witnessing a marked decline in domestic oil and gas production, with the shortfall being balanced by costly energy imports, especially LNG, resulting in growing energy shortages.
