0,Foreign talent to make up for ‘unskilled’ bureaucrats,Cabinet relaxes public procurement legal framework,"The federal cabinet has relaxed the public procurement legal framework to hire foreign consultancy firms to strengthen the hands of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) in preparations for investment projects for the Gulf countries.
The foreign consultancy firms will be hired for a period of five years as a replacement for Pakistani bureaucrats who are found lacking in project planning and execution, according to government sources.
However, the decision will reflect poorly on the working of the bureaucracy, which could not provide quality assistance to the SIFC. The cabinet has approved a summary through circulation on the advice of the SIFC, which recommended granting exemption due to the poor capacity of Pakistan’s federal bureaucracy, confirmed a senior government official on Saturday.
In case of circulation, the summary is approved without discussion in the regular cabinet meeting.
The sources said that due to an incapacitated bureaucracy, Pakistan was struggling to prepare projects for investment by Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Kuwait. The development came a week after Pakistan offered highly lucrative returns to Saudi Arabia for getting a $5 billion investment.
Pakistan has presented the enticing prospect of highly profitable returns to attract Saudi investment, with projected rates ranging from an appealing 14% to an astounding 50%.
The maximum 50% return on the investment has been indicated for the Greenfield Mine Development, Khuzdar, project, which is said to be the third largest mining project after Reko Diq and Thar coal, according to the sources.
The government was jubilant over its presentation to the Saudi delegation, which appreciated Islamabad’s preparedness compared to the past. However, the bureaucracy is not trained in certain skills and compared to the Pakistani delegation the Saudi Arabian delegation was far better prepared.
One of the reasons for the lack of effective and efficient bureaucracy is that generalists are appointed as the secretaries of the economic ministries.
These bureaucrats, mostly Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) officers, get expertise on the job and then they are moved to any other ministry.
A federal secretary can at any time be appointed as secretary of finance, secretary of power, secretary planning, secretary board of investment and secretary of petroleum without a requisite set of expertise.
Until recently, a federal secretary held positions as Secretary of the Board of Investment, then Secretary of Industry, and later served a brief tenure as secretary power before transitioning to the PM's Office.
Similarly, in another case, the secretary education was posted as the secretary industry.
The federal cabinet approved a special procurement process for the Programme for Engagement of Top Consulting Firms, according to the Cabinet Division officials.
They said that an executive committee of the SIFC this week had recommended seeking an exemption of the procurement processes defined under the PPRA Ordinance and the rules and regulations to go for emergency hiring of foreign consulting firms.
The SIFC executive committee deliberated upon the Special Programme for top foreign talent hiring.
It, in the national interest, recommended to the federal government, that under section 10F of the Board of Investment Ordinance 2001, an exemption be granted for the special procurement process for the 5-Year Programme for Hiring Top Quality Consultants, from the applicable legal framework under the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has in the past raised concerns over the SIFC’s special powers to exempt any project or procurement from the PPRA law and rules.
However, Pakistani authorities are of the view that the country cannot afford to spend four to six months just to hire consultants and that they have to take a fast-track route to get this technical expertise on priority.
After relaxing the legal framework, the foreign consulting firms will be governed by the framework recommended by SIFC for approval of the federal cabinet, as well as any additional procedures approved for the Special Programme by the Special Joint Committee on Consulting Support.
Pakistan on Friday decided to hire Mackenzie International for the digitisation of the FBR but the firm would be paid by the Bills and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The sources said that PM Shehbaz Sharif wanted to further improve the project preparation process and directed to secure the approval of the cabinet through circulation.
The foreign talent will be made available to any ministry of the federal government as well as the Board of Investment, the SIFC and the Public Private Partnership Authority. The programme will be in place for a period of five years from the date of approval by the federal government.

1,Underperforming judges should be ‘shown the door’,Justice Shah concedes ‘dark patches’ in judicial history,"Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah on Saturday minced no words when he suggested that the judges, who were not performing well, should be shown the door.
“We should not compromise on corrupt and underperforming judges,” he observed during his keynote speech at the two-day 5th edition of the Asma Jahangir Conference, titled ‘People’s Mandate: Safeguarding Civil Rights in South Asia’ organised in Lahore.
“The courts must adopt the new age of information technology to create a smart dashboard of cases, change the judges’ appointment process where “sifarish” [nepotism] is not entertained and the method through which new [ones] are appointed is rigorous,” he noted.
The SC judge acknowledged that there have been “dark patches” in the country’s judicial history and he was not proud of that
“The judiciary must be transformed into a robust institution,” he remarked.
He added that the judiciary was working with 4,000 judges in the country deciding cases every day. “But most of [these] judgments are not credible. The system is dysfunctional. It is sluggish and needs to be made expeditious.”
The SC judge pointed out that presently there were more than two million pending cases in the country.
“Currently, Pakistan’s judiciary is ranked 132rd in the world,” he added.
He continued that he would not call this number of the country’s judiciary one to be proud of.
Justice Shah observed that the country’s lower court judges could not tell them in which case they were facing a problem.
“We have to make our judicial system a data analysis room.”
The SC judge noted that the country would have look at the practice of the world.
He emphasised the need to have more alternative dispute resolution (ADR) centres in the country’s courts.
In Justice Shah’s opinion, the “best thing” to happen in the country’s judicial system was the SC Practice and Procedure Act, whereby a three-judge committee decides the formation of benches and the scheduling of cases.
“It is a commendable improvement. We have to work towards leaving no room for individual adventurism.”
The SC judge highlighted that there could not be any outside interference in the judiciary’s affairs. “Building a firewall around the judicial system is very important [to prevent that],” he noted.
Justice Shah’s remarks came in the wake of the allegations made by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges in a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council against “interference” in judicial affairs by the intelligence apparatus.
Dated March 25 this year, the letter, signed by IHC Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, outlined seven instances of such alleged interference and intimidation by intelligence officials.
The open letter, copies of which were distributed to all apex court judges, suggested the possibility of a judicial convention to discuss the interference of intelligence operatives with judicial functions and the intimidation of judges, which undermines judicial independence.
During his address, the SC judge highlighted the importance of including women in the judiciary.
“A critical perspective pertaining to women is missing in judiciary. There are only 562 female judges in Pakistan and that’s a number too small.”
He also stressed the need for training judges.

2,IHC recommends strict rules to deter meddling,Suggests initiating misconduct hearing against judges failing to report meddling incidents,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has proposed that in the event of any meddling in the judiciary by state institutions, the relevant high court should take institutional measures, while contempt proceedings may also be initiated against such meddlers.
The court also recommended that any judge facing pressure from any quarter should report this within seven days of its occurrence to the inspection judge of the relevant high court. Failure to report an instance of meddling by a judge should be construed as misconduct.
According to sources within the capital’s high court, the IHC has made these recommendations in a report submitted to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The apex court had sought proposals from high courts on how to protect the independence of the judiciary from the “interference” of agencies.
A larger bench of the Supreme Court is currently hearing a suo motu case initiated in view of a letter sent by six of the eight IHC judges to the Supreme Judicial Council on March 25, highlighting the coercive measures allegedly employed by the country’s spy agencies to pressure judges of high and lower courts.
The proposals were formulated in a full court meeting of the IHC held on April 23. In the meeting, all the IHC judges unanimously acknowledged that agencies were “interfering” in their judicial functions.
According to sources, a draft code of conduct for judges has also been included as a recommendation by the IHC. The proposed code of conduct comprises six to seven pages.
The IHC judges have suggested that there should be an immediate institutional response to any interference, with the reporting of any such interference being mandatory within seven days.
It has been stated in the recommendation that failure to report interference within seven days would be considered misconduct. Sessions judges, additional sessions judges, and high court judges will notify the relevant high court’s inspection judge about the interference.
The inspection judge will bring the matter to the attention of the chief justice of the high court. The high court administrative committee will decide whether to address the matter administratively or judicially based on the severity of the interference.
The committee may also refer the matter to the full court based on the gravity of the issue. The high court can exercise its authority to punish such meddlers by initiating contempt of court proceedings.
Other provincial high courts have also held full court meetings in view of the SC’s order and are submitting their input on the question of interference of state institutions in judicial matters.

3,KBA echoes IHC stance; seeks agency scrutiny,Petition urged apex court to ensure that state institutions do not transgress their lawful domain,"Supporting the stance of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges regarding interference of agencies in judicial functions, the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) has requested the Supreme Court to direct the federal government to devise appropriate mechanisms for effective scrutiny and oversight of agencies.
It has also urged the apex court to ensure that state institutions do not transgress their lawful domain and that intelligence agencies are duly regulated through requisite legislation.
""It is high time that the observations and directions made by this court in, inter alia, the Air Marshal (retd) Asghar Khan case and the Faizabad Dharna case regarding the effective monitoring and regulation of intelligence agencies be implemented in letter and spirit,” said the KBA petition.
The petition moved through Salahuddin Ahmed advocate said intelligence agencies cannot continue to operate in a legal vacuum and with unchecked powers sans any effective executive or legislative oversight or accountability.
It said the distressing nature of allegations raised in the letter by IHC judges militate for an independent and impartial inquiry especially when coupled with the past history of unlawful intrusions by the executive in judicial affairs as recorded in numerous SC judgments.
""It is not a one-off incident but a deliberate pattern of harassment, intimidation and pressurization of the judiciary which has, hitherto, gone unchecked.
“In the circumstances, any inquiry must be conducted by this court directly or, alternatively, through a commission appointed by, and reporting to, this court as per terms of reference settled by this court.""
The petition states that the judiciary stands between the people and any excesses of the executive, as the executive often oversteps its bounds.
""If the judiciary is unable to do so, and instead itself becomes a victim of the excesses of the executive, then any faith in the judiciary shall be whittled away.
It said in the Iftikhar Chaudhry case, the court held that since access to justice was inconceivable in the absence of an independent judiciary guaranteeing impartial, fair and a just adjudicatory mechanism, therefore, the demand for judiciary which was free of executive influence and pressures was also an integral part and an indispensable ingredient” of Article 9 of the Constitution.
It said the petition also invokes Article 4 of the Constitution, which provides that any action “detrimental to the life, body and reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law” and a coerced, threatened and intimidated judiciary is necessarily unable to keep in check unlawful executive actions""
Referring to Article 203 of the Constitution which says that each high court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it, it said this supervision is entirely illusory if judges’ homes are being invaded with incendiary devices or if judges are being summoned to some spy agency’s office.
“As such, the high courts are under obligation to develop institutional mechanisms and protocols for preventing intrusions into judicial affairs of all courts subordinate to them and to revise their respective codes of conduct for judicial officers and staff of courts subordinate to them.
""External judicial independence is undermined because external actors can more easily influence the court and its verdicts if they only have to secure the cooperation of one person – whether through fear or favour,” it said.

4,Saudi leadership backs PM's proactive vision,"‘Your mission is our mission,’ Investment Minister Al-Falih tells Shehbaz; describes him ‘man of action’","The Saudi Arabia’s leadership and investors conveyed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday that their commitment to the development and advancement of Pakistan aligned closely with his own, hailing his proactive leadership as exemplary.
During a packed schedule in Riyadh, the prime minister engaged with various dignitaries, holding discussions with a cohort of Saudi ministers and a delegation of investors from Saudi Arabia, besides talks with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
During these meetings on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Saudi ministers and investors told Shehbaz that his mission of the development and progress of Pakistan was a mission of their own, as they praised his leadership by terming him the “man of action”.
Shehbaz held separate meetings with Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih, Finance Minister Mohammad Al Jadaan, Industry Minister Bandar bin Ibrahim Alkhourayef and Adviser at the Royal Court and General Secretary of Saudi-Pak Supreme Coordination Council Mohammed bin Mazyad Al-Tuwaijri.
