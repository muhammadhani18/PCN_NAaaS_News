JERUSALEM: Hamas on Saturday said it was studying the latest Israeli counter proposal regarding a potential ceasefire in Gaza, a day after a delegation from mediator Egypt reportedly arrived in Israel in a bid to jump-start stalled negotiations.
The signs of fresh truce talks came alongside ongoing Israeli preparations for a military push into Gaza’s southern city of Rafah.
“Today, the Hamas movement received the official Zionist occupation response to the movement’s position, which was delivered to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators on April 13,” Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas’s political arm in Gaza, said in a brief statement early Saturday.
“The movement will study this proposal, and upon completion of its study, it will submit its response.”

Fresh strikes around Rafah before planned incursion

Hamas had previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire, something rejected by Israel.
Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been unsuccessfully trying to seal a new truce deal in Gaza ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli prisoners exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Discussions over Gaza
The war in Gaza was also on the agenda for an international summit set to kick off in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
The World Economic Forum special meeting, scheduled to begin in Riyadh on Sunday, will include a Gaza-focused session on Monday set to feature newly appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip.
Witnesses in besieged Gaza reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight into Saturday around Rafah, the last urban centre Israeli ground forces have yet to enter.
Plans for an Israeli incursion into the city, which military leaders say is necessary to uproot Hamas, have sparked opposition among the international community due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians seeking refuge there.
Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP on Thursday that such an operation “will undoubtedly threaten the negotiations” and show “that Israel is interested in continuing the war”.
The Israeli strikes resulted in the death of about 34,356 people in Gaza, mostly women and children.
On Friday, missiles fired from an Israeli jet hit Gaza City, killing at least three people in the Rimal neighbourhood, an AFP reporter said.
‘Hands off Rafah’
Opposition to an Israeli military operation in Rafah extended to university campuses across the US, where hundreds of students have been arrested at pro-Palestinian protests.
“Stop the invasion! Hands off Rafah!” said a sign at a pro-Palestinian encampment at George Washington University in the US capital.
Israel minister in crash
The Israeli army said Friday that a civilian was killed by anti-tank missiles fired towards “the area of Har Dov”, which refers to the disputed Shebaa Farms border district.
Also on Friday, the Lebanese Islamist group Jamaa Islamiya said an Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon had killed two of its senior commanders.
In response to what it called a “cowardly assassination”, Hezbollah said it launched dozens of rockets at two military posts in northern Israel.
In the Red Sea, a tanker was damaged when it was targeted with multiple missiles off Yemen’s coast on Friday.
Near Tel Aviv, an 18-year-old woman was seriously wounded in a stabbing attack and the assailant was killed at the scene, according to paramedics and police.
After addressing journalists at the scene, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was involved in a car crash in which three people were lightly injured, police said.

1,Transporters threaten highway blockade in Balochistan,"Demand cancellation of new SOPs, removal of checkpoints.","QUETTA: The striking transporters, who had suspended operations on the Quetta-Taftan and other routes for the last one week, demanding the cancellation of new SOPs and the removal of newly established checkpoints following the tragic incident in Noshki, have threatened to block all national highways linking Balochistan with other provinces if their demands are not met within the next 48 hours.
The provincial government had taken serious notice of the Noshki incident, in which nine people from Punjab province were gunned down by unknown armed men after being kidnapped from a Taftan-bound passenger bus. These victims were en route to European countries via Iran and Iraq.
In response, the government decided to reassess its security plan to ensure safe travel on national highways.
As part of the revised security plan, the provincial government decided to reinstate security checkpoints on the Quetta-Taftan, Quetta-Karachi, coastal highway, and other routes.

Demand cancellation of new SOPs, removal of checkpoints

Additionally, SOPs were developed for bus owners operating coaches and buses to ensure passenger safety.
Thess SOPs included arranging at least two security guards in every coach and bus and maintaining a record of passengers with their national identity cards.
According to the SOPs issued to the transporters running coaches and buses on the Quetta-Taftan section and coastal highway, they were instructed not to allow passengers who travel with passports and visas.
The checkpoints reinstated at various routes had been removed by previous governments following demands from coalition partners, political parties, and human rights organisations.
These groups argued that security forces, including Customs, Fro­ntier Corps, Levies, and Coast Guards humiliated passengers und­er the pretext of security checks.
Representatives of the All Quetta-Taftan, Dalbandin, Chagai, Mashkel, Saindak and Rakhsan Bus Transport Union Alliance termed the new SOPs one-sided. They stated that the authorities concerned did not consult with the transporters’ union alliance, which they find unacceptable.
“The SOPs imposed by the government for transporters are very strict and not feasible for the bus owners,” said Lala Saeed Jan Lehri, a representative of the transporters’ union alliance, spe­aking at a press conference last week along with other transporters.
He emphasised that transporters had been operating buses and coaches on these routes for the last 40 years, with passengers travelling with passports and visas for various countries via Iran, Iraq, and Turkiye being their main source of income.
He also pointed out that buses were being checked at all checkpoints despite initial checks at the entry point in Taftan, causing difficulties for passenger transporters.
“Checks should be conducted at a checkpoint at the first entry point,” Mr Lehri added.
The striking transporters’ spokesman said that security on highways was the responsibility of the state and the government.
He warned that if the transporters’ demands were not met within the next 48 hours, they would block all national highways, suspending all traffic until their demands are accepted.
A spokesman for the Balochistan government said that steps had been taken by the authorities concerned to ensure the safety of passengers travelling on these routes in coaches and buses.
“We already provide security to pilgrims travelling for ziarats to Iran and Iraq. They travel in a security convoy,” he said.

2,Skardu-Dubai regular flights to begin from tomorrow,"PIA to operate flights, with the first departure from Skardu to Dubai on April 29 and the first arrival on May 4.","GILGIT: Regular international flights between Skardu and Dubai will commence on Monday, with two weekly flights operating on Monday and Friday.
According to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) will operate these flights, with the first departure from Skardu to Dubai on April 29 and the first arrival on May 4.
The move to start regular weekly flights has come after the milestone of last year when a total of 11 flights were operated between Skardu and Dubai on different occasions.
The Skardu airport, declared ‘international’ by former prime minister Imran Khan in December 2021, is the only airport in northern Pakistan capable of accommodating larger airplanes.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Faisal Niaz Tirmizi confirmed to Dawn that PIA has been requested to initiate regular flights between Skardu and Dubai.
The improved accessibility is expected to attract more visitors to Skardu and its surrounding areas, known for their stunning landscapes and natural beauty.
GB Minister for Plan­n­ing and Development Raja Nasir Ali Khan met PIA’s chief commercial officer Nausherwan Adil to discuss strategies for enhancing air connectivity and promoting tourism.
They agreed to increase flight frequencies from Dubai to Skardu and launch direct special flig­hts from Skardu to Najaf and Damascus for pilgrims, the minister told Dawn.
In the meeting, he said, they also discussed initiating direct Hajj and Umrah flights from Skardu airport, which would benefit local residents and promote international tourism, positively impacting the local economy.

3,Global operators eye bid for Islamabad airport management,"Meeting, chaired by Ishaq Dar, reviews market-sounding efforts for outsourcing airports through Pakistan’s diplomatic missions.","ISLAMABAD: Renowned airport operators from around the world have expressed their interest in bidding for the management of the Islamabad International Airport.
The development came to light during an online meeting chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday. The meeting, which was attended by Pakistani envoys, reviewed market-sounding efforts for outsourcing airports through Pakistan’s diplomatic missions.
 






According to a press release, Aviation Secretary Saif Anjum, who is also the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), reported positive feedback from Pakistani missions in countries such as Turkiye, Malaysia, the UAE, Qatar, France, Spain, Germany, Kuwait, the UK, and Switzerland.
These efforts have led to a reinvigorated interest among top-tier airport operators, the press release said.
Operators of foreign airports, it said, “had shown positive interests in the bidding of the Isla­mabad International Airport”.
The meeting was followed by the 9th steering committee session on airport outsourcing, which was attended by key government officials, including the secretary of law and justice, the additional secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and heads of various federal agencies.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) also presented a progress review report, noting a keen interest and expected healthy competition among foreign investors for the Islamabad airport project.
During the session, the forum reviewed key performance indicators and service delivery benchmarks established by international consultants to enhance the quality of services at airports across Pakistan.
The government agency heads committed to observing these benchmarks to ensure a seamless passenger experience.
Mr Dar stressed the importance of expediting the outsourcing processes for Lahore and Karachi airports within the stipulated time frames, underlining the government’s commitment to enhancing economic diplomacy and strengthening trade and investment ties with other nations.

4,Justice Sattar’s recusal sought from audio leak case,Pemra files plea as IHC scheduled to resume hearing on Monday.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pa­k­­­istan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has requested Justice Babar Sattar of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to recuse himself from hearing the audio leak case.
Pemra, a party in the audio leak case, submitted a miscellaneous application before the IHC as the court is scheduled to resume hearing on Monday (tomorrow).
In the application, the electronic media watchdog contended that since another IHC bench had already dealt with an identical matter, Justice Sattar should recuse himself so that the same bench that had issued an order in the same matter may proceed on the petitions in hand.
Justice Sattar was hearing the petitions filed by son of former chief justice Saqib Nisar, Najam Saqib, and spouse of former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi.
Mr Saqib had challenged the inquiry of a parliamentary committee on his alleged audio in which he was seeking bribe for PTI ticket to a politician.
Ms Bibi in her petition challenged the inquiry initiated by the FIA on the basis of her alleged conversation.
Justice Sattar at a hearing had asked the intelligence agencies, Pakistan Telecommunication Autho­rity to trace the source of the audio leak while Pemra was directed not to broadcast the unauthorised and leaked conversation of citizens.
 
 

The state institutions, however, expressed helplessness in coping up with the sensitive issue of privacy breach, as they hold smartphone apps responsible for audio leaks.
Earlier, Pemra chairman Mriza Saleem Baig informed the court that the Council of Complaint has become active and they can take action against any TV channel for airing un­­verified and personal conversation of the citizens.
The IB and the ISI in their reports informed the court that the phone calls could be tapped through mobile apps and viruses. The ISI in its report expressed its inability to trace the source of the leaks, citing encryption as a significant barrier.

5,Film highlights Doha accord failure,Sharp Edge of Peace premiers at Canadian documentary festival,"


 
WASHINGTON: “The film portrays the realities of the US-Taliban talks in Doha, shedding light on how Afghan women were consistently sidelined and ignored throughout the process,” says Horia Mosadiq who saw Sharp Edge of Peace in London.
The feature-length documentary follows the women members of the Afghan government team as they navigate a shared political structure with the Afghan Taliban during the talks held in Doha, Qatar, in 2020.
“Women like us, who resided in Afghanistan, were unjustly labeled warmongers simply because we opposed unconditional surrender,” said Ms Mosadiq, who is now the director of a London-based NGO, Conflict Analysis Network (CAN). It’s a specialised research network focused on conflict and human rights.
“Efforts were made to isolate us diplomatically by instructing other embassies not to engage with us, falsely portraying us as members of an exclusive elite group that doesn’t represent Afghan women,” she added.

Sharp Edge of Peace premiers at Canadian documentary festival

Ms Mosadiq believes “ignoring women always leads to disastrous consequences” like the “rise of a gender-apartheid Taliban regime”.
Like her, the majority of educated Afghans believe that the agreement reached between the Americans and the Afghan Taliban led to a sharp-edged peace that harmed all, as depicted in the film. Afghan women were left in the clutches of a gender apartheid regime, and the nation was once again pushed into darkness.
“Sharp Edge of Peace,” produced and directed by Roya Sadat and her team, portrays the endeavours of four remarkable women leaders — Fatima Gailani, Fawzia Koofi, Habiba Sarabi, and Sharifa Zurmati.
Together, they courageously engage with the Afghan Taliban in Doha, advocating for the recognition of women’s humanity.
“The Taliban displayed minimal interest in women’s arguments, largely due to their awareness of the imminent American withdrawal,” explained Ms Mosadiq. “As anticipated by the Taliban, the Americans indeed packed up and departed.”
She contends that the Americans mistakenly believed they had bestowed upon Afghan women the rights they deserved, and in their rush to withdraw, inflicted “irreparable damage on Afghan women, their rights, and their ongoing struggles”.
The documentary illustrates how Afghan women steadfastly refused to compromise their hard-fought gains for equality in exchange for a hastily brokered peace agreement. It contends that Afghan wars have transcended national boundaries for generations, and the Doha negotiations were no exception, with numerous stakeholders each pursuing their own agendas.
In this complex tapestry of interests, attaining peace necessitates the involvement of all parties at the negotiation table.
The film commences with a powerful scene portraying Ms Koofi, a former parliamentarian and advocate for women’s rights, courageously recovering in a hospital bed following an assassination attempt in August 2020. She remains committed to advocating for Afghan women’s rights and has established the Afghan Women Coalition for Change with the aim of making gender apartheid an internationally recognized crime against humanity.
Ms Gailani, now chair of Afgha­nistan Future Thought Forum, said the Afghan negotiating team never expected US soldiers or Nato to stay forever and hoped for a smoother transition and political settlement.
Ms Sarabi, another negotiator, highlighted the resilience of Afghan women.
The 95-minute film had its premier at the Canadian film festival on April 27.
