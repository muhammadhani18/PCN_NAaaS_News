3,Hepatitis outbreak baffles locals,LHEAP survey reveals 1 in every 5 residents affected by disease in Fauji Colony," 
Following an alarming rise in hepatitis cases in Rawalpindi’s Fauji Colony area, extensive awareness
and testing initiatives have been launched to shield residents from the growing health threat.
The Local Hepatitis Elimination and Prevention Program (LHEAP) has spearheaded this campaign, introducing testing and vaccination services to diagnose and combat hepatitis effectively.
One of the key focal points has been addressing hygiene lapses in establishments like barbershops, dental clinics, and tyre shops along Bokra Road, a bustling business hub adjoining the affected union council. The officials from the LHEAP program have taken swift action, sealing off eleven barber shops, a dental clinic, and a tyre shop in response to their use of non-sterilized tools. 
This crackdown is part of a broader effort to enforce cleanliness protocols and mitigate the spread of hepatitis within the community. The prevalence of hepatitis in Fauji Colony has been alarming, with roughly one in every five or six residents affected by the disease, according to LHEAP’s assessments.
Poor hygiene practices among residents and the negligence of cleanliness standards in local establishments have exacerbated the situation. A pivotal aspect of the campaign has been community engagement,
exemplified by the formation of a support group under the LHEAP programme.
One such gathering drew fifty women, who were educated about preventive measures against hepatitis B and C, along with guidance on treatment options for those afflicted. Complimentary services, including free hepatitis testing and vaccinations, were provided post-discussion, emphasising the programme’s holistic approach to combatting
hepatitis.
LHEAP CEO Dr Ansar Ishaq highlighted the programme’s strategic focus on Fauji Colony in Union Council 8, chosen based on surveys indicating a spike in hepatitis cases in the area.
Factors like inadequate access to clean water and poor hygiene practices among the densely populated populace have been identified as major contributors to the escalating infections. The programme’s initiatives include ongoing awareness campaigns, free testing, and treatment for hepatitis C patients, all made possible through collaborative efforts with self-help groups and philanthropic support.

4,Empowering polo princess: Afaf Khattak’s fearless ride,"The teenager gallops past cultural barriers, showcasing her talent in Pindi’s polo arena","In a land where cultural barriers often deter young girls from physically demanding sports, 15-year-old Afaf Khattak rides a horse fearlessly in the polo field. Despite all the challenges from cultural and societal norms to a lack of resources and funding, she is determined to make her name in the field.
According to Britannia, polo is a game of Central Asian origin first played in Iran. It dates back to the 6th century BCE and at first, it was a training game for cavalry units, usually the king’s guard or other elite troops.
Speaking from the historic Rawalpindi Polo Ground, she expresses her devotion to the game, emphasising its symbiotic bond between horse and rider. As she gears up for the Chief of Army Staff Polo Cup next month, Afaf urges the government to foster a culture of encouragement for young girls aspiring to follow her path. Under the tutelage of her father, Colonel Masoodur Rehman Khattak, she has the spirit of resilience and determination.
Beyond its rich history, polo in Pakistan resonates with legends of emperors and warriors. From the Mughal courts to the heights of Shandur, Gilgit Baltistan, where the sport reaches its peak, polo has a tradition of organising competitions.
Mughal emperor Qutbuddin Aibak died in 1210 after falling from his horse while playing polo. A similar game was played in Afghanistan for a long time. Gradually, it became a popular sport in Asia. An interesting fact about the Mughal ruler Aurangzaib Alamgir is that he used to select his military commanders from polo fields and it was these commanders with whom he ruled the subcontinent for a long time.
Apparently, this game is called running away with the ball on a horse, but actually, it is to understand the moves of the opponent and decide the strategy to defeat them. Two teams on the field try to score goals against each other. Each team consists of four horsemen. The position of these players is in order of numbers. Rawalpindi Polo Ground is historically the oldest polo ground in the world.
The biggest polo matches are organised in Shandur, Gilgit Baltistan which is known worldwide because of polo. The highest polo field in the world, it is situated at an altitude of 12,500 feet above sea level. Athletes from all over the world take part in the competitions.
Initially, a wooden ball was used for polo while now the ball is made up of plastic and it is covered with leather. The length of the stick that a player uses to hit the ball varies depending on the height of the horse. As safety measures, players involved in the sport use a helmet and face guard, horse saddles and pads for the players’ knees. There are two umpires and a referee to enforce the rules and regulations in the game of polo. For polo, expensive and rare horses are imported from different countries.
