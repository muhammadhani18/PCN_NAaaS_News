• KP govt to purchase grain ‘from local growers’
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered an increase in the wheat procurement target from 1.4 million tonnes to 1.8 million tonnes after protests by farmers over delays in the grain’s buying process.
PM Shehbaz has also dir­­ected the Pakistan Agri­­c­u­ltural Storage and Services Corporation Limited (Passco) — the national grain procurement and storage agency — to ensure swift buying to help growers.
According to a statem­ent issued by the Prime Minis­ter’s Office (PMO), Mr Sharif gave the direct­ives on Saturday before lea­ving for Saudi Arabia to participate in the World Eco­nomic Forum’s meeting.
 






The official press rele­ase called the decision “a big relief” for farmers, adding that it was taken following complaints from wheat growers.
“The prime minister has taken the initiative keeping in view the problems confronting the growers regarding the sale of wheat,” it said.
Besides increasing the wheat procurement target, the prime minister also directed Passco to ensure transparency and facilitate the growers on a priority basis.
The delay
A bumper crop output has been projected for this season and wheat threshing has already begun in most parts of Punjab, the largest wheat producing province in the county.
 
 

However, farmers complained that Passco was not purchasing wheat and flour mills were “exploiting them” by offering rates lower than the government-mandated support price for their crops.
The Sindh and Baloch­istan governments have set the support price at Rs4,000 per 40kg, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab governments Rs3,900 per 40kg.
The farmers lament that their production costs have more than doubled in the last one year but they were being forced to sell their produce at the last year’s rates and even lower than that.
The issue also resulted in heated discussions in the National and Punjab Assembly this week.
The National Assembly was told that official procurement has slowed as the caretaker government imported wheat despite having a bumper crop.
National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer admitted the decision was “wrong”, and the prime minister has already ordered an inquiry into it.
He added that the ministry would write letters to provincial governments to procure maximum wheat from the farmers.
Opposition member Sheikh Waqas Akram warned the government that farmers would be on the streets soon and “the rulers would not be able to face the brunt”.
In the Punjab Assembly, Food Minister Bilal Yasin reasoned that the moisture level in wheat was quite high, up to 18 per cent, because of which his department could not buy the produce as after drying, its weight would reduce, causing a loss to the government.
Punjab Assembly Spe­a­ker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan also conceded that even though the minimum support price was Rs3,900 per 40kg, the crop was being sold at Rs3,200 in the open market because growers were not sure whether the food department would buy their produce.
Farmers’ protests
The growers have staged protests in several areas and demanded the government increase the support price.
While addressing a press conference earlier this month, the Kisan Board Pakistan president, Sardar Zafar Hussain, urged the government to procure at least five million tonnes of wheat in the current season and raise the support to Rs5,000 per 40kg.
He alleged that the government was “deliberately delaying” the procurement campaign because of which the prices in the open market were declining.
KP govt to buy ‘local’ wheat
In a related development, the provincial food minister, Zahir Shah Toru, announced that the KP government would buy 600,000 tonnes of wheat at the rate of Rs3,900 per 40 kg.
Mr Toru made the announcement on Satur­day during a visit to a wheat godown in Nowsh­era district. The minister was briefed on the wheat procurement process and the measures taken for its safe storage in warehouses.
 
 

He said the provincial cabinet has decided to purchase wheat from local farmers at the same rate as the Punjab government.
The decision will not only result in the procurement of quality wheat but yield significant financial benefits to the province’s growers, he said.
Regarding the welfare of KP’s farmers, Mr Toru assured that their interests would be “safeguarded at all costs”.
The minister emphasised his government’s commitment toward transparency, highlighting ongoing efforts to digitise the food department’s administrative affairs to ensure accountability.
He said a five-member committee, comprising officials from the agriculture department, administration and NAB, has been constituted to oversee procurement, transportation and quality control process and prevent malpractice.

• Justice Mansoor asserts courts ‘united’ against interference
• Pro-Palestine protesters disrupt German envoy’s speech over Gaza policy
LAHORE: Senior puisne judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah on Satur­day maintained that judiciary will stand united against any interference in its system as he called for a ‘firewall’ to protect the institution from undue interference.
Speaking as chief guest at the inaugural session of the 5th Asma Jahangir Conference, Justice Shah said there was a need to develop a ‘firewall’ around the judiciary to protect it from interference.
“The judiciary will stand united against any interference that comes to our system and we take it seriously,” he said.
“All institutions in the country must realise that if there is no justice, they cannot survive,” he said and added that an independent justice system was critical for all.
“…there is no rocket science about it. Please, the justice system has to be strong, robust and independent for all institutions to develop, grow, and prosper. This is a simple message…” he said, without naming anyone.
At the outset, he paid tribute to Asma Jahangir, saying she was a formidable lawyer of Pakistan and an activist renowned for her unwavering commitment to human rights and courage in the face of opposition.
‘Dark patches of history’
Justice Shah, who will be the next chief justice, said he did not come to the conference to defend the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court or take pride in some of the good things that had been done. “I think there have been dark patches in the history of the judiciary and I am not proud of that.”
Sharing his ideas to make the judiciary as imagined by the Constitution, he said the individualistic thoughts to run the institution needed to be forgotten. He said every institution needed to be run through a system not by individuals.
Justice Shah stated that until “we transition from reliance on individuals to the system itself, this system would always be subject to the whims of individuals”.
“That’s why there’s no continuity in judicial institutions,” he said and regretted that every chief justice “takes the institution the way he likes”.
He said it was the first time when Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa surrendered his powers and implemented the practice and procedure law in the Supreme Court to establish a system. He said it was a misconception that judicial system was completely stagnant.
He pointed out that 4,000 judges worked daily and courts decided nearly 1.6 million cases in 2023. However, he said it was true that the judicial system was slow. Currently, 2.4m cases are pending in courts, he said, adding that 80 to 90 per cent of these cases were pending in the district judiciary.
He mentioned that Pakis­tan, a country of 231 million people, had the lowest number of lawyers per capita in the world. He said there was one lawyer for 1,000 citizens in Pakistan; whereas, in the United Kingdom and Austra­lia, there was one lawyer for 203 and 300 citizens, respectively.
The judge said he accepted the critique that according to a World Bank justice project, the judiciary ranked very low. “But we need to identify the steps we can take to improve our judiciary,” he added.
Judges’ appointment
He said the judiciary’s impo­r­tant aspect was the method and criteria for the appointments of judges. “The appointments of judges in district courts and high courts are a challenge for us,” he admitted.
He said the present leadership of the Supreme Court was reviewing the entire process of judges’ appointments, as it was needed to consider “not only a judge’s work and character but also end nepotism”.
He said accountability of district judges was essential, just like the Supreme Judicial Council, which hears complaints against the judges of superior courts. The SC judge said an incompetent judicial officer could not be allowed to stay in the institution till their retirement.
Justice Shah said there was a need to move with the world which “has adopted multiple alternative methods to provide justice”.
“There are other options available to resolve matters before resorting to traditional judicial proceedings,” he said. In Pakistan, he said, alternate methods of justice, particularly Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR), were being worked on.
Justice Shah said Pakistan also failed to establish designated “commercial courts”, which were given preference in the world over any other co­­u­­rt. A commercial court “boo­sts the economy and looks after the business” in a country, he said, adding that it was more important than a criminal court.
Gender representation
The senior judge also stressed the representation of women in the justice system, saying, “Our gender representation is very poor.” He said women were 50 per cent of the country’s population but this proportion did not reflect in the justice system. He pointed out that there were 562 women judges in the country, including two in the Supreme Court. “We have to take a special step to bring women judges at district, the high court and Supreme Court level,” he emphasised.
Pro-Palestine protest
During the conference, some pro-Palestine protesters interrupted the German ambassador’s speech. Moments after the envoy began his spee­­ch, a young protester shouted: “Excuse me, Mr ambassador. I am shocked by the audacity that you are here to talk about civil rights while your country is brutally abusing the people speaking for the rights of the Palestinians.”
His comments drew applause and cheer among the participants while chants of “Free, Free Palestine” and “From the River to the Sea” could also be heard.
The protest was also joined by some other students (the Progressive Students’ Collective), chanting slogans in favour of Palestinian people. Responding to protesters, Alfred Grannas said: “If you want to shout, go out, there you can shout. Because shouting is not a discussion.”
A live stream of the event muted Amb Grannas’ comments after that and then disabled the live stream for a few minutes. The PSC said the protesters were manhandled, a claim dismissed by the organisers.

2,"PTI ready to hold talks with ‘real’ stakeholders, says Senator Shibli Faraz","PTI’s ""real intentions"" exposed, says PML-N.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The PTI on Saturday reiterated its readiness to hold talks with the “real” stakeholders, provided a “suitable atmosphere” is ensured where the party’s public mandate is respected and cases against its workers and leaders are withdrawn.
The statement was made during an informal meeting atte­nded by Leader of the Oppo­sition in the Senate Shibli Faraz and reporters of electronic media at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, Islamabad.
When asked if the PTI was willing to hold negotiations with political parties, Mr Faraz said as a political party, PTI is always ready to hold talks. “However, there should be an atmosphere conducive to negotiations, which must be conducted within the parameters of the Constitution. The current atmosphere is not suitable for negotiations,” an insider quoted the PTI leader as saying.
He also said that negotiations will be held with those who have the real power. However, he did not mention whether the talks will be held with the establishment or political parties.

PTI’s ‘real intentions’ exposed: PML-N

Similar statements have been issued by PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and information secretary Raoof Hasan.
 
 

“It is the stance of the PTI that it is ready for the negotiations if its mandate, as the largest political party, is accepted and illegal cases are withdrawn,” said a PTI office-bearer.
When asked if the PTI was willing to speak to political parties, he said the PTI had in the past held negotiations with political parties for the date of elections, but nothing was decided. “So negotiations can be held with political parties again, but they might not reach any conclusion as political parties don’t have any status in the current situation,” he said.
However, a few days back, PTI leader Shehryar Afridi had said that negotiations can only be held with the establishment.
PML-N response
The PTI statement drew criticism from the PML-N on Saturday, with its leader Khawaja Saad Rafique stating that the “cat has come out of the bag”.
He criticised the PTI’s dual stance of wanting to engage in dialogue with the military while also confronting it.
Mr Rafique emphasised that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should cooperate with the Centre by remaining within constitutional limits. He warned that if PTI leader and KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur continued his aggressive stance, it would be challenging to maintain governance and engage in conflict simultaneously.
The PML-N leader also stressed the importance of dialogue between political parties, stating, “There is no concept of vandalism in democratic politics.” He linked the lack of communication with politicians to the vandalism events that occurred on May 9 last year.
PML-N’s senior leader Khurrum Dastgir said that as long as PTI continues to believe that only its votes are legitimate and others are not, it cannot sit with other political forces. “PTI needs to engage in dialogue with politicians to strengthen democracy,” he added.
 
 

The other day, PML-N parliamentary leader Senator Irfan Siddiqui, speaking in the upper house, had urged the PTI to hold talks to solve the crises facing the country. He noted that politicians faced ups and downs and governments came and went but they have to leave some traditions and legacy for future generations.
Talking about reconciliation, he had said it was a two-way process. “We are ready to extend an olive branch to PTI and let us shake hands,” he said and urged the party of ex-prime minister Imran Khan to “come forward for Pakistan and let us sit together”.
Referring to KP Chief Minister Gandapur’s reported warning that he would “attack” Islamabad in protest, Mr Siddiqui had urged PTI to do away with such tone. If PTI can shake hands with its worst political enemies such as Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, then why it cannot sit with the incumbent government in the interest of the country, he had asked.
However, PTI’s parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar had stressed that there was dire need of working together while keeping aside political differences or else matters of grave concern would be forgotten and ignored. He said parliament had lost its integrity and become a laughing stock for foreign countries because it was discharging its functions in total negation of the rules of business.

3,South Waziristan sessions judge abducted by gunmen in Dera Ismail Khan,"PHC CJ, other judges direct IGP, other officers to take steps to ensure Shakirullah Marwat’s immediate recovery.","DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Shakirullah Marwat, the sessions judge of South Waziristan district, was kidnapped by unidentified gunmen from the Garah Mohabaat Adda area of Dera Ismail Khan district on Saturday, police said.
Officials told Dawn the judge was intercepted by around 10 to 15 armed mot­orcyclists while travelling on the D.I. Khan-Tank Road towards Dera Ismail Khan. While the gunmen left the judge’s driver un­harmed, they set fire to the judge’s official vehicle before fleeing with Mr Marwat.
Garah Mohabaat, loca­t­ed at the border of Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts, falls in the jurisdiction of the Hathla police station of the restive Kula­chi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan.
While Mr Marwat is posted to the South Waziristan district, the sessions court functions from Tank due to security concerns.
The police reached the spot after the incident and launched a search for the kidnappers.
Asmat Ullah Gandapur, SHO of the Manji Khel police station, told Dawn that Tank and Dera police reached the scene and cordoned off the area to ensure the safe recovery of the judge.
Mr Gandapur said the road where the abduction occurred passes from Bhagwal Adda to Loni, a dangerous area through Graha Mohabbat.
Residents told Dawn that officers’ movements on the Tank-Dera Road continue constantly because the officers posted in Tank and South Waziristan spend the night in Dera instead of Tank.
Police officials said Dera Ismail Khan police officials previously manned the spot, but they left after an attack.
After the judge’s kidnapping, Chief Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim convened an emergency meeting at the Peshawar High Court.
Official sources said the meeting was attended by the two most senior judges of the PHC, Justices Ijaz Anwar and Syed Mohammad Attique Shah, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Mohammad Abid Majeed, Additional Chief Secretary (P&D) Imtiaz Shah, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IGP Akhter Hayat Khan.
The chief justice and other judges directed the IGP and other officers to take steps to ensure Mr Marwat’s immediate recovery.
They said the provincial government was responsible for providing security to the judges. The officers were asked to share any developments with the PHC’s registrar.
Mr Majeed and IGP Khan informed the meeting about the steps they had taken so far. They said they were in contact with the regional police officer of Dera Ismail Khan, commissioner D.I. Khan, district police officers in the region, and other security agencies.
According to officials, Mr Majeed told the meeting that he had been monitoring the entire situation and would share any development with the court as soon as he received further information.
The Dera Ismail Khan district, the hometown of KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, has witnessed an uptick in attacks on police and other law enforcement agencies over the past few months.
 
 

Last week, 12 law enforcement personnel, including eight Pakistan Customs officials, were slain in two separate attacks in the district, while two members each of police and FC also lost their lives to the militant attacks.
Similarly, in February, a militant attack on the Daraban police station resulted in the death of more than 10 police officials and injuries to several others.
In December, 23 army personnel lost their lives and 30 others were injured in a suicide attack on a compound located next to the Daraban police station.

4,Punjab continues to drag feet on local govt polls,ECP urges govt to remove requirement of electronic voting machines.,"ISLAMABAD: As Punjab keeps on delaying the local government (LG) elections, an apparently helpless Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has once again taken up the matter with the provincial government.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
In April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on Dec 31, 2021.
That means elections were supposed to take place some two years ago, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time. The change of governments in the province made no difference and it is still unclear if the holding of local bodies elections would become a reality in near future.

ECP urges govt to remove EVM requirement

A major obstacle in the way was an amendment made to the law back in 2022. Under Section 47(1) of the Punjab Local Government Act 2022, which remains intact to date, local government elections are to be held on electronic voting machines (EVMs), and voters will also have the facility of i-voting. However, Rule 35(4) of Local Government Election Rules has already been amended to allow voting as per the Elections Act 2017.
 
 

In July 2023, while refusing to use EVMs in the local government elections in Punjab, the ECP had asked the province to amend its laws and do away with provisions related to EVMs and i-voting.
The ECP in its latest communication has reminded the Punjab government of its commitment for making suitable amendment after the Feb 8 general elections.
“I am directed to refer to your letter No.PS/CS/26/2023 dated 05.10.2023 intimating therein that suitable amendment in Section-47(1) of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2022 regarding usage of EVM and i-voting and other amendments required in the Local Government Act will be placed before the elected government after general elections and till then, matter may be kept pending.
“The matter was kept pending in the light of letter referred above. Since the general elections across the country have been concluded and the assembly and elected representatives are in place, therefore, suitable amend­ment(s) in the relevant provisions of law in the Punjab Local Government Act, 2022 and Rules framed thereunder may be made at the earliest to proceed further in the matter.
“In this regard, it is to inform that Election Commission will convene a meeting with regard to the conduct of local government elections in the Punjab within a month to discuss and finalise the arrangements for the said elections,” read the letter sent by the ECP to the chief secretary and secretary, Local Government Punjab, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
