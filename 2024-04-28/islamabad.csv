0,Proposed cattle market in I-12 sector draws flak,"Plot owners say market will damage infrastructure, delay possession","ISLAMABAD: A decision by the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) to set up a cattle market in Sector I-12 – a residential sector – has caused a stir among the plot owners, who are apprehensive about this proposal which could throw a spanner in the already-sluggish development work.
It is worth mentioning that the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad announced an open auction for six cattle markets across the city, including the proposed site in Sector I-12. The newspaper advertisement sparked apprehension among the allottees waiting for possession of their plots for a long time. The development work underway for over two years includes the construction of streets and a sewage system.
People who have bought plots in this sector are already frustrated with the CDA, particularly the slow pace of development work in this sector. Tahir Mahmood, who purchased a plot in this sector almost a decade ago, is also worried about the “harmful impacts” of the proposed market. He said the establishment of a market could cause “infrastructure damage” which would need “expensive repairs” afterwards.
“With tractors, bulldozers, and other heavy machinery involved in land balancing, roads construction, and installation of sewage system, we worry that the establishment of a cattle market will disrupt these efforts, leading to further delays in possession of our plots,” he said, speaking on the behalf on allottees. “I bought a residential plot in the sector to build a home for my family. However, my dream remains unfulfilled due to the slow-paced development work in this sector,” he added.

Plot owners say market will damage infrastructure, delay possession

Fahad Hameed echoed similar concerns. He said there was a “critical need” for uninterrupted development in this sector to avoid further delays in the possession.
“We have already faced significant setbacks due to a protracted development process,” he said, adding that allottees still “hold onto the hope that the work will eventually be completed, allowing us to realise our dream of building homes for our families”.
Khumar Gul also expressed regarding the proposed cattle market. He said the potential damage to the “finished development work” could compromise the existing infrastructure. He warned if their grievances remained unaddressed they would stage a demonstration to voice their opposition.
Additional Commissioner Rana Waqas Anwar, who is also the MCI administrator, claimed that the development work would not be affected because of the proposed market. He said that it would be ensured that the cattle market would be established in open areas, such as grounds. He said the CDA sanitation team would clean the sector after Eid. MCI Administrator Rana Waqas Anwar told Dawn that the proposed cattle market was a move to facilitate the residents ahead of Eid.
“In the past, people used to establish small markets in all the sectors so it has been decided to establish six cattle markets and it will be ensured that no animal would be sold out of markets. We have finalised the arrangements for the sanitation team to clean the sector [after Eid],” he said.
Replying to a question, Rana Waqas said that the cattle market would be established in open places, such as grounds so that there would be no damage to the property or the ongoing development work.

In a letter sent to the prime minister, Mr Khan said the job quota allocated by the Establishment Division for the youth of GB was not being implemented.
“I would like to draw your kind attention towards a matter of great importance for the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, particularly the youth, who are seeking employment opportunities.”
The letter said job opportunities in government institutions are highly sought after. 
However, it came to our attention that the job quota allocated by the Establishment Division for the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is not being observed while advertising posts in various institutions of Islamabad capital territory.
This results in the lack of representation which causes a significant barrier to the inclusion and integration of GB’s youth into the mainstream national institutions. 
The letter said the residents of GB had consistently proven their commitment and loyalty to Pakistan and they should be given an equal opportunity as per the notified share.
The chief minister sought attention of the prime minister and said: “Your attention to this matter would go a long way in fostering a sense of inclusion and equality, and I believe that you have the vision and the compassion to make this possible.
“I trust that you will give this request a serious consideration and take appropriate action so that the youth of Gilgit-Baltistan are granted fair chance to compete in the upcoming positions in the ICT social security institution, labour department and other positions.”

The CLEAN is an environmental analysis facility in Pakistan equipped with state-of-the-art analytical equipment, specialising in air, water, and soil analysis.
Pak-EPA said that CLEAN Laboratory had been providing accurate and reliable environmental data to support regulatory compliance, research projects, and environmental management efforts.
The addition of advanced Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) technology was a powerful tool used to detect and measure small amounts of elements and metals in various types of samples. It helped to explore different environmental materials with great accuracy and speed.

Says ICP-OES technology a powerful tool used to detect small amounts of elements and metals in various types of samples

“Today marks a momentous occasion for Pak-EPA,” stated Pak-EPA Director General Farzana Altaf Shah, alongside Lab/National Environment Quality Standards (NEQS) Director Dr Zaigham Abbas.
The acquisition of the ICP-OES instrument would revolutionise Pak-EPA’s environmental analysis capabilities, enabling the watchdog to delve deeper into environmental samples and provide important information about pollution levels and environmental health.
Pak-EPA said that ICP-OES was a versatile analytical technique for environmental analysis, detecting heavy metal contamination in soil, water, and air samples at levels as low as parts per billion (ppb).
It also analysed nutrient levels in agricultural and ecological samples and assessed the metal content of industrial effluents. With its multi-element capability, low detection limits, and wide dynamic range, ICP-OES offers efficient and sensitive analysis, making it indispensable for environmental research and management.
In its inaugural operation, the ICP-OES instrument at CLEAN Laboratory analysed a batch of 140 samples of wastewater from the textile industry, further underscoring its efficacy in real-world environmental monitoring applications.
“Leveraging this technology, we are excited to announce that our new ICP-OES machine has successfully analysed samples of wastewater from textile industries,” Ms Shah said.
As Pakistan’s top environmental analysis facility, CLEAN Lab has been providing innovative solutions and scientific expertise to tackle environmental challenges.
With the new ICP-OES technology, the Directorate of Lab/NEQS continued to make progress in environmental research and analysis, setting new standards for excellence in environmental monitoring.

16,DHQ hospital storekeeper held over Rs90m drugs ‘scam’,SARGODHA: The Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has arrested the storekeeper of Bhakkar DHQ hospital and ...,"SARGODHA: The Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has arrested the storekeeper of Bhakkar DHQ hospital and registered a case against him, the driver and their private partner for allegedly misappropriating government medicines worth Rs90 million.  
An investigation is under way to determine the role of others involved in ‘disappearance’ of drugs from the main store of DHQ hospital.  
A three-member committee investigated the case and revealed that storekeeper Irfan Abbas along with his brother driver Imran Abbas and private person Ali Hassan have embezzled government medicines worth Rs90m.  
On the disclosure in the report of the inquiry committee of the health CEO, the ACE has registered a case under section 409/477A of Pakistan Penal Code and 5/2/47PCA against the three suspects. Irfan Abbas has been arrested while his brother Imran managed his escape from the spot.  
Locals, including the owner of a nearby medical store adjacent to DHQ hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it seemed quite impossible for a storekeeper to embezzle huge quantities of medicines without the blessings of the hospital superintendent and other high-ups of the health department.
REMOVED: The commissioner has removed a price control magistrate over poor performance and instructed nine other magistrates, including four assistant commissioners, to improve their work. 
He was addressing a review meeting of price control magistrates in his conference room on Saturday.  
In addition to acting DC Mohsin Salahuddin, ADCG, deputy director food, officials of the market committee and other relevant officers, including deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners of Khushab, Mianwali, and Bhakkar, participated via video link.  
The commissioner directed to fill vacant positions of price magistrates. He also directed DCs to lower prices of ghee in collaboration with relevant officers and dealers.  
He issued instructions to monitor demand and prices of lentils across the division.  
He emphasised the need to further reduce the price of bread after consulting stakeholders to provide relief to the public.  
He said it was commendable that under the vision of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the prescribed price for roti and naan was being implemented across the division, but strict action should also be taken against those selling underweight bread.
