3,50k lifeline consumers to get solar systems,CM vows to free the poor of expensive electricity,"Approving the distribution of solar power systems among 50,000 households in Punjab, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has directed the authorities concerned to immediately launch the pilot project to evaluate its efficiency.
Presiding over a meeting to have a detailed briefing on technical issues regarding the 1kW solar systems for the domestic consumers, she said the Roshan Punjab Programme was aimed to free the poor of expensive electricity.
Protected consumers consuming up to 100 units of electricity per month will be eligible under the programme in the first phase. Two solar panels, a battery, inverter and wires will be provided to the consumers.
The chief minister was informed that the 1kW solar system can run fans, lights and small motors. Up to 16 hours of charging backup can be provided through the lithium ion battery.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the officials concerned to install the solar systems using the latest technology. She emphasised the need to use the best quality solar plates, inverters, batteries and accessories.
“The scope of solar systems for domestic consumers will be extended gradually,” she added.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in her message on the Earth Day that using electric buses, eco-friendly fuel, modern technology and machinery will solve environmental problems.
She said the use of plastic bags will be banned across Punjab from June 5.
The chief minister appealed to all people, including shopkeepers, shopping malls, restaurants and tandoors to support the campaign of not using plastic bags, to improve human health and to contribute to the elimination of smog. “Do not use plastic bags and other plastic items, especially food and drinking utensils in homes,” she advised the citizens.

4,Pandemonium in PA over rigging allegation,"Friction between treasury, opposition escalates over alleged ‘misconduct’","In a heated session of the Punjab Assembly, both treasury and opposition lawmakers clashed over the validity of recent by-elections, each claiming to have the support of the public.
The session saw heated debates and accusations flying from both sides, with the opposition levelling allegations of unfairness and rigging in the electoral process.
Opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar launched a scathing attack on the provincial government, accusing them of using coercive tactics, including the Punjab police, to influence the election outcome.
Bhachar criticised Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the Inspector General of Police Punjab and other forces for allegedly interfering with the polling process, leading to what he described as the darkest chapter in Pakistan's electoral history.
In response, Provincial Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman rejected claims of rigging, asserting that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secured victory in the by-elections fair and square.
He argued that voters had chosen PML-N over other parties, such as the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), and questioned what actions the government could take if supporters of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) did not show up at polling stations.
Opposition leaders pressed the government on its track record, demanding to know what tangible benefits the PML-N had delivered to the people, prompting further criticism of the ruling party's governance.
Rana Aftab Khan, another prominent opposition figure, joined in condemning what he termed as rigged elections, while PTI representative Farhat Abbas accused the treasury of dismissing legitimate concerns.
The standoff underscores the deep divisions and political turmoil within the Punjab Assembly, raising questions about the transparency and fairness of the electoral process.
As tensions escalated, the opposition highlighted the lack of a quorum once again, prompting the deputy speaker to order a headcount.
With the treasury failing to muster the required number of legislators to continue proceedings, the session was adjourned until Tuesday at 11am.
