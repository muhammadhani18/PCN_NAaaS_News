STUTTGART: Kazakh fourth seed Elena Ryba­kina defeated Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk in straight sets to win the WTA event in Stuttgart on Sunday.
2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina beat Kostyuk 6-2, 6-2 in one hour nine minutes, ending the 21-year-old Ukrai­nian’s giant-killing run at the tournament.
The world number four broke Kostyuk twice in the first set and twice in the second, fighting off three break points from the world number 27 to lift her eighth career title.
Rybakina how holds a 2-1 record against Kost­yuk.
“I want to congratulate Marta for a great tournament. You’re playing really well and hopefully we play many more finals,” Rybakina said.
The title is her third of 2024, having already won in Brisbane and Abu Dhabi and it is the first time she has won three WTA titles in one year.
Sunday’s victory was also the 24-year-old’s third title win on clay in her career.
Rybakina needed to overcome world number one Iga Swiatek in Satur­day’s semi-final.
Rybakina took three hours to overcome the four-time grand slam winner and shattering her 10-match winning streak at the tournament, which included capturing the last two titles.

1,PSG close in on title with victory over Lyon,Lyon will have a chance for revenge when the two sides face each other in the French Cup final on May 25.,"PARIS: Paris St Germain continued their march towards the Ligue 1 title with a 4-1 win at home against Olympique Lyonnais on Sunday with all the goals coming in an explosive first half.
Runaway leaders PSG moved to 66 points, 11 ahead of second-placed AS Monaco with five matches left, while Lyon are eighth with 41 points.
PSG struck twice within six minutes with Lyon’s Nemanja Matic deflecting a cross into his own net after three minutes, before Lucas Beraldo doubled the hosts’ lead.
Goncalo Ramos headed in the third goal for PSG after 32 minutes before Ernest Nuamah pulled one back for Lyon five minutes later with a well-placed shot into the corner from just outside the box.
Ramos scored his second three minutes before the break when he ran into the box unmarked to slide in a low cross.
Both sides produced chances in the second half, but neither managed to add more goals.
Lyon will have a chance for revenge when the two sides face each other in the French Cup final on May 25.
Monaco moved up into second place by winning 2-0 earlier away at Brest in a battle of two teams chasing Champions League qualification.
Swiss midfielder Denis Zakaria and Japan’s Takumi Minamino got their goals, either side of half-time.
Monaco held on for the victory despite having both Eliesse Ben Seghir and Wilfried Singo sent off in stoppage time.
A third straight win for the principality side leaves them primed to go on and secure automatic qualification for next season’s Champions League, a competition they have not graced since 2018/19.
They are two points above Brest and three ahead of fourth-placed Lille, who beat Strasbourg 1-0.
Canada’s Jonathan David scored the only goal of the game to take his tally in Ligue 1 this season to 17.
The team finishing fourth will enter next season’s Champions League in the preliminary rounds.
Olympique Marseille needed a stoppage-time goal by Cameroonian striker Faris Moumbagna to grab a point in a 2-2 draw at Toulouse and sit ninth in the table.
Jordan’s Mousa Al-Tamari netted a late winner as Montpellier won 2-1 at Reims, while Metz moved out of the relegation zone by winning 1-0 at Le Havre.
The Normandy team dropped into the bottom three in their place.

2,Bellingham brings  Real to brink of title  with Clasico winner,MADRID: Jude Bellingham snatched Real Madrid a dramatic 3-2 Clasico win over champions Barcelona on Sunday with a...,"MADRID: Jude Bellingham snatched Real Madrid a dramatic 3-2 Clasico win over champions Barcelona on Sunday with a “fundamental” goal to take them 11 points clear at the top of La Liga with six games left. 
Real coach Carlo Ancelotti hailed the England midfielder’s decisive intervention to take Los Blancos to the brink of the Spanish title. 
Real twice fought back from a goal down with Vinicius Junior and Lucas Vazquez netting to level Andreas Christensen and Fermin Lopez strikes before Bellingham smashed in the winner at the far post from about six yards out to beat the champions for a fourth successive time. 
“He arrived at just the right time, he worked so hard in the game, it’s been a while since he scored and today he scored a goal that could be fundamental in winning the league,” said Ancelotti. 
Barca were left licking their wounds after being knocked out of the Champions League on Tuesday in a heartbreaking 4-1 defeat against Paris St Germain. 
Real’s win, on the other hand, ended a perfect week for Ancelotti’s side after they advanced to the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday after beating holders Manchester City on penalties. 
“What a great night for being a Real Madrid fan, it’s incredible,” Luka Modric told Real Madrid TV. “It’s a win that edges us closer to the title, it’s what we want. It was a great game, we never stopped believing. We were behind twice but kept fighting, playing well, pressing and in the end we came back time and time again.”   
Real’s penalty-saving hero against City, goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, made an early mistake to hand Barcelona the lead. 
The Ukrainian strayed from his line to try and deal with a corner but got nowhere near the ball and Christensen nodded into the empty net. 
But Real piled on the pressure and Vinicius equalised 12 minutes later from the penalty spot after Lucas Vazquez was fouled inside the box after dribbling past two defenders. 
Barcelona were not deterred and made inroads down their right flank with Lamine Yamal giving Eduardo Camavinga a torrid time. 
The 16-year-old starlet thought he had struck with a clever flick from a corner but Lunin pushed the ball to safety, with Barcelona arguing it had already crossed the line. 
La Liga does not contract goal-line technology and using VAR the officials could not confirm the ball had completely entered the goal, so the Catalans were left frustrated, 
“We deserved much more given the way we played but there’s not much we can do,” said Barca manager Xavi Hernandez, who announced in February that he was stepping down at the end of a difficult season. “[Not having goal-line technology] is a disgrace.” 
Barca were dealt a blow on the stroke of half-time when midfielder Frenkie de Jong was taken off on a stretcher after hurting his ankle in a challenge by Fede Valverde. 
Xavi also brought Lopez on for Christensen at the interval and it paid dividends for the coach after a slower start to the second half. 
The midfielder was in the right place at the right time to finish after 69 minutes when Lunin could only parry Yamal’s low effort back into danger. 
However Real, seeking a fifth league and Champions League double, swiftly struck back when Vinicius crossed to the back post and Vazquez arrived to finish. 
Marc-Andre Ter Stegen made a brilliant save to thwart Vinicius with Real looking for a winner to virtually wrap up their La Liga title. 
Bellingham dealt the killer blow, despite largely being kept quiet by the Catalans until he appeared to emphatically decide the match in stoppage time from Vazquez’s cross. 
“It’s hard to find words for it. It’s an accumulation of many things. We have not been at the level of competitiveness that we should have been. And that cost us,” Barca goalkeeper Ter Stegen told Movistar Plus+. 
Earlier Atletico Madrid suffered a 2-0 defeat at Alaves to dent their chances of a top four finish and end a woeful week, after being knocked out of the Champions League in midweek by Borussia Dortmund. 
Diego Simeone’s side, fourth, lead fifth place Athletic by three points after Carlos Benavidez and Luis Rioja’s strikes consigned them to defeat. 
“After Tuesday’s [Champions League] blow, it’s not easy to come out of it. Right away, their first chance was a goal. We couldn’t have a first half where we could play the game we wanted,” coach Simeone told DAZN. 
“The second half was different, we were closer to equalising. Rioja then scored a great goal. We congratulate them and let’s get back to work.”

Charles De Ketelaere’s header just before half-time and a beautifully taken finish from El Bilal Toure in the 72nd minute moved Atalanta to within one point of fifth-placed AS Roma.
A top-five finish in Serie A guarantees a spot in next season’s Champions League thanks to Italian clubs’ strong performances in continental event.
Earlier, Lecce took a huge leap towards safety from relegation with a thumping 3-0 win at Sassuolo.
Lecce are 13th, seven points above the bottom three after a second straight win against direct rivals for the drop which came through early goals from Valentin Gendrey and Patrick Dorgu and Roberto Piccoli’s 61st-minute strike.

4,Jinnah Stadium to host Challenge Cup knockouts,KARACHI: The Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Committee has succeeded in finding an alternative venue to...,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Committee has succeeded in finding an alternative venue to holding the knockout stages of the National Challenge Cup.
The tournament, which kicked off 15 months ago, will conclude at Islamabad’s Jinnah Stadium next month, the PFF NC announced on Monday.
The PFF NC had been forced to look for an alternative venue for the country’s premier cup tournament due to the unavailability of the Punjab Stadium, its first choice.
“Delighted to announce that the National Challenge Cup will kick off at the Jinnah Stadium, Islamabad on May 1,” it said in a post on Facebook.
The 30th edition of the Challenge Cup kicked off in January last year and only the group stages of an expanded 32-team tournament were played with the PFF NC announcing that the latter stages would be held afterwards. It finally announced earlier this month that it will hold the knockout stages from May 1 to 12.

5,Late Stanisic goal salvages Leverkusen’s unbeaten run,DORTMUND: Bayer Leverkusen’s Josip Stanisic scored a stoppage-time goal for the champions to rescue a 1-1...,"DORTMUND: Bayer Leverkusen’s Josip Stanisic scored a stoppage-time goal for the champions to rescue a 1-1 Bundesliga draw at Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, sparing Xabi Alonso’s side from suffering their first loss of the season.
Striker Niclas Fuellkrug gave Dortmund the lead in the 81st minute but Stanisic levelled for Leverkusen in the seventh minute of stoppage time, heading home a Florian Wirtz corner.
The Croatia defender helped extend the newly-crowned champions’ unbeaten run in all competitions to 45 games after they secured their first Bund­esliga title with a 5-0 victory over Werder Bremen last weekend.
Leverkusen are on 80 points from 30 games.
Dortmund, who on Tuesday advanced to the Champions League semi-finals with a 5-4 aggregate win over Atletico Madrid, are fifth with 57 points, two points behind RB Leipzig.
Alejandro Grimaldo came close to scoring for Leverkusen twice towards the end of the first half, both times sending the ball narrowly over the bar, before goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky dived to deny Dortmund’s Marcel Sabitzer from close range.
Nathan Tella could have then opened the scoring for Alonso’s men from point-blank range in the 68th minute, after Jonas Hofmann squared him the ball inside the box, but Dortmund keeper Gregor Kobel caught the ball on the goalline.
Despite a narrow advantage on the visitors’ side, Fuellkrug put Dortmund in front with a late volley inside the left post, after Sabitzer teed him up with a lovely cushioned pass before the ball went in off Hradecky’s gloves.
Things got tense between the players and Leverkusen forward Victor Boniface was initially shown a red card for what seemed an unsportsmanlike conduct but referee overturned his decision after a VAR check.
Grimaldo had another great chance from a free kick as he sent the ball towards the upper corner that was denied by a stunning save from Kobel, before Stanisic found the record-saving equaliser less than a minute later following a corner.
Meanwhile, Werder Bremen took a major step to top-flight survival as Marvin  Ducksch scored a brace in a 2-1 home win over high-flying Stuttgart.
The  victory, Bremen’s first since mid-February, lifts Ole Werner’s side to  34 points, eight clear of the relegation play-off spot and above a  clutch of teams living dangerously near the drop.
For the  third-placed visitors, who have guaranteed at least a Europa League  place for next season, the loss was their first since January.
In Sunday’s late game, Mainz drew 1-1 at Freiburg to lift themselves out of the relegation spots for the first time since August. 
Jonathan Burkardt levelled things up for the visitors after Michael Gregoritsch’s early strike, sending Mainz into the safety of 15th and pushing Bochum into the relegation play-off spot.

6,China terms swimmer doping reports ‘fake news’,World anti-doping agency WADA says there is “a lack of any credible evidence” to challenge China’s version of events.,"BEIJING: Beijing on Monday called reports about 23 Chinese swimmers testing positive for a banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021  “fake news”.
The sport was rocked at the weekend by revelations that the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ) — a prescription heart drug that is banned in athletes because it can enhance performance — before the Games three years ago.
The swimmers were allowed to compete in Tokyo after world governing bodies accepted China’s findings that they had ingested it unwittingly from food during a competition in late 2020 and early 2021.
Several went on to win medals, including gold, and many are in line to compete at the Paris Olympics this summer.
China’s foreign ministry on Monday hit back at the widespread reports, which first emerged in the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD on Saturday and cited a review of confidential documents and emails.
“The relevant reports are fake news and not factual,” said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin.
World anti-doping agency WADA has said there was  “a lack of any credible evidence” to challenge China’s version of events.
“I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response,” Wang said.
However, the United States Anti-Doping Agency called news of the failed tests  “crushing” and blasted WADA’s response as  “a devastating stab in the back of clean athletes”.
Wang said China’s anti-doping centre conducted an  “in-depth and detailed” probe into the incident, which found the athletes had ingested contaminated drugs  “without their knowledge”.
“The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation,” he told a regular press conference in Beijing.
“After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre.”
An Australian coach who works with the Chinese Swimming Association also rejected claims of systemic state-run doping, saying it is  “so far from anything I have seen”.
Denis Cotterell, who has coached drug-tainted Chinese swimmer Sun Yang, told The Sydney Morning Herald he disputed  “any suggestion of anything orchestrated”.
The 74-year-old has had an on-off association with Chinese swimming for more than a decade and said he was speaking from first-hand experience.
“I see what they [the swimmers] go through, I see the measures, I can tell you the stories. I know the facts and I am comfortable,” he told the paper.
“The suggestion that it’s systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.”
Chinese state media downplayed the accusations in domestic reports and said other countries were conspiring against Beijing’s national swim team.
Xinhua news agency published an article on Sunday referring to  “some foreign media reports” without mentioning details of the allegations, with most of the article a paraphrase of WADA’s statement.
 
 

State-owned tabloid Global Times on Monday called the allegations  “slanderous accusations”, suggesting that foreign media reports on the issue were part of Western efforts to block China’s rise as a sporting power.
“Relevant countries are currently manipulating the issue of doping and smearing China’s swimming program, clearly doing so intentionally,” the Global Times said.
Discourse on China’s tightly censored social media echoed state media sentiments, with internet users saying the allegations would not stop the Chinese swim team.
“Why are they targeting China’s swimming team? It’s because we’re getting stronger and stronger,” one Weibo user said.
ARD aired a documentary on the subject Sunday, with the Montreal-based WADA issuing a fresh statement afterwards.
“The agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” it said.
Wang said the Chinese government  “consistently upholds a resolutely zero-tolerance position when it comes to doping”, adding China upholds  “fair competition” in sport.
Chinese swimming has a chequered doping history. Seven Chinese swimmers tested positive for steroids at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima.
In 1998, swimmer Yuan Yuan was banned after Australian customs officers discovered a large stash of growth hormone in her bags at the world championships in Perth.
Three-time Olympic champion Sun is about to finish a second doping ban. His first, in 2014, was for taking TMZ.

7,"Bowlers with ‘X-factor’ will hold key in T20 World Cup, says Daren Sammy","“It’s not just the young bowlers, every single international bowler has been under pressure,"" West Indies head coach says.","NEW DELHI: With T20 cricket becoming increasingly more batter-dominated, bowlers with the ‘X-factor’ could make all the difference in the World Cup in June, West Indies head coach Daren Sammy told Reuters.
The batting bias of cricket’s shortest format is evident in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), where 200-plus scores have become a routine and 300 does not look impossible anymore.
Sammy, who captained West Indies to both their T20 World Cup titles, expected the batting carnage to continue in the June showpiece.
“Bowlers have been under the pump,” the former all-rounder said in a telephone interview from his T20 World Cup trophy tour in Saint Lucia. “It’s not just the young bowlers, every single international bowler has been under pressure.
“Look at the IPL right now. Teams are scoring 200 and it’s not a safe total. It tells you that the batsmen are really dominating T20 cricket now.”  While teams would pack their squads with power-hitters,
Sammy reckoned bowlers with unconventional skills or action could prove crucial in the June 1-29 tournament.
“The difference will be some X-factor bowlers,” the 40-year-old said. “Whether that’s pace, whether that’s mystery spin – you’d need that in your armoury in order to defend totals or restrict opponents.”
The other way to silence the blazing bats would be with raw pace, he said. “Pace is pace,” Sammy said citing the importance of Lasith Malinga in Sri Lanka’s victory in the 2014 T20 World Cup, and the roles Fidel Edwards, Jerome Taylor and Ravi Rampaul played under his captaincy.
“Whether the wicket is spin-friendly or seam-friendly, genuine pace will always create doubts in the batsman’s mind. “To have that in your armoury is always a plus,” Sammy added.
From a batting point of view, Sammy said the current West Indies team were comparable to the sides that won the World Cups under his captaincy. Their bowling, however, would depend a lot on how their all-rounders contribute.
“Obviously I’d love to have the ‘X-factor’ that I had in 2012 and 2016, when I had two bowlers ranked among the top five. We don’t have that now.
“What we do have is Akeal Hosein, who’s ranked number three. We also have (Gudakesh) Motie, who’s very effective in the middle overs,” he said of his spin attack. “We have guys like (pacer) Alzarri Joseph and the all-rounders that we had in 2016 as well, who could use the conditions to our advantage.”
West Indies captain Rovman Powell recently said they were trying to talk veteran spinner Sunil Narine, also an explosive opener, out of retirement.
Sammy, who recalled senior players including Andre Russell and Shimron Hetmyer since taking charge, was not sure about Narine’s availability. “You’ve seen experienced guys coming back into the squad. I had the same conversation with Narine,” he said. “We still continue to chat, but at the end of the day, if he is retired, he’s not available for selection.”
West Indies will co-host the tournament with the United States.

8,Pakistan to shuffle batting order further after stunning loss to New Zealand,"""We will be flexible as far as the batting positions are concerned,"" says head coach Azhar Mahmood.","RAWALPINDI: Pakistan’s batting order is far from settled with the T20 World Cup less than two months away and according to their head coach Azhar Mahmood, more shuffling is expected.
Azhar, appointed in the role solely for the ongoing five-match Twenty20 International series against New Zealand, realised this when Pakistan failed to score big enough to avoid defeat in the third T20 on Sunday against the BlackCaps, who rode on a blistering knock by Mark Chapman to level the series 1-1.
The hosts managed 178 runs after winning the toss and opting to bat first, and the total was chased with eight balls and seven wickets to spare by New Zealand, thanks to Chapman’s 87 off 42.
 
 

While the left-hander’s onslaught was boosted by a dropped catch when he was playing at 16, he still could have had a more challenging target to pursue had Pakistan scored at a better pace in the middle overs.
After skipper Babar Azam and his opening partner Saim Ayub had given Pakistan a flying start in the powerplay, the scoring rate slowed down with Mohammad Rizwan and Usman Khan at the crease before Shadab Khan and Irfan Khan somewhat pulled Pakistan out of danger.
Pakistan may go into the fourth T20, which is to be held in Lahore on Thursday, with a different batting line-up as they try to find the right combination ahead of the World Cup, scheduled for June in the United States and the West Indies.
“I have said this before as well that your top three is fixed but after that we have to look at matchups and decide accordingly,” Azhar said in the post-match press conference.
“In this match [third T20I] we wanted Rizwan to get some time in the middle since the first match was washed out due to rain.
“But going forward we will be flexible as far as the batting positions are concerned since one number is not set for a particular player,”
Azhar believed Rizwan’s strike rate and Usman’s struggles to shine in an unfamiliar batting position at number four kept Pakistan from posting a challenging total before the pitch started helping the New Zealand bowlers.
“We were 15 to 20 runs short based on the par score,” said the former all-rounder. “We started quite well in the first six overs and scored around 54 runs. Shadab played very well towards the end. But I think we lost momentum in the middle overs as the ball was gripping a bit.”
Azhar, however, gave full credit to Chapman for his absolute battering of the Pakistan bowlers.
“These are the things we have to learn to improve,” he noted. “But you have to pay credit to the way Chapman played. In T20 cricket, if one man stands up, he can take the game away from you.”

Marsh, who is expected to captain Australia in T20’s showpiece event in the West Indies and the US starting on June 1, returned home after playing just four matches for Delhi in the IPL.
“I don’t think he would be coming back [to India],” Ponting told reporters. “Cricket Australia were really keen to have Mitchell at home to start his recovery process, so we sent him back as soon as we could.”
The former Australia captain added:  “They have been managing his rehab over the last couple of weeks now. I spoke to him the other day, it seems like it has taken a little bit longer than he first thought, to get over it.
“I don’t think the World Cup will be an issue but I think it will be hard to see him coming back here at the back end of this tournament.”
The 32-year-old Marsh suffered a partial tear in his right hamstring after he scored just 61 runs and claimed one wicket from four matches.
The all-rounder has played 54 T20 internationals for Australia.
This year’s IPL ends on May 26 with the final in Chennai.

Nadal, who turns 38 in June, has said he expects this to be his final year on tour after struggling with a hip injury that sidelined him for virtually all of 2023 as well as the start of this season.
The Spaniard played doubles with Roger Federer at the 2022 Laver Cup as the Swiss star made a tearful farewell to the sport at the team competition.
Nadal will join compatriot Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev as Europe attempt to win back the Laver Cup under coach Bjorn Borg from Sept 20-22.
“I am very happy to be playing Laver Cup in Berlin for Team Europe,” Nadal said in a statement. “I have some really special memories from my Laver Cup experiences, including all the emotions from London two years ago playing alongside Roger for the last time.
“At this stage in my career I really want to go out there and make the most of every opportunity I am given.”
Nadal made a brief comeback in Brisbane in early January but missed the Australian Open and spent another three months out after he felt a hip problem resurface.
He returned to action at the Barcelona Open last week but lost in the second round of a tournament he has won 12 times.
The former world number one, whose ranking has tumbled to 512, has not won a title since claiming the last of his record 14 French Open crowns two years ago.
Team World at this year’s Laver Cup will again be coached by John McEnroe, with Australian Alex de Minaur so far joined by US duo Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul in the line-up.

Reports on Saturday said the Serbian would skip the tournament and continue his preparations for next month’s French Open at the Italian Open in Rome.
Djokovic last played at the Monte Carlo Masters earlier this month, reaching the semi-finals, where he was beaten by Casper Ruud. He has not won a title this season and has played in just four tournaments.
The 24-time Grand Slam champion has won the Madrid Open on three occasions, but has played the tournament just once since winning his last title at the Caja Magica in 2019.
Djokovic was in Madrid on Sunday to watch Real Madrid claim a 3-2 comeback win in a LaLiga clash against rivals Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu.
He is also set to attend the Laureus Awards in the Spanish capital later on Monday, in which he could be crowned Sportsman of the Year.

Pant, a wicket-keeper/batsman, took the field in the T20 tournament this season as captain of Delhi Capitals after 14 months away from top-level cricket due to the crash.
The 26-year-old left-handed batter has scored 254 runs including two half-centuries in eight matches and looked sharp behind the wickets.
“I want every young player to play but unfortunately we can only pick 15,” Ganguly, who is Delhi’s Director of Cricket, told reporters on Pant’s India selection.
“The [more] equipped, the better one’s play... I feel Pant is definitely in that bracket. And I am sure he will go to the West Indies.”
Ganguly said Pant’s ability to hit  “big sixes” makes him stand out and advised the Indian players to  “just play without fear”.
Delhi head coach Ponting said he was sure Indian selectors would choose Pant for the T20’s showpiece tournament beginning June 1 in the West Indies and the United States.
“I think his batting is getting better and better by the game,” Ponting said, calling Pant the  “heart and soul” of the franchise.
“I think he has started to get a bit more trust and belief in his body as well. His keeping skills behind the stumps have been really good,” he added.
“He is too good a player and can have too much of an impact on the game for India not to select him in the squad.”
Pant crashed his car north of New Delhi in December 2022, suffering multiple injuries when the vehicle rammed into a crash barrier, flipped over and caught fire.
He underwent an intensive rehabilitation programme after the crash left him with a damaged ligament in his right knee, a hurt wrist and ankle, and abrasions to his back.
Pant has played 129 internationals for India across three formats, scoring 4,123 runs, including six centuries.
Ganguly, one of India’s most successful captains, also said Virat Kohli  “should open” as a T20 batter in the World Cup, after some critics suggested the veteran is too slow by modern-day standards.
Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s Kohli leads the IPL batting chart with 379 runs including hitting the first century of this season off 67 balls.
Comparisons have been drawn with Sunrisers Hyderabad opener Travis Head, who got his ton in 39 balls and has guided his team to record IPL totals of 277 and 287.
“Virat Kohli has got the capability of getting a 40-ball hundred also,” Ganguly, also ex-chief of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, said.
“With the talent they have, [India] just need to go and hit. The mindset should be to hit.”
