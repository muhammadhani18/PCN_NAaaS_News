KARACHI: The Provincial Apex Committee on Monday approved strict action against the sale of stolen or snatched mobiles phones and vehicles and their spare parts in the city markets as part of the measures being taken to curb the growing incidents of street crime.

The meeting was informed that the police conducted 467 encounters in 2024. In these encounters, 67 criminals were killed, 489 injured and 1,766 were arrested. The weapons recovered from the criminals included one SMG, 2,111 pistols, 30 rifles, seven shotguns and 18 grenades.
The CM instructed the IGP to reactivate the Shaheen Force with a dedicated motorcycle squad of 386 motorcycles. “The squad should patrol the identified hotspots during peak hours, and each SSP should issue and implement a patrolling plan,” he further ordered. 
Additionally, the police department was directed to revamp Madadgar-15.
The home minister announced that additional 168 vehicles, including 120 motorbikes, would be deployed to enhance the police force’s capabilities.
Police pickets to be set up in riverine area
The committee also decided to establish police pickets to strengthen security along the left bank of the River Indus and contain the dacoits within the katcha area.
The home minister informed the meeting that as many as 107 police pickets had been constructed along the left bank since July 22, where 759 police personnel were currently deployed. The meeting noted that 118 people were kidnapped from January to April 19, 2024, of whom 96 were recovered, and 22 remained missing.
The minister also informed the meeting that there were only about 90 dacoits, and the others were their tribesmen. He added that he had spared 3,000 policemen and deployed 1,000 each in Ghotki, Kashmore and Shikarpur.
He also mentioned that he had discussed the matter with the RPO of Bahawalpur and DIG Rajanpur for the establishment of police pickets on the side of Punjab.
The CM directed the chief secretary to get the work on the Ghotki-Kandhkot bridge sped up.
The DG Rangers told the CM that he had also deployed personnel for the security of the workers engaged in the construction work of the bridge.
The CM warned that the recovery of ransom from the families of the kidnapped individuals would be considered terror financing, and the people involved in facilitating the collection of the ransom amount would be identified through intelligence work to crush them.

5,Govt’s request to seek adjournment  in decade-old case irks CJP,KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Monday expressed resentment towards government authorities for an inordinate delay in ...,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Monday expressed resentment towards government authorities for an inordinate delay in a case pending before the apex court for the past 14 years and directed the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) to engage a counsel to plead the case.
The court also issued notices to the KMC, master plan department, Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and other respondents in a petition filed in 2020 against the commercialisation of a Clifton Road.
A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, also sought suggestions from some senior lawyers about the time period to file appeals in the Supreme Court against the orders of the high courts.
About commercialisation of a thoroughfare and unauthorised construction of a high-rise building, the CJP remarked that the court was aware of unauthorised and illegal activities being carried out in the provincial metropolis.
The bench was hearing a number of cases at the Supreme Court Karachi Registry.
At the outset, the bench took up for hearing a matter filed by the then City District Government Karachi (CDGK) in 2010 against an order of the Sindh High Court about the ownership of a plot located in Clifton.
The chief justice was visibly angry when a lawyer for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) sought time to plead the case. The CJP deplored that the matter was pending for almost 15 years, but the lawyers were not ready to proceed with it.
The chief justice summoned Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and local government secretary.
Mayor Wahab appeared in court and submitted that the case was filed by the defunct CDGK and now the issues of land came within the domain of the KDA.
The director general of the KDA, Syed Shujaat Hussain, was also in attendance and he submitted that he was unaware of such matter and requested for a short adjournment.
Adjourning the case for April 26, the bench directed the KDA chief to engage a counsel and made it clear that no further adjournment would be granted in the cases of public importance.
During the hearing, the CJP also asked some senior lawyers — Dr Farogh Naseem, Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, Khalid Jawed and Faisal Siddiqi — present during the proceedings regarding the time period to file appeals in the apex court against the orders of high courts.
They said that a five-member bench of the apex court had passed an order on the subject matter, but the same had a limited scope and suggested that it can be taken up for reconsideration on the administrative side.
Commercialisation of road
The bench also issued notices to the KMC, master plan department, CBC and other respondents in a petition filed in 2020 against the commercialisation of Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman Road and subsequent construction of high-rises.
The petitioner’s lawyer submitted that high-rises were being built after the commercialisation of the road which, he claimed, could not be commercialised under the relevant laws.
Referring to the construction of a 22-storey building apparently built without proper documentation, the CJP remarked that they would not go into it at the moment, but were aware of the unauthorised and illegal activities being carried out in the city. 
A counsel for one of the respondents /builder argued that amalgamation and commercialisation fee in respect of the entire land was paid to the relevant departments.
But the lawyer for the petitioners contended that the same was not established. Thereafter, the lawyer for the builder submitted that if permitted he would file the proof of such payment.
Putting the respondents on notice, the apex court directed them to files comments/replies till April 25. 
Plea against auction of land dismissed
The bench also dismissed a review application of a private contractor filed against the auction of a piece of land in Paposh Nagar as the provincial government submitted that it was planning to set up a bus terminal on the subject land.
The chief justice remarked that the subject amenity plot belonged to the people of Karachi and the land could only be used for public services.
He also said that it was the prerogative of the government to recall the auction, but it was good if the government was utilising such land for public services.
The lawyer for the petitioner stated that the petitioner had offered the highest bid and also paid 25 per cent of total amount.
A law officer of the Sindh transport department stated that the government was planning to build a bus terminal on the subject land. 
Plea of FBR rejected
The apex court on Monday also turned down an application filed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) seeking a review of an earlier order of apex court against the award of a contract to a firm for tracking and monitoring of imported cargo.
In 2022, while dismissing an appeal of the FBR against an order of the SHC, the Supreme Court had directed the federal government to initiate an inquiry into identifying officers of the FBR responsible for awarding a contract to the NLC Construction Solutions (Pvt) Ltd for tracking and monitoring of imported cargo in real time in the Afghanistan transit trade.
The chief justice expressed resentment against the FBR chairman for filing a review application in order to protect the officers responsible for selecting an unqualified and inexperienced firm to award the contract. 
He also asked court office to send this order to the ministry of finance and FBR members.

Of the two new routes, one would connect Powerhouse Chowrangi in North Karachi with Nasir Jump in Korangi and the other would ferry female passengers from Gulshan-e-Hadeed to Tower.
The initiative, launched under the Peoples Bus Service, would take the total routes of women-only service to five as three routes are already operating. With a fleet of total of 10 new buses, the Pink Bus Service is expected to serve thousands of women on the two busy routes.
During the launching ceremony organised by Sindh transport department at Frere Hall Karachi, chief of the Pakistan Peoples Party women’s division Faryal Talpur called the service a “gift from the Sindh government to women.”
“The provision of safe and comfortable travel is a valuable gift from the Sindh government to women. By offering such facilities and empowering women, we can foster development and prosperity in our society,” she said in her address.

Two new routes of women-only bus service launched

Ms Talpur urged the transport minister to introduce “at least” more economical and cheaper fares for the women passengers, if the bus service was unable offer free rides to them.
On her appeal, Sindh Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon announced two-month free travel for all women passengers on the new routes of the Pink Bus Service. Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, his deputy Salman Abdullah Murad and Sindh minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah also attended the ceremony.
In his address, the transport minister said the fresh initiative was part of materialisation of the PPP’s manifesto which promised women empowerment.
“These new initiatives are actually the results of guidance of the leadership of the PPP particularly, Ms Talpur,” he said. “This initiative has garnered widespread appreciation globally, with international media commending the project by the Sindh government. The high-quality standards, affordable fares, and commitment to safety of the pink bus service have been praised worldwide,” he shared.
He said that the efforts were underway to train female drivers, conductors and the staff, ensuring efficient and effective service delivery and the Sindh government remained steadfast in its commitment to empower women.
In the ceremony, Ms Talpur presented licenses to 4 female drivers of the Pink Bus Service. 
Launched in February 2023, the Pink Bus Service is now offering services on five routes, with one operating between Model Colony and II Chundrigar Road passing through Star Gate, Nata Khan Bridge, Drigh Road Station, PAF Base Faisal, Laal Kothi, Karsaz, Nursery, FTC, Regent Plaza, JPMC, Cant Station, Metropole, Regal Chowk and Aram Bagh.

8,Animal lovers gather to remember elephant Noor Jehan  on first anniversary its death,Speakers highlight plight of captive wild animals in country; call for reuniting Madhubala with her sisters in Safari Park,"KARACHI: Exactly one year after the tragic and untimely demise of African elephant Noor Jehan at the Karachi Zoo, animal lovers, including wildlife conservationists, musicians, artists, filmmakers and animal welfare activists, gathered on the call of Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) and the I Am Noor Jehan Movement, at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture on Monday. 
Speaking on the occasion, documentary filmmaker and co-founder of PAWS Mahera Omar said that Noor Jehan was born free in the wild lands of Tanzania. “She was a baby still nursing from her mother when brutally captured by a Pakistani animal trader in 2009, along with three other baby elephants, after killing their mothers, to be forcibly brought to Karachi for a harsh life in captivity,” she said. 
“We are gathered here today in her loving memory, and to highlight the plight of the many other wild animals suffering in captivity in Pakistan,” she added. “Zoos rob elephants of their most basic needs. Elephants are active for 18 hours and roam up to 30 miles a day in the wild. They live in social herds and form complex lifelong bonds with each other,” she said. 
“Foot problem from cement floors is a leading cause of death for elephants in captivity. Wild animals belong in the wild. They don’t deserve a life in captivity. Several zoos abroad have shut down their elephant exhibits, including San Francisco, Chicago, Toronto and London Zoo. The last three elephants remaining in Pakistan — Madhubala, Malika and Sonu — deserve a better life in a species appropriate sanctuary. We must do all that we can to ensure they spend the rest of their lives together free from pain and suffering, and try to right the years of wrongs that have been done to them over the last 15 years in our country.” 

Speakers highlight plight of captive wild animals in country; call for reuniting Madhubala with her sisters in Safari Park

Currently, Madhubala lives in the Karachi Zoo while her sisters, Malika and Sonu, are at the Safari Park. The elephants had been broken into pairs soon after arriving in Pakistan. 
Animal activist Jude Allen thanked all who helped Noor Jehan in her final days at the Karachi Zoo including her team of doctors led by Dr Amir Khalil and other international and local doctors including Dr Shalla Hayat and Dr Zulfiqar Otho. 
“We are here to celebrate the legacy of Noor Jehan. Her spirit lives on though she has transitioned to another world after spending a life in captivity,” he said.  He also thanked PAWS and Four Paws International along with all the other organisations that work for the betterment of animals for lending their support. 
He said that after Noor Jehan died, Madhubala, the other elephant left behind in her enclosure, was grieving and lonely but the Four Paws team trained him to train Madhubala, which he has been doing since November last year. “We have now developed a bond of trust. She loves to play. We play football in which she also cheats,” he chuckled. 
But he also mentioned, on being coaxed by Mahera, something which showed how majestic and intelligent animals are. 
“They sense everything. Today, on Noor Jehan’s first death anniversary, I noticed Madhubala after training to go to the area in her cage where Noor Jehan is buried and circle it,” he shared, making everyone very sad for the late elephant and her captive friend who still misses her. 
“As an animal lover, I had the worst experience treating Noor Jehan in her final days,” said Dr Zulfiqar Otho, one of the veterinarians who were treating Noor Jehan. “There was so much mismanagement and she died young. I could see the will to live in her eyes but no energy in her body,” he said. 
Also present were Salman Ali and Azhar Khan who had helped lift Noor Jehan so that she could stand. “It was not like taking care of a sick dog or cat, who you can pick up and carry. This was lifting four to six tonnes,” Salman reminded. 
Everyone was in agreement that Madhubala should be shifted from the zoo and be reunited with her sisters at the Safari Park. The grieving Madhubala has not seen her sisters in 14 years. 
Finally, Fizza Anvarali sang a sweet song she had written in memory of Noor Jehan, wishing freedom for all birds and creatures.

10,Qawwal group mesmerises audience at Arts Council,KARACHI: The Arts Council of Pakistan held an Eid Milan event on Sunday evening for its members at which the ...,"KARACHI: The Arts Council of Pakistan held an Eid Milan event on Sunday evening for its members at which the renowned qawwal group Farid Ayaz and Abu Muhammad performed. 
It is a fact that the qawwal gharana is inarguably the most prominent in comparison to their contemporaries having an international fan-base. Justifiably so. The reason for it is that they have mastered their craft and perform with a great deal of understanding of the kalaam. Their performance on Sunday was no different. In fact, it was better than the last time they took the stage at the council.
However, Farid Ayaz has developed this habit of constantly preaching the audience. There is nothing wrong with that. He is a senior, experienced artist. The problem that sometimes arises is because of an air of condescension with which he does that. During the performance, for example, he said to his fellow musicians that ‘present something that the audience could understand’. When you are performing in front of hundreds of people, talking to them sternly for not paying attention… it doesn’t create a cordial atmosphere. That being said, the audience didn’t seem to mind it and enjoyed the qawwali.
The group began the show with Qasida Burda Sharif. It was masterfully and soulfully done. Then they shifted their attention to warming up the attendees by presenting the famous Mera Piya Ghar Aaya. As always, the group intersperse the main bit with Urdu and Punjabi verses that added a rhythmic charm to the tune. To boot, the fellow younger performers (members of their family) who flank the two main senior artists did extremely well by singing extra bits. Their control and voice projection was worth praising.
Then came Dum Hama Dum Ali Ali. It was another soul-stirring piece which got the audience to hum along. And it didn’t take the qawwals much time to move from that composition to the very well-known and loved Chhap Tilak Sab Chheen Li. This is the kind of kalaam that a lot of people know by heart which is why they invariably find themselves singing with the vocalists. The brothers also performed, among other pieces, verses of Allama Iqbal’s poetry.
All in all, it was a good concert.

12,"Ismaili council office raided, ransacked by police on ‘incorrect information’",THATTA: The Sujawal police on late Sunday evening stormed their way into the office of ‘The Shia Imami Ismaili...,"THATTA: The Sujawal police on late Sunday evening stormed their way into the office of ‘The Shia Imami Ismaili Council’ in Var town by breaking open the main gate and ransacking the CCTV camera network and smashing windows apparently to vent their anger over some unknown and unrevealed happening that may have infuriated them.  
A large number of enraged community members living in the neighbourhood strongly reacted to, what they believed, ‘uncalled for and unwarranted’ police action. They came out of their homes and held a noisy demonstration raising slogans against the local police, who failed to come out with any plausible explanation for their action. Leaders of the community approached the Ghorabari DSP and Sujawal SSP to ascertain the reason for the “highly provocative act on the part of the police team, led by Sujawal SHO Sajjad Jamali”.
Vehicular traffic between Var town and Thatta city remained suspended during the course of the protest that continued for about two hours. 
Council’s claim
A member of the council’s staff who was present in the office when the raid was conducted, claimed that members of the police team in an aggressive manner broke open the main gate, smashed windows, barged into the office and dismantled the CCTV network without informing him of a reason for the action. The raiding team also advanced towards the adjacent Ismaili community hall (Jamaat Khana) but could not enter into it seemingly fearing a violent reaction from a large number of enraged community members who had already gathered there and were resisting the police action.
In an attempt to escape the protesters’ rage, the Sujawal SHO and two of the accompanying police officers kept warning them against “interfering in the discharge of their official duty”.
After the episode, the SHO and other officers tried to calm down the community members claiming that they had received information that a ‘gutka factory’ was functioning on the premises of the office and the raid was aimed at unearthing the same. 
However, the protesters disbelieved their contention arguing that why was the building pelted with stones by members of the police party during the action.
Police on the back foot 
When the raiding team withdrew from the council building to return to the police station, the angry protesters followed them and some of them went into the office of the SHO to lodge a complaint. 
However, SHO Jamali appeared regretful and started trying to convince them that all this happened owing to the “wrong information”.
“We did not know the raiding site belonged to the Ismaili community; we never intended to hurt sentiments of the community; the wrong information we had received actually made us to conduct the raid,” the SHO was quoted as telling the protesters.
In the meantime, the Ghorabari DSP also arrived to regret over the raid. He maintained that he was absolutely unaware of the police action before it was taken. He said no advance information was sent to his office nor was such a permission sought.
Thatta SSP Imran Khan, when contacted by Dr Nazir Jummani, President of the Ismaili Council for Thatta and Shah Bundar, also denied having ordered any such raid.
Probe promised
A delegation of the Iocal Ismaili community led by Qaim Karwani approached Sujawal SSP Dr Khaliq Pirzada and narrated the whole episode to him. The SSP assured the delegation that a departmental inquiry against the police officers and personnel involved in the matter would be ordered.
According to some protesters living close to the council office and Jamaat Khana, the raiding party comprised DSP Safar Dawach, Sujawal SHO Sajjad Jamali, Jati SHO Parhiyal Panh­war, Chuhar Jamali SHO Qurban Qambrani and teams of their respective subordinate personnel.
Finally Ghorabari DSP Izhar Hussain held negotiations with representatives of the protesting community members and assured them of appropriate action against any officer or personnel found guilty of excesses. On his assurance, the protesters dispersed peacefully.

The USAID’s collaboration and assistance including will not only strengthen vital infrastructure but also enhance resilience of communities against natural disasters,” he said.
Mr Tribble appreciated Hesco’s efforts for maintaining supply of electricity immediately after floods despite on the ground challenges. “US government’s assistance to Hesco is just one facet of our broader support to Pakistan’s energy sector. Our energy partnership is now more critical than ever as we work together to mitigate effects of climate change - our greatest long term global challenge,” he said. 
Over the past decade, USAID had been instrumental in introducing innovative technologies and providing extensive training to government officials across Pakistan and this comprehensive support not only enhanced the reliability of electricity access but also supported economic growth, said the press release.
