• Both sides agree to ban terror outfits; COAS stresses need for better coordination along border
• Iranian president pushes for activation of ‘trade in border areas’; eight MoUs signed
• Shehbaz, Raisi call for efforts towards unconditional ceasefire in Gaza
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran on Monday committed to increasing their annual trade volume to $10 billion over the next five years, as part of an understanding to deepen relations across all sectors.
This was agreed during a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iran­ian President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi, who is on a three-day visit to Pakistan leading a delegation comprising cabinet ministers, senior officials, and business representatives.
In addition, the interior ministers of both countries decided in principle to ban terrorist organisations in their respective countries, while also increasing cooperation in border management, including steps for prevention of smuggling and drugs trafficking, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
President Raisi, in his media statement, described the current level of bilateral trade as “unacceptable” and “as a first step” decided to raise this to $10 billion. The new target set by the two leaders looks highly ambitious given that the trade between the two countries last year stood at about $2.3 billion despite a significant boost in trade after the two countries signed MoUs for facilitating bilateral trade in Jan 2023.
Later in August, the two sides chalked out a five-year trade plan for realising the 2021 goal of increasing trade to $5 billion.
Since 2005, the two countries have been operating under a preferential trade agreement and have been negotiating a free trade agreement, which many anticipated would be concluded during the Iranian president’s visit.
Several factors have impeded trade growth between Iran and Pakistan, including international sanctions on Iran, security issues in border regions, and inadequate border infrastructure as well as economic misalignment.
Moreover, banking and payment issues due to the lack of direct banking channels and the necessity to comply with international financial regulations hinder smooth economic interactions.
Fluctuating political and diplomatic relations influenced by external geopolitical pressures also affect the execution of bilateral trade agreements. The two sides, which share nearly 900km of border, are specifically eyeing the development of border markets to increase trade.
Border trade

In his media remarks, Mr Raisi highlighted the long border between the two neighbouring countries as a significant opportunity for enhancing bilateral relations. He acknowledged that some measures have already been taken to facilitate border trade, but described these efforts as “insufficient”.
Emphasising the need for further action, he advocated for additional steps to “activate trade and business in border areas”. President Raisi expressed that increasing commercial activity along the border would not only improve security but also boost the welfare of the communities residing in these regions.
Pakistan and Iran had in May last year inaugurated the Mand-Pishin market, one of the planned six border markets that are to be jointly constructed by the two countries.
Separately, in a meeting bet­ween Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and his Iranian counterpart Dr Ahmad Vahidi, both agreed on a joint plan of action to deal with the menace of terrorism by further improving mutual support and exchange of intelligence information. Both sides also resolved to sign a security agreement in this regard.
It was also decided to provide all possible facilities to the Pakistani pilgrims on the occasion of Arba’een. The Iranian interior minister extended an invitation to his Pakistani counterpart to visit Iran in that regard where the Iraqi counterpart would also be invited.
Pak-Iran gas pipeline
It was widely expected that the leaders of both countries would in their meetings discuss the fate of the stalled Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline especially after Islamabad earlier this year decided to construct an 80km line within its territory to pre-empt Tehran from initiating arbitration in international courts that could potentially lead to a penalty of $18 billion.
“Probably, you can find some individuals who do not favour expansion and promotion of good bilateral relations between Iran and Pakistan but who cares? It is not important,” Mr Raisi said referring to the critics of Pak-Iran ties.
A PMO statement also mentioned a commitment by both leaders to expanding cooperation in the energy sector, but did not specify any project.
Security along Pak-Iran border

Border security also remains a significant area of contention between the two countries. This region has become a breeding ground for drug trafficking, smuggling, and the movement of militant groups.
Tensions escalated in January when Iran struck suspected militant hideouts inside Pakis­tan. In response, Pakistan targeted sanctuaries of suspected Baloch separatists in Iran, leading to a temporary downgrade of diplomatic ties. However, both countries quickly acted to mend the rift.
Mr Raisi cursorily touched on the issue noting the commonality of views on fighting terrori­­sm, organised crime, narco-trafficking and other manifestations of instability. According to the PMO statement, PM Shehbaz and President Raisi agreed to “develop joint approaches to confront common challenges including the threat of terrorism.”
Meeting with army chief
In another meeting President Raisi discussed regional stability and border security with Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir.
According to an ISPR statement, both sides concurred on the necessity to bolster bilateral cooperation while jointly striving for regional stability and economic prosperity.
Gen Munir emphasised the need to improve coordination along the border to prevent terrorists from jeopardising the longstanding relations between the two neighboring countries, ISPR said.
Gaza crisis
Both PM Shehbaz and President Raisi in their comments expressed strong and unequivocal condemnation of the ongoing genocide in Gaza by Israel and reiterated the call for international efforts to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.
Though PM Shehbaz reminded Mr Raisi of Iran’s support for the Kashmir cause, the Iranian leader avoided mentioning that in his comments.
Separately, Foreign Minis­ter Ishaq Dar called on Mr Raisi after his arrival at the Nur Khan Airbase. He also met President Asif Zardari. President Raisi will also travel to Lahore and Karachi.
Eight MoUs signed
Pakistan and Iran signed eight MoUs aimed at enhancing bilateral cooperation across a broad spectrum of areas.
These agreements, signed in the presence of PM Shehbaz and President Raisi, included a security cooperation agreement to bolster mutual security measures and an agreement on judicial assistance focusing on civil matters to enhance legal collaboration.
Additionally, an agreement to promote film exchange and cooperation in the audio-visual sectors was established, marking a significant step towards cultural exchange.

1,"13 ‘terrorists’ killed in KP, Balochistan in 48 hours","ISPR says 11 dead in Dera Ismail Khan, North Waziristan; two ‘militants’ killed in ongoing operation in Pishin highlands.","PESHAWAR / QUETTA: Security forces on Tuesday claimed to have eliminated thirteen alleged terrorists in three operations in Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, over the past 48 hours.
A statement issued by the military’s media wing said that 11 alleged terrorists were killed in two int­e­lligence-based operations (IBOs) in Dera Ismail Khan and North Waziris­tan on Monday and Tuesday.
Ten of them were gun­ned down in D.I. Khan, where seven Customs officers have been slain by unidentified attackers in the last six days.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) read that security forces carried out the operation following intellige­nce reports about the presence of alleged terrorists.

ISPR says 11 dead in D.I. Khan, North Waziristan; two ‘militants’ killed in ongoing operation in Pishin highlands

“After an intense fire exchange, ten terrorists were successfully neutralised,” it added.
Separately, one alleged militant was gunned down in North Waziristan district, ISPR said, adding that arms and ammunition were also recovered from the alleged militants’ possession.
“The killed terrorists remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area against security forces as well as the innocent civilians,” the statement read.
This is the second operation launched by security in North Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan, in less than a week.
On April 17, the military claimed to have thwarted an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by killing seven militants who were trying to cross into Pakistan.
Two ‘terrorists’ killed in Pishin
In Balochistan’s Pishin district, two alleged terrorists were killed and several injured in a gun battle with the security forces on Monday.
According to officials, the local administration received information about the presence of terrorists in the Sanzalai mountain range of Pishin, following which an operation was planned.
As security forces, including personnel of Frontier Corps, Levies and Police, closed in on the terrorists’ hideout, they opened fire.
Following a heavy exchange of fire, which lasted for an hour, two terrorists were killed, according to Pishin Deputy Commissioner Jumma Dad Mandokhail.
He also said that some terrorists were reportedly injured in the gun battle.
According to DC Mandokhail, the deceased terrorists were involved in the March 27 attack on security forces, in which a Levies risaldar had embraced martyrdom.
The encounter between security forces and suspects in the Killi Manzari area of Pishin also left four Levies officials injured. Following the gun battle, the terrorists had escaped into the Sanzalai mountain range.
DC Mandokhail added that the operation was ongoing against the alleged terrorists in the area and will continue until they are “completely eliminated”.
Meanwhile, the officials of the Frontier Corps (North) have claimed that the terrorists had crossed into Pishin from Afghanistan and had established their pickets on top of the hills.
Locals have also been informed about the terrorists’ presence in the mountains and cautioned against going into the area due to the ongoing operation.
Locals should not extend any help to these terrorists, FC officials warned.

2,"Why wasn’t cipher shown to trial court, IHC judge asks FIA",Justice Aurangzeb notes that the cipher could be produced before the judge in a confidential manner.,"ISLAMABAD: The Isla­mabad High Court (IHC) asked the special prosecutor of the Federal Investi­ga­tion Agency (FIA) on Monday why a copy of the cipher or its content had not been shared with the trial court judge, when the entire proceedings in the cipher case revolved aro­u­nd that single document.
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb made this observation while hearing the appeals of ex-premier Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi against their conviction in the cipher case.
A special court, established under the Official Secrets Act, handed both Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi 10-year jail sentences each in the case after Judge Abual Hasnat Zulqarnain appo­inted a state counsel for them.
The cipher case pertains to a diplomatic document that the FIA’s charge sheet alleges was never returned by then-PM Imran Khan, who long held that the document contained a threat from the US to topple his government.
As member of the division bench that also comprised IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, Justice Aurangzeb noted that the cipher could be produced before the judge in a confidential manner.
The bench was of the opinion that since the proceeding in this matter is criminal in nature, the benefit of doubt will go in fav­our of the accused persons.
Earlier, FIA’s special prosecutor Hamid Ali Shah informed the bench that the missing cipher was a ‘Grade-II’ classified document and disclosure of its contents compromised its security protocol.
“Every coded communication is considered a secret document,” he reasoned.
During the course of arguments, the FIA counsel defined the cipher and its security protocol. He also submitted a booklet about the security protocol for cipher and apprised the court that the booklet was issued for ‘official use only’.
Earlier on Jan 18, only weeks before the Feb 8 general elections, former principal secretary Azam Khan testified before the special court that the cipher never returned to his office.
The former bureaucurat claimed he had intimated the then prime minister, his military secretary as well as the relevant staff numerous times.
Four days later, former foreign secretary Sohail Mehmood appeared before the trial court, claiming that the copy sent to ex-PM Khan was never returned while Mr Qureshi said he returned the copy to the ministry and the ex-secretary replied in the affirmative.
On the other hand, Mr Khan had claimed that the cipher was still with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he had received only a rephrased version of the diplomatic cable.
However, the FIA special prosecutor told the IHC bench on Monday that the original copy of cipher remained in the custody of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the transcript was sent to the designated offices, adding that those copies were destroyed upon return.
The court adjourned further hearing till Tuesday (today).

3,IHC full court to take up ‘meddling’ issue today,Proposals to be submitted to apex court may be finalised by 25th.,"ISLAMABAD: A full court meeting of the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) will deliberate upon proposals on Tuesday (today) to finalise the same before their submission to the Supreme Court in a matter related to the alleged meddling by personnel of intelligence agencies in judicial affairs.
Interestingly, six of the eight IHC judges who will take stock of the issue and come up with recommendations are themselves the complainant in this regard before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
According to a notice circulated among all the eight judges by the IHC registrar office, the meeting will be convened on April 23, at 2:30pm.
The Supreme Court had initiated suo motu proceeding on the letter of six of the eight IHC judges against the alleged meddling in the judicial affairs. In its April 3 order, the SC called for proposals from the main stakeholders in the judicial system and the independence of judiciary, namely the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), high courts and the federal government.

Proposals to be submitted to apex court may be finalised by 25th

“They should suggest what should be the institutional response and mechanism to address the issues like the ones raised in the letter [of IHC judges] and ensure that such issues do not arise in future and, if they do, to fix liability and proceed against those responsible,” the order stated. In any such process, it added, the idea was to empower the high courts and their chief justices to deal with issues relating to the judges.
Since the apex court had sought the proposal by April 25, sources said the IHC registrar office circulated the apex court order among the judges and sought their final proposal by the deadline. The IHC administration will then file a consolidated report to the SC.
Initially, a seven-member larger SC bench had conducted a hearing on the suo motu proceedings.
Justice Yahya Afridi, however, recused himself from hearing this case, stating: “This may affect the functioning of the worthy chief justice and judges in their discharge of judicial functions, and would to my mind amount to interference in the independence of high courts.”
“To proceed on the proposed action of suo motu would negate the lessons moved into action by public sentiments no matter how pressing the issue may appear,” Justice Afridi emphasised, adding that one must also not ignore that the high courts under the Constitution were independent establishments envisaged to regulate not only their administrative functions, but also provide security to and safeguard the judicial officers in the discharge of their judicial functions.“
In their letter, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz had hinted at the alleged involvement of ISI in judicial matters.

5,NA witnesses rare ‘give-and-take’ goodwill gestures,Govt moves motion to restore PTI MNAs’ membership; opposition agrees to join house business advisory committee.,"ISLAMABAD: In a surprise display of conciliation in the National Assembly, opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday offered “cooperation and constructive engagement” in the parliamentary proceedings, as the government made a significant goodwill gesture by withdrawing suspension of the two PTI lawmakers whose entry had been banned by the speaker due to their rowdy behaviour during the joint sitting of parliament last week.
The motion seeking the withdrawal of the suspension order against PTI MNAs Jamshed Dasti and Moham­mad Iqbal Khan was moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and it was readily app­roved by the assembly through a voice vote after reconciliatory speeches by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had suspended the membership of the two lawmakers for the remainder of the current session for “eroding the sanctity” of the assembly by “indulging in rowdy behaviour” during President Asif Zardari’s address to the joint sitting of parliament on April 18.
The speaker had given his ruling after seeking the house approval on a motion through a voice vote and he repeated the same action on Monday for withdrawal of his previous order.

Govt moves motion to restore PTI MNAs’ membership; opposition agrees to join house business advisory committee

This unexpected thaw in relations sparked some optimism among lawmakers, paving the way for a more harmonious and productive parliamentary session. However, the speech of fiery PTI MNA from Karak Shahid Khattak indicated that this cooperation might not last long or perhaps was part of a strategic move ahead of the formation of the standing committees.
Shortly before the adjournment of the sitting till Tuesday evening, Mr Khattak while speaking on a point of order categorically announced they would not let this house run till the release of their founding chairman Imran Khan from the jail.
“We are being given Bhaashan (lectures) that we want to run this house. If Imran Khan is not released, we will not let this house run,” declared MNA Khattak. He said if it was a sin to call “mandate thieves and vote thieves” to those who had come to the power through rigging, then he would continue to repeat it.
PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri, who took the floor after his speech, said it seemed there were some lawmakers who did not want this assembly to discuss the issues being faced by the people. She termed it inappropriate to link parliament’s functioning with someone’s release. She also castigated the opposition members for their noisy protest during the oath-taking of Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, reminding the house that some members had attempted to “sabotage the constitutional process” of oath-taking.
At the outset, leader of the opposition Omar Ayub Khan requested the speaker to review decision of suspending the two PTI lawmakers as per his commitment during a meeting with the opposition members’ delegation in his chamber.
The PTI leader then raised the issue of alleged rigging in by-polls, held on April 21.
PTI’s chief whip Aamir Dogar said that recording their protest in parliament was their democratic right and they would continue to do so. He recalled that in the previous assembly, the opposition members also brought whistles and trumpets during the protests, but the then speaker Asad Qaiser showed patience and did not take any action against them.
Mr Dogar asked the speaker to withdraw the suspension orders of both legislators, stating that the opposition members were ready to become a part of the house business advisory committee to discuss the ways and means to improve the atmosphere in the assembly. He expressed the hope that the speaker would take steps to take the members from both sides on board in order to improve the environment.
The chief whip of the opposition party also welcomed the visiting Iranian president and lauded Iran for giving a “befitting response” to Israel that, he said, was “the biggest terrorist” in the world.
Speaker Ayaz Sadiq expla­ined that when he received an invitation from the Iranian president for a meeting, he told them that he would come with a parliamentary delegation representing all the parties. He expressed his pleasure that both the government and the opposition members gave a ‘positive message’ to the Iranian president that despite having differences within themselves, they were united for the cause of Pakistan and to give honour to the guests.
PPP’s Naveed Qamar and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar of the PML-N welcomed the opposition’s offer for cooperation and endorsed its demand that the disciplinary action taken against the two PTI MNAs should be withdrawn.
JUI-F lawmaker
Earlier, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) lawmaker Aliya Kamran while speaking on a point of order asked the speaker to expel MNA Sadaf Ihsan from the house after the Supreme Court’s decision of suspending the Peshawar High Court’s verdict in her favour. She said the JUI-F had actually given ticket to another woman with the same name, but she could not submit her nomination papers.
She alleged that taking advantage of the situation, Ms Ihsan “fraudulently” managed to seek the NA seat on the JUI-F reserved seat.
The JUI-F member, sitting on the opposition benches, asked the speaker to declare her “alien” and order her expulsion from the house.
However, Ms Ihsan, who was sitting on the treasury benches, claimed she had been awarded the ticket by Maulana Fazlur Rehman himself. She said she had come to the assembly for the cause of Pakistan and her constituency, Lakki Marwat.
