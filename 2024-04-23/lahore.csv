1,Woman poisoned to death by parents for ‘honour’ in Punjab’s Arifwala,Police say both suspects have confessed to their crime.,"SAHIWAL: A married woman was allegedly poisoned to death by her parents for honour in village 111/EB, Arifwala, on Sunday.
The Ahmedyar police arrested Sadiqan Bibi and her husband Subhae Sadiq on the complaint of deceased Bisma Kausar’s husband Nasir Ahmed. The police said both suspects have confessed to their crime.
According to reports, six months ago, Bisma, of village 111/EB, was married to Nasir in village 79/EB. Allegedly, Bisma was not willing to marry Nasir and had an affair with Imran, a fellow villager.
After the marriage, Bisma eloped with Imran, prompting her mother Sadiqan to file a case against Ismail and Imran at Arifwala Saddar police. However, Bisma, in court, testified in favour of Imran and Ismail, claiming that she had left Nasir’s house due to mistreatment.
The case was dropped and Bisma was returned to her parents’ home.
A few days ago, Nasir requested Bisma’s parents to return her, to which they reluctantly agreed. However, Bisma refused to return to Nasir’s house, to which her parents administered poisonous pills to her in her food. The police shifted the body to Arifwala Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
RAID: Commissioner Shoaib Iqbal ordered the replacement of the entire examination staff at the Government Graduate College examination center due to “poor efficiency and vigilance” on Monday.
Naveed Azamt, the controller of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, confirmed to Dawn that a new staff comprising six personnel had been appointed before the commencement of the evening paper.
Reports said suggest that the commissioner, who holds dual charge as board chairman, observed lax vigilance and witnessed the unauthorized use of mobile phones outside the examination centre. Out of nine educational boards in Punjab, seven are administered by commissioners who hold dual roles as board chairmen.
Only Rawalpindi and Multan boards have chairmen, while Sahiwal, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, and Lahore are overseen by bureaucrats.

The entire town, along with dozens of students, blocked the road, 15km from the incident site, blocking traffic in both directions. Hundreds of vehicles, including passenger and cargo vehicles, were stranded on both sides of the road.  
A large contingent of police arrived at the scene to prevent any potential unrest.
The protesters, expressing their frustration towards the local police and the Punjab government for their failure to bring the culprits to justice, demanded the transfer of the Mooch station house officer as well as the deputy superintendent of police and the district police officer.
After four hours of negotiations between local administration officials and the demonstrators, protesters ended blockade, with assurances given that the culprits would be arrested within days.

6,Wheat farmers in south Punjab caught in a rock and hard place,Govt reluctant to procure wheat while local market offers peanuts,"LAHORE: Despite the wheat harvesting season nearing its end in south Punjab, millions of farmers in the region are in a predicament as the government has not yet started procurement despite fixing the support price at Rs3,900 per maund while the local market was offering even a lesser price for their produce. In such a situation, the farmers are stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea.  
The procurement target to two million metric tonnes set by the Punjab Food Department for the year 2024-25 is already less than half of the previous year as the government currently has a carryover wheat stock of 20 million metric tonnes. 
Waqar Gondal, a farmer from tehsil Jatoi, told Dawn that he had cultivated wheat on 35 acres after the district administration and food department launched campaigns to cultivate the crop. He said he was told by the bureaucracy on wheat cultivation month that the government would purchase all the wheat from the farmers in the province and would also offer a better price.  
“However, the government first did not announce a good wheat support price (Rs3,900 per maund) and then it delayed purchasing wheat.” 

Govt reluctant to procure wheat while local market offers peanuts

Gondal said the government should have announced the support price around Rs6,000 per maund and provided gunny bags to the farmers at the start of April but thousands of farmers who had harvested their crop had not received a single bag yet. He said he himself needed 2,000 bags to sell his wheat. 
Criticising the government of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, he said that the CM was celebrating Baisakhi festival but did not start wheat procurement where harvesting had been done. 
“The farmers would not be able to sow cotton if all their wheat is lying in the fields. And if their wheat produce is not purchased, they won’t have any money to cultivate the cotton,” Gondal shared his apprehensions. 
Besides, the government had only announced to purchase wheat only from the farmers having six acres of land, he lamented. 
About the rate of wheat, Gondal claimed that the local market was offering Rs3,100 per maund, which was akin to ruining all of farmers’ produce and they would prefer to set the wheat on fire instead of selling at such a low rate. 
Another farmer, Sardar Afzal Khan, told Dawn that his tehsil Alipur falls under the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation Ltd (PASSCO) and he had held meetings with the corporation officials to get bags to sell his wheat. He alleged that the officials were willing to give bags only after getting Rs400 per bag.  
“We also have offered the officials to give Rs200 per bag but giving Rs400 per bag would leave us in deficit.” 
Khan alleged that the coalition government in Islamabad and PML-N government in Punjab were trying to kill the farmers and it was the history of the PML-N that it would always facilitate the middleman (traders) and not the farmers. 
He said the wheat procurement had not started yet and they were covering their wheat in the open while the weather conditions were also turning against them and it was a risk to keep wheat in the fields. 
Meanwhile, PTI Senator and the party president of south Punjab Aon Abbas Buppi along with other leaders addressed a press conference at the Multan Press Club. He highlighted the PTI’s stance on farmers’ issues, emphasizing the urgent need to address the significant problem of wheat price in south Punjab. 
“The current wheat pricing crisis has pushed farmers to the brink, with wheat being priced at Rs2,700 per maund in the Bahawalpur  region. In contrast, during the PTI’s tenure, wheat was priced at Rs3,900, demonstrating the party’s commitment to resolving farmers’ issues.” 
Buppi talked about the international pressure, prompting the purchase of wheat from Ukraine and demanded an inquiry against those who profited from the wheat bought from Ukraine.  
The government imported 3.2 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat at the cost of Rs3,100 per maund and subsequently sold in the market for Rs4,500.  
Meanwhile, the government has stockpiled four million tonnes of local wheat in its warehouses, exacerbating the crisis for local farmers. The imported wheat has been sold in the market while local wheat is being neglected. 
Senator Buppi warned that if the government fails to address farmers’ concerns, it could lead to a severe wheat crisis in Pakistan, possibly resulting in farmers refraining from wheat cultivation next year. He announced that his party would support the farmers and hold peaceful protests against the injustice to the wheat farmers. The protest rally would commence from Multan and move towards Lahore, where thousands of farmers would bring their wheat on tractor-trolleys to block Lahore.

9,First woman to head Government College University in 160 years,Prof Bashir has been serving GCU Lahore since 1996 and was previously dean of the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.,"LAHORE: In an unprecedented move, the Punjab government has appointed Professor Dr Shazia Bashir as the acting vice chancellor (VC) of the Government College University (GCU) — the first woman in the university’s 160-year history to have this position.
Prof Bashir, a former Ravian, has been serving GCU Lahore since 1996 and was previously the dean of the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. She has an extensive academic background, with a Master’s degree in Physics from the Government College Lahore, an MPhil from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, and a PhD from the Technical University, Vienna, Austria.
Her tenure as the director of the Centre for Advanced Studies in Physics and Institute of Physics and Chairperson, Department of Physics, has been marked by significant contributions to research and development in the field. She has more than 150 research publications appearing in reputed international journals to her credit.
The appointment, conferred by Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman, is for a period of four months or until the appointment of a regular VC. The faculty, staff, and students have welcomed this historic appointment.
However, this appointment comes amidst a leadership crisis in Punjab’s public sector universities. At least 29 of these institutions are currently operating without regular VCs, leading to a host of academic and administrative issues.
The Higher Education Department (HED), which administers 34 public universities in the province, has seen the tenure of regular VCs at 22 universities expire one and a half years ago and four others more than six months ago. Three new universities established by the government also require the appointment of VCs.
The lack of permanent leadership has raised concerns among the academic staff associations of the universities, which believe that absence of regular VCs is compromising the standards of education and research in these varsities.
The most important positions, including VCs, registrar, treasurers, and controllers of examinations, have been lying vacant in many universities in the province.
On March 24, Governor Balighur Rehman had written a letter to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, urging her to make permanent appointments to important posts, including those of VCs, across the province.
The interim government had issued advertisements for the vacant posts of VCs and constituted search committees for interviewing the candidates for the slots.
However, the process remained incomplete as it was challenged in court with the argument that the interim government could not hire VCs under the law.
Sources claim that HED officers are reluctant to re-advertise the posts and want to fill them based on the previous advertisement.
This lapse in statutory tenures has disrupted the varsities’ core functions, such as academic processes, administrative controls, decision-making, and financial management. Currently, these universities are being run by pro-VCs or VCs having additional or acting charge.
Prof Bashir is also third acting vice chancellor of the GCU, as the Punjab government has again failed to tackle the larger issue of vacant posts of VCs in the universities of the province.

10,GOR house eviction notice issued to PC deputy chief,Jehanzeb Khan managed to get extension twice in relaxation of policy,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has eventually issued an eviction notice to Planning Commission (PC) Deputy Chairman Jehanzeb Khan to vacate the 16-Golf Road residence in GOR-I. 
The eviction order has been issued after Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz rejected Mr Khan’s request for extension of GOR residence. 
The notice issued to Mr Khan says he was retired from government service on Aug 1, 2020 on attaining the age of superannuation while the GOR-1 residence was under his occupation. After expiry of six months permissible extension period, Mr Khan was granted one-year extension up to April 1, 2022 in compliance with chief minister’s direction. Thereafter, Mr Khan was again granted further one-year extension up to April 1, 2023 in relaxation of policy in compliance with CM’s direction. 
Subsequently, upon receipt of chief minister’s March 25, 2023 directive for grant of further extension from April 1, 2023, the Punjab government had initiated a summary for the chief minister. However, the competent authority did not allow further extension in favour of Mr Khan and his status in the said residence was converted into an unauthorised occupant with effect from April 2, 2023, says the vacation order. 

Jehanzeb Khan managed to get extension twice in relaxation of policy

The Punjab government, through the notice, observed that Mr Khan had already been served upon vacation notice on Sept 7 followed by legal ejectment notice on Sept 27 last year but he had yet not vacated the residence. 
The Punjab government has asked Mr Khan to “vacate the 16-Golf Road GOR-1 within three days positively as stipulated period of vacation notice and legal ejectment notice has already been expired”. 
The GOR-1’s 16-Golf Road residence was allotted to former Punjab chief secretary Abdullah Khan Sumbal on July 20, 2022, with a direction that the allotment order for Deputy Chairman Planning Commission of Pakistan Jehanzeb Khan stands cancelled. 
Mr Sumbal, who was residing with his parents in Lahore Cantt, however allowed Mr Khan to continue staying in the GOR-1 residence. The situation took an unfortunate turn with the death of Mr Sumbal on Sept 6 last year and his wife eventually left stranded and needed the allotted GOR-1 residence. 
The Punjab government on Nov 21 last year formally allowed Mr Sumbal’s widow Dr Ainul Momina to retain the 16-Golf Road residence till Jan 21, 2030 – the date of superannuation of the late Mr Sumbal. However, Mr Khan did not vacate the house and instead applied for extension. 
In support of the late Sumbal’s wife Dr Momina, a Harvard graduate, the caretaker Punjab cabinet had also taken up the case in its 37th meeting on Jan 24 this year and agreed to get the illegal possession vacated from Mr Jehanzeb Khan and grant the possession to Dr Momina. But the matter yet again saw a grinding halt as Mr Khan applied for extension in his residence’s possession. 
Mr Khan’s move for not relinquishing possession of the house already allotted to Mr Sumbal had drawn a strong resentment among the bureaucrats fraternity. Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman had also acknowledged that Mr Jehanzeb Khan had applied for re-extension but such an extension was not permitted under the rules. 
It is learnt the cabinet standing committee for law and order will also determine “penal rent” for the period Mr Khan kept the residence in his possession beyond the legal allotment period.

12,Posting of junior officer as DIG operations gets sideways glance,"Posting, done on Nawaz’ recommendations, overlooked many BPS-20 officers to favour a BPS-19 officer","LAHORE: The Punjab government has appointed a junior police officer as new DIG Operations Lahore (BPS-20), leaving many officers, particularly those serving in BPS-20, shocked over the choice of the PML-N government. 
Faisal Kamran (BPS-19) from 36th Common was serving as district police officer (DPO) Sargodha when he was transferred and posted as DIG Operations Lahore on Monday against the BPS-20 slot vice Ali Nasir Rizvi who had been posted as IG police Islamabad. 
The sources, privy to the development, said Mr Kamran was appointed on recommendations of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif who suggested his name to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The officer had served him as chief security officer (CSO) in 2016-17 when he was the prime minister. Since then, Mr Kamran has remained in the good books of Nawaz, the sources said. 

Posting, done on Nawaz’ recommendations, overlooked many BPS-20 officers to favour a BPS-19 officer

There are also some reports that IGP Usman Anwar was unwilling to give him the abovementioned posting. But despite his reluctance, the Punjab government bypassed several BPS-20 officers and many in BPS-19 who were from 34th Common but had at least done the senior management course (SMC), the sources said. Faisal Kamran (BPS-19) has yet to do SMC course and he and his other batchmates serving in Punjab may take five to six years for promotion to the rank of DIG (BPS-20), an official source said. The SMC is mandatory for capacity-building of the potential officers with a view to enhancing their knowledge, skills, attitude and leadership ability to formulate, evaluate, implement and monitor public policies at the strategic level to improve the service delivery. 
Kamran’s colleagues from the same 36th common, including Abadat Nisar, Sardar Ghias Gill and Tariq Wilayat, are serving as the DPOs of Toba Tek Singh, Attock and Pakpattan, respectively, which are relatively the low profile districts. Another officer, Syed Khalid Mahmood Hamdani, is serving as the CPO Rawalpindi. 
The source said many senior colleagues of Kamran from 34th Common have completed the SMC last year and qualified for promotion to the next grade. Of them, Ali Zia is serving as CPO Faisalabad, Hassan Sukhera in Intelligence Bureau, Ammara Athar as CTO Lahore and Sahibzada Bilal Umar as assistant inspector general (AIG) development at the Central Police Office. No one from them was even discussed for the DIG Operations post Lahore. 
The Punjab government also blatantly bypassed several police officers already serving in BPS-20. The names of two of them had come under discussion for replacement of Ali Nasir Rizvi. 
The officers, including Gujranwala CPO Ayyaz Saleem, Lahore Organized Crime Unit (OCU) Imran Kishwar, were also in the race. Another BPS-20 officer Sadiq Dogar, serving as Multan CPO a relatively junior position, could also be a choice for the Lahore post. 
The source has termed the DIG Operations Lahore slot highly sensitive and important, requiring a designated BPS-20 officer as per the Police Order 2002. He says the posting of a junior officer could be overlooked in smaller districts or on non-field assignments but the same can’t be done in Lahore, which reports over 350,000 crimes annually and deals with law and order situations, particularly being a hub of political unrest. 
The source says the police circles have termed posting of Faisal Kamran a disappointing at a time when CM Maryam Nawaz had announced that she believed in upholding merit.

13,‘Flawed’ wheat procurement: Growers to stage sit-in outside PA on 29th,"BAHAWALPUR: Terming the government’s wheat procurement policy flawed, the farmers’ associations of south Punjab...","BAHAWALPUR: Terming the government’s wheat procurement policy flawed, the farmers’ associations of south Punjab have announced to stage a joint protest outside the Punjab Assembly on April 29.    
The hard-hit middle-class growers in the districts of Bahawalpur, Vehari and Lodhran, with claims of high per acre wheat yield, say they have been forced to lodge protest against the government’s wheat procurement policy.
They are demanding that the government should do away with “complicated” Baradna APP, which had been introduced for “transparent” distribution of empty gunny bags among the farmers.   
They also demand that food department’s procurement centres should be allowed open purchase so that farmers could sell all their yield at official price and avert financial losses.
In Vehari, the wheat growers staged a demo jointly organised by different bodies representing farmers against the government’s procurement policy.
On the occasion, the Pakisan Kissan Ittehad central secretary general Chaudhry Iftikhar Ahmed announced to stage a joint sit-in comprising farmers from across south Punjab on April 29 outside the Punjab Assembly.
He said the sit-in would be continued till the acceptance of the farmers’ demands, warning the government that if any attempt was made to disrupt the protest, they would stage sit-ins in every district of the province. He criticised the import of wheat despite the huge stocks of the grain produced locally lying in the government’s godowns. 
Similarly, Pakistan Kissan Board central president Jam Hazoor Baksh said that because of the government’s flawed procurement policy, the wheat growers were now forced to sell their produce to the agents from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and upper Punjab, who were visiting the grain markets of south Punjab to purchase wheat at cheaper rates.
In Ahmedpur East, farmers Mushtaq Ahmed Sahoo and others say that as the government failed to announce open wheat procurement policy, the growers were compelled to sell their stocks at throwaway prices, bearing loss of about Rs600 to Rs700 per maund. Presently, he said the rates of wheat in the open market have fallen to Rs3,100 or Rs3,200 per maund, mocking the government’s support price of Rs3,900. 
Pakistan Seraiki Party (PSP) has also criticised the government’s policy and pledged to join the protest on April 29 in Lahore.

The police produced both women before the court on expiry of their judicial remand. Judge Arshad Javed extended the judicial remand till May 6 and the police took them back to the Sargodha jail. 
Last week, an ATC of Sargodha had discharged Ms Malik and Ms Javed from the charges related to inciting people in Mianwali to invade the state institutions on May 9, 2023. However, they were remanded in another case. 

Ex-MNA says she was on four-day hunger strike over lack of facilities

Talking to the reporters, Ms Malik said the PTI was not damaged by the results of the by-elections. 
“These people are happy to win the election through fraud,” she said. 
She alleged that Form 45 was already signed before the completion of the election process and fake results were prepared. 
The former parliamentarian said the PTI’s workers were not afraid of imprisonment and they would not surrender. 
“They cannot force us to leave the party by keeping us in custody. We will stand with the PTI founder in all circumstances.” 
Ms Malik said she went on a hunger strike for four days in Sargodha jail due to lack of basic facilities. 
Both women, who are in jail for over nine months, have been granted bail in several May 9 cases, including the attack on the Jinnah House and burning PML-N office in Model Town.
