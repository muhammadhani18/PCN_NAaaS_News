1,PTI denies receiving invitation for reconciliation talks,"Gohar says PTI has not been contacted for any negotiation, refutes secret discussions","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan denied receiving any formal invitation from the government for reconciliation talks, following a statement made by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Rana Sanaullah on the matter.
While speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, Barrister Gohar asserted that PTI had not been contacted for any negotiation, refuting rumours of ongoing secret discussions. If a genuine invitation were received, the party would publicly acknowledge it, he said.
He highlighted that the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan has also confirmed that he did not receive any message for dialogue. Gohar rejected any notion of holding secret talks with the government, emphasising that his party is open to dialogue but not in a concealed manner.
Commenting on the recent by-elections held in 21 national and provincial assemblies’ constituencies, Gohar criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for failing to conduct free and transparent elections, particularly in Punjab.
He alleged that ballot boxes were filled before the polling process and that the results were pre-planned. He announced that PTI would stage peaceful protests on Friday against the by-election rigging.
Discussing the recent hearing of the cipher case against Imran Khan, Gohar criticised the process, highlighting that the prosecutor presented 21 witnesses in a 14-hour hearing, but Khan’s lawyers were not given a chance to present evidence.
Regarding the cases against Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, he stated that she had no connection with the Toshakhana case and was targeted to pressure the PTI leader.
Meanwhile during an informal interaction with the media during a hearing in the 190-million-pound case, PTI founding chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan criticised the current state of governance in Pakistan, stating that the ""law of the jungle"" is prevalent in the country.
He accused Punjab Police of interfering in the April 21 by-elections, suggesting that the elections in Punjab seemed to have been ""contested by Punjab Police."" Khan contrasted this with the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where PTI holds power, noting that there were no complaints of rigging, no FIRs filed, and no arrests made in that province.
Imran Khan emphasised that the ongoing issues stem from a lack of the rule of law, and he announced that PTI will stage peaceful protests in all constituencies of Pakistan on Friday in response to the electoral irregularities.
The former prime minister also questioned why returning officers were not sourced from the judiciary, despite repeated requests from opposition parties. He criticised the ECP for failing to conduct transparent and fair elections, asserting that it is the people's right to choose their representatives.
Khan stated that PTI would not allow a ""drama"" under the guise of elections, reiterating the need for a fair electoral process.
A day earlier during a talk show, PML-N's Sanaullah had extended a reconciliation offer to Imran Khan, suggesting that joint efforts could help overcome the nation's multiple challenges, including economic and political crises. He urged Khan to engage in dialogue, warning that escalating political tensions could further destabilise the country's fragile economy.

2,PM suspends taxman for negligence in court case,Prime Minister’s Office says Shehbaz takes notice of wilful delay,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif suspended a senior taxman on Tuesday on a complaint from judiciary of seeking an adjournment in a tax case, which showed his commitment to resolve the disputed tax matters but caused resentment in the tax machinery.
The prime minister suspended the senior officer in a court case where no revenue was involved. The matter pertained to a stay order taken by a company from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in February last year against the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) decision to open its books.
A notification issued by the FBR said that Yousif Hyder Shaikh (IRS/BS-21) presently posted as Chief Commissioner-IR, Large Taxpayers Office, Islamabad, had been placed under suspension, with immediate effect, for a period of 120 days.
It added that the action had been taken by the competent authority in exercise of powers under the Civil Servants Efficiency and Discipline Rules. In place of Shaikh, Ishtiaq Ahmed Khan is appointed as the new chief commissioner of the Large Tax Office.
In a press statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said that Shehbaz had taken notice of the wilful delay in tax cases and ordered for suspension of the chief commissioner, Inland Revenue, Islamabad, and other relevant officials. The prime minister also asked for initiating an inquiry.
However, a senior officer at the FBR headquarters said that the prime minister’s action was disproportionate, because the adjournment in the court case was sought by the lawyer despite the FBR’s chief commissioner instructions to pursue all pending court cases.
Moreover, the matter was related to a commissioner, Sajida Kausar, but the action had been taken against the chief commissioner without first ascertaining the facts. Kausar had recently been posted after she remained without a position for a longer period.
The company involved in the case was picked by the FBR last year for the sales tax and federal excise duty audit. However, the company filed a petition in the IHC and obtained stay order against the audit notice.
In March 2023, the company had sought an adjournment in the case and it was fixed for hearing only in February this year after a gap of almost one year. However, the case was again adjourned in February due to the “paucity of time by the court on that date”, according to a report of the FBR.
After the government’s decision to expedite the pending court cases, the FBR had asked its lawyers to seek expeditious fixing of cases, particularly where the high courts had granted stay orders to the taxpayers without first hearing the FBR.
The chief justice of Pakistan had also instructed the judiciary not to delay decisions in the tax cases. It is estimated that over Rs3 trillion is disputed and the cases are pending at four judicial forums, including the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
On April 1, the FBR instructed its lawyer in the case, Muhammad Bin Majid, to file a miscellaneous petition to get the stay order vacated in the light of the directions passed by the chief justice of Pakistan to expedite the resolution of disputed tax cases.

The case was taken up by the court on April 17. However Bin Majid sought a short adjournment on the grounds that the court office had provided the relevant documents a week before the hearing.
“Learned counsel for the petitioner is ready to make his submissions. The Court is ready to hear the submissions. Respondents no.2 to 4 however are not ready, despite their complaint to the learned Attorney General’s office that the Government’s revenue is stuck due to pending litigation and the Attorney General writing to the Hon’ble Chief Justice to expedite the pending tax litigation,” according to the order issueds by Justice Ejaz Ishaq Khan.
“Let it be noted for the record that this petition was admitted on 03.02.2023 but over a year later learned counsel turns up for respondent’s no.2 to 4 stating that FBR has instructed him only recently and he needs time to prepare his brief,” according to the short court order.
During a recent interaction with the apex court judges, the prime minister had sought the Judiciary’s help for expeditious disposal of tax cases. The prime minister observed that the national exchequer had been suffering due to the pendency of such cases involving billions of rupees tax matters.
After the IHC issued the order about the FBR lawyer’s decision to seek adjournment, the FBR had sought an explanation from Bin Majid.
The lawyer explained that he appeared in the case for the first time and informed that court that he had only recently obtained the complete record of the case from the court office in the previous week and would require a short adjournment to render detailed assistance in the case, according to FBR documents.
In his explanation, the lawyer told the FBR field office that he obtained the complete record of the case from the court on April 12th. The lawyer handles over 100 cases of the FBR in various high courts. The FBR has withdrawn the power of attorney from Majid and appointed Osama Shahid as new lawyer on the case.

3,Reconstituted missing persons committee to have parliamentary presence,Law minister cautions against 'hasty solutions' driven by 'court directives or someone speaking on social media',"The federal government on Tuesday said that it had decided to reconstitute the cabinet committee on missing persons which would also have a parliamentary representation.
Addressing a news conference alongside Information Minister Attaullah Tarar in Islamabad, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said that resolving the issue of missing persons required time, stressing that it ""could not be solved overnight"" and the government was committed to achieving a consensus among all stakeholders.
The law minister emphasised the need for a comprehensive approach, cautioning against hasty solutions driven by social media pressures or court directives.
He said it could “not be solved overnight in haste or due to someone’s anxiety or someone speaking on social media platforms or even court directives”.
Highlighting the historical context, Tarar noted that Pakistan's role as a frontline state in a conflict-ridden region over the past four decades had compounded internal challenges. He underscored the sacrifices made by the Pakistani people and armed forces in combating terrorism, urging recognition of these sacrifices in addressing the issue of missing persons.
He emphasised that Pakistan's citizens and military have made significant sacrifices in combating terrorism, describing their contributions as an ""unbelievable price."" He urged that these sacrifices should be duly acknowledged in addressing the missing persons issue.
Tarar traced the government's efforts back to 2011 under the PPP government when the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was established. Subsequently, the Supreme Court intervened, forming a commission to address the matter.
Updating on progress, Tarar mentioned that out of 10,200 cases referred to the commission, 7,900 had been resolved, leaving 23 per cent pending. He also cited initiatives undertaken during the previous PML-N-led government, particularly the formation of a committee under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Under the current government, Tarar stated that directives had been issued to revive the inquiry into enforced disappearances, with plans to reconstitute the committee, now with parliamentary representation.
He acknowledged that dismissing the alleged involvement of government institutions outright might not be appropriate. However, he emphasised, ""What needs to be seen is whether, till today, any solid or concrete evidence has come. From what I saw in the report, till I was on the committee, the answer is in the negative.""
Furthermore, the law minister raised doubts about the credibility of inquiry reports, citing the example of missing persons in Sindh who were found to be serving jail time instead.
Highlighting the complexity of the issue, the law minister expressed his intention to address it through legal and political channels, aiming for consensus among all stakeholders. This sentiment was echoed by the information minister, who reaffirmed the government's commitment to resolving the matter.
In late February, days before leaving his office, former caretaker PM Anwaarul Haq Kakar had appeared before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) — after being summoned for a third time — in a case pertaining to missing Baloch students.
In a January hearing on the same case, IHC’s Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani had remarked that a day would come when intelligence officials would also be held accountable and face prosecution for cases. In a subsequent hearing, he had observed, “The punishment of enforced disappearances should be the death penalty.”
The IHC had also issued directives for constituting a joint committee of directors general of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI), and Military Intelligence (MI) for tracing the whereabouts of students from Balochistan who were allegedly missing.
However, the federal government had approached the IHC seeking to overturn the order.
Attaullah during the press conference, also praised the ruling party for the measures it has taken. Citing reports from international financial institutions and rating agencies, the minister claimed validation of the present government's economic policies aimed at achieving stability.
Read SC seeks lasting fix for missing persons’ issue
He highlighted achievements such as a surplus current account, increased foreign direct investment, and a rise in information technology (IT) exports, crediting it to PM Shehbaz's 'prudent' economic measures.
In a report released by the non-governmental organization (NGO) Defence of Human Rights (DHR) in December of the previous year, Pakistan witnessed an increase of 51 cases of enforced disappearances in 2023.
“The total number of cases stands at 3,120, with 51 cases registered in 2023 alone. Notably, 595 individuals have been released and reunited with their families, 246 people have been traced, and 88 cases have sadly resulted in extrajudicial killings,” DHR said.

Earlier, Raisi attended a ceremony at the Governor House, where he was conferred upon the honorary doctorate by the University Karachi. Speaking on the occasion, Governor Kamran Tessori said that Pakistan and Iran could learn a lot from each other’s experiences in various fields.
The governor invited Iranian investors to take advantage of the favourable investment environment in Pakistan, especially the country’s economic hub of Karachi. He also invited Iranains to invest in the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) projects.

5,"NA revives membership of SIC’s Dasti, Khan",Passes resolution calling for combating plastic pollution,"On Monday, the National Assembly Speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, reinstated the membership of two SIC lawmakers - Jamshed Dasti and Iqbal Khan - and permitted them to participate in house proceedings.
Last Friday, the NA suspended the membership of Dasti and Khan for violating Rule 30 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007.
According to the speaker, the lawmakers had used abusive language, approached the speaker’s podium in a threatening manner, blown whistles and trumpets, chanted objectionable slogans, and engaged in rowdy behaviour.
The speaker noted that such behaviour had never been witnessed before in the NA and asked the house if the membership of Dasti and Khan should be suspended for the remainder of the session. The house had voted in favour of suspending the two SIC members.
However, on Monday, Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar presented another resolution to reinstate the membership of Dasti and Khan and allow them to attend the assembly session. The house adopted the resolution with a majority vote.
Additionally, on World Earth Day, the National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution calling for coordinated efforts among citizens, organizations, and government entities to tackle the global challenge of plastic pollution.
The resolution, presented by Azam Nazeer Tarar, acknowledged the critical importance of safeguarding the planet, its environment, and its ecosystems.
It highlighted the detrimental impact of plastic pollution on Pakistan’s environment and underscored the Ministry of Climate Change's recognition of the paramount importance of preserving the environment and ecosystems.
The resolution emphasized the urgent need to combat plastic pollution, as highlighted by the theme “Planet versus Plastic,” and to safeguard the planet’s health. Plastic pollution was identified as a significant threat to Pakistan’s environment, wildlife, and public health in the resolution.

6,"Zardari, Raisi discuss Gaza, bilateral ties",Express deep concern over worsening humanitarian situation in Palestinian enclave,"Pakistan and Iran have reiterated the need for enhanced international endeavours to bring an end to Israeli genocide in Gaza. The two countries have also called for more humanitarian relief and assistance for the beleaguered people of the Palestinian enclave.

7,SC grapples with unprecedented caseload,"Total number of pending cases surged to 57,181 by March 31","The Supreme Court finds itself grappling with an unprecedented caseload and a historic high in the country's judicial history, with the backlog swelling over the past three months.
In the initial tenure of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, the apex court witnessed a commendable reduction in pending cases during the first three months of his stewardship.
According to the SC’s quarterly report covering the period from September 17, 2023, to December 16, 2023, released by CJP Isa, the number of pending cases dipped from 56,503 to 55,644. This marked a notable decline of 859 cases during his initial three months in office.
However, the situation took a downturn in the subsequent three months. As per the fortnightly report, the total number of pending cases surged to 57,181 by March 31. Alarmingly, an additional 1,537 cases were added to the overall backlog during the first quarter of this year.This comes as the initial months of CJP Isa's tenure were lauded for his internal institutional reforms, which garnered widespread appreciation and contributed to the reduction in total pending cases.
On the other hand, CJP Isa and the apex court face criticism for their January 13 ruling, which deemed the intra-party elections of PTI as illegal, stripping the party of its election symbol. Concerns have also been raised regarding the credibility of the general elections held on February 8.
Conversely, case data indicates that the performance of the apex court has been impacted since January.
In addition, the SC has been unable to evolve a strategy to reduce the massive backlog of cases. Three seats remain vacant in the apex court, with three judges departing in the last three months. Delays in filling these vacancies contribute to the backlog.
In the past three months, three judges have departed from the SC. Justices Ijazul Ahsan and Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi resigned, while Justice Sardar Tariq Masood retired last month.
However, CJP Isa has summoned a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on May 3 to consider proposed amendments in the process of appointing superior court judges.
One official in SC attributes the increase in pendency to factors such as the month of Ramazan, the shortage of judges, and the constitution of special benches. Efforts are being made to address the backlog by fixing bunches of cases, particularly revenue and tax matters involving government revenue.
Regarding the strategy to clear the significant backlog, the official explains that cases are being grouped together for resolution. Priority is being given to revenue and tax matters that impact government income.
The judicial performance of the top court over the last decade, from 2013 to 2023, reveals that the backlog of cases has increased by more than 150 per cent.
In 2013, the Supreme Court had a total of 20,116 pending cases. However, by March 31, this figure had skyrocketed to 57,181, marking an increase of over 150 per cent. Since 2017, more than 20,000 cases have been added to the total backlog.
In 2001, the number of pending cases before the SC stood at 13,070. Over the years, this figure has multiplied several times.
As of March 31, a total of 3,337 jail petitions are pending in the SC.
There is a pressing need for frequent full-court meetings to devise a strategy to address the backlog.
The performance of the SC has also been impacted by judicial politics, with factionalism evident within the institution.
Following the filing of a presidential reference against CJP Isa, the SC has become divided into two factions. However, the incumbent CJP promptly convened a full-court meeting on the very first day, breaking a three-year hiatus where no such meeting had occurred.
With the endorsement of the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act 2022, a committee of three judges is now responsible for determining the composition of benches.It has been reported that Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar were tasked with formulating the case management policy. However, it remains unclear whether they have presented the policy.
Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq has called for a full-court meeting to address a letter submitted by six judges, scheduled for today (Tuesday). This marks the first full-court meeting at the IHC in over a year.
Similarly, the Lahore High Court and Peshawar High Court convened full meetings on the same matter on Monday.
Senior lawyers express the belief that had the full-court meeting at the IHC been convened earlier, the current crisis could have been averted.

8,PM office bonuses raise IMF concerns,"Lender questions Rs24 billion grants, civil servants' honorariums","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has questioned Pakistan’s decision to grant financial rewards to all the officers of the Prime Minister’s office and approval of Rs24 billion in supplementary grants amid the economic crisis.
The government sources told The Express Tribune that the global lender raised questions in a correspondence with the Ministry of Finance.
The IMF inquired regarding the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approvals of Rs24 billion supplementary grants and award of honorariums for the PM’s Office. They said the nature of the IMF’s questions was more about the source of funding for these decisions.
IMF’s Resident Representative Esther Perez did not respond to a request for comments on the matter even after two weeks. She was asked to confirm the development and the IMF’s stance on the rewards to the PM’s office employees.
Despite the IMF’s intervention in the matter, it seems that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Muhammad
Aurangzeb was not in the mood to reverse the fiscally questionable decision. The Finance Ministry officials said it would be demeaning for the prime minister to reverse the decision on the IMF’s intervention.
But it will not be the first time that any prime minister would reverse his decisions on the IMF’s questioning. The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government had made changes in the June 2023 budget due to the IMF’s objections.
Former prime minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar could not secure the IMF’s nod for waiving off the electricity bills or at least recovering those in installments despite making public announcements.
A cabinet member claimed that the prime minister had not been properly briefed about the financial implication of the decision and no such decision would be made in the future.
The Express Tribune reported over two weeks ago that days before leaving for Washington to request the IMF for a new bailout package to avoid a default, Muhammad Aurangzeb approved four salaries in reward for officers working in the Prime Minister’s office.
The Prime Minister's Office’s employees are already getting higher than the standard pay packages.
The finance minister also approved two salaries in reward to the officials of the PM’s office - from grade 1 to -16 - taking their total reward to five salaries in just two months.
PM Shehbaz approved a fresh one-month salary in honorarium for his grade-17 to -21 officers and also restored three salaries in honorariums for the officers, which the former caretaker PM first approved and then withheld after The Express Tribune approached the PM office for a version.
The financial implication of the PM Shehbaz Sharif’s decision is over Rs51 million. The PM had cut the salaries of the federal cabinet ministers due to the prevailing grave economic situation.
The Fiscal Monitor report of the IMF indicated that the gap between expenditure and revenues may remain at 7.4% of the GDP for the fiscal year 2023-24 ending in June. This figure is nearly Rs1 trillion or 1% of the GDP higher than the deficit limit approved by the National Assembly.
Yet, the PM decided to open the public purse to appease the bureaucrats working in his office.
The sources said that the IMF also questioned the ECC’s decision to approve Rs24 billion in a supplementary budget to pay off liabilities of the government and clear the backlog developed due to the unrealistic annual allocations.
In its first meeting, the ECC approved Rs7 billion in additional subsidies for the people of Gilgit-Baltistan. The government had allocated a subsidy of Rs9.5 billion for the provision of 150,000 tons of wheat in the budget. However due to the increase in prices, the allocation was fully utilized by the end of March.
The ECC also approved Rs4.1 billion to pay off liabilities of the employees of SME Bank, which was being closed. The ECC approved Rs3.8 billion to cover a foreign loan for the Higher Education Commission.
It approved a grant of Rs1.7 billion for the Passport Office employees serving abroad. The government approved Rs300 million in a supplementary grant for Pakistan Rangers for the procurement of uniforms. It had approved Rs103 million for the Frontier Corps Balochistan to repair a VVIP helicopter.
Another Rs433 million was approved for the Pakistan Coast Guards to raise one more battalion for an anti-smuggling drive. To keep the matter secret, the Finance Ministry did not issue a press statement after the ECC meeting. But The Express Tribune had reported the ECC’s proceedings.
During the second review talks, the IMF had urged Pakistan to refrain from issuing even the technical supplementary grants aimed at achieving the primary budget surplus target of 0.4% of the GDP for this fiscal year.
Pakistan had missed the target for the first quarter of this fiscal year and the IMF gave a waiver to make the country eligible for the $706 million tranche. The World Bank stated earlier this month that the country is likely to miss this core IMF goal of achieving a primary surplus by the end of the fiscal year.
