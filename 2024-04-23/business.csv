0,IT exports surge to $306m in March,Expert says the export figure reflects the amount remitted from the services provided to international clients.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan recorded the highest-ever monthly IT exports of $306 million in March, posting a 37 per cent rise over the corresponding month last year.
The official data showed that the IT exports grew 19pc over the preceding month.
The previous highest monthly export number was $303m in December 2023, and the industry players have attributed this surge to conducive government policies.
Zohaib Khan, chairman P@SHA, the association of software houses and IT service providers, said the export figure reflects the amount remitted from the services provided to international clients.
“The IT exports is not a tangible item than can be measured in weight, length or number,” Mr Khan said and added that the exports have been on the rise, but due to some government policies, the software houses and technology companies have been parking payments received from the clients abroad. “We see a clear support for the IT sector by the government and mainly by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), more IT service exporters will bring their money back as the confidence level is increasing,” the chairman P@SHA added.

1,Shanghai Electric pulls offer to buy KE,Shanghai Electric has been in talks to acquire a stake in KE for more than half a decade.,"KARACHI: Shanghai Electric Power Company withdrew its offer to acquire up to 66.4 per cent of K-Electric Ltd, the manager of the offer said in a notice to the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Monday.
The deadline for making a firm offer for the K-Electric stake expired on April 20 and Shanghai Electric has withdrawn its bid, Arif Habib Ltd, the manager said in the notice to the bourse.
KE is the only electricity generator, transmitter, and distributor for Karachi, the country’s largest city, and its adjoining areas, and the only listed electricity supplier. It was privatised in 2005.
Shanghai Electric has been in talks to acquire a stake in KE for more than half a decade.
The deal has been repeatedly delayed due to regulatory approvals and liquidity constraints as a consequence of mounting circular debt in the country’s power sector. The government of Pakistan owns a 24.4pc stake in KE.
In June last year, Shanghai Electric reiterated its commitment to the deal, which was worth approximately $1.77 billion in 2016 but had the likelihood of changing.

3,Refineries oppose Ogra’s pricing deregulation model,"Say shutting down units due to storage constraints, low sales and smuggling surge.","ISLAMABAD: Strongly opposing the petroleum pricing deregulation model suggested by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), the oil refineries have started shutting down their refining units due to storage constraints caused by declining sales of domestic products and the rising influx of smuggled products throughout the country.
“Why would oil marketing companies (OMCs) lift oil product from refineries, involving a substantial impact of taxes, when they can access cheaper product in the black market?” questioned an official representing the refining sector. He added that Ogra had proposed doing away with requirement of uplifting domestic products from refineries, giving companies the freedom to source their products at their own will on commercial basis.
The current situation is an eye-opener even before the pricing deregulation is allowed, he said, adding that availability of smuggled products, once limited to border areas, has now expanded across the country, forcing refineries to drastically cut down their production.
“Attock Refinery has been forced to shut down its main distillation unit (of 32,000 barrels per day), reducing its capacity to only 33pc on Monday,” the official said.

Say shutting down units due to storage constraints, low sales and smuggling surge

“The ongoing rampant smuggling and now proposals of oil pricing deregulation without consultation of all stake stakeholders may jeopardise refineries’ upgradation plans, which were expected to bring in $5-6 billion investment following the recent approval of Refineries Upgradation Policy,” warned all five refineries in the country.
In a letter, the refineries expressed “deep concern” over Ogra’s recommendation to disband the first upliftment priority principle of local product for providing “level playing field to OMCs for negotiating ex-refinery price”. They also protested Ogra’s recommendation that “OMCs should be given the choice to efficiently source their supplies locally or from the international market in complete negation of the laid down principle” as required under Rule 35(g) of Pakistan Oil (Refining, Blending, Transportation, Storage and Marketing) Rules 2016 (OGRA Rules).
The protest letter stated that the refineries were strategic assets of the country, and their sustainability and continuity were essential for the prosperity and economic development of Pakistan. 
“Local refineries are the backbone of industrial development and are intrinsically connected to the defense and energy security needs of the country. Any blind reliance on completely imported fuels will not only increase the risk to the country’s energy supply chain but also has the potential to result in disastrous consequences,” noted the letter, jointly written by chief executives of Attock, Cynergico, National, Pak-Arab, and Pakistan Refineries.
The refineries’ $5-6bn upgradation plan would not only result in cleaner, environment-friendly fuels of Euro-V specifications but would also lead to savings of precious foreign exchange by substantially increasing local production of diesel and petrol. 
“Hence, it would be most unfortunate if the planned upgradation projects are abandoned by the refineries due to these irrational recommendations,” the refineries said, adding that the deregulation of the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) would also impact the adjustment of customs duty paid by the refineries on the import of crude oil, subsequently placing importing refineries at a huge disadvantage.
They said the refining sector was already struggling to operate at optimum levels due to the menace of smuggled inferior products in the country and would further get a major set-back from Ogra proposed model. 
They said the deregulation of petroleum products was a complex and critical issue and local refineries being major stakeholders must be involved and consulted before moving forward. The sector required pragmatic and supporting measures rather than suggesting ways that if implemented would result in permanent closure of refineries.

4,"PSX crosses 71,000-level","KARACHI: On the back of multiple positive economic numbers, the stock market maintained its overnight bull run,...","KARACHI: On the back of multiple positive economic numbers, the stock market maintained its overnight bull run, tossing the KSE-100 index to its highest-ever level by closing above the 71,000-point level on Monday.
Listing the significant developments fuelling the bullish market sentiments, Topline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Muha­mmad Suhail said the country posted a record single-month current account surplus of $619 million in almost nine years, foreign direct investment surged to a 20-month high of $258m and the IT exports peaked at an all-time high of $306m in March.
According to Topline Securities, the following sectors, such as oil and gas exploration, banks, fertilisers, and cement, drove the index’s upward movement. Companies like Mari Petroleum Ltd, United Bank Ltd, Engro Fertilisers Ltd, Lucky Cement and Oil and Gas Development Company collectively contributed 351 points to the index performance. 
However, Hub Power, Bank Al-Habib and EPCL collected wiped out 57 points. Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation attributed the rally to robust corporate earnings season and rising expectations of a cut in the State Bank of Pakistan’s policy rate in its upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting on April 29 following a sharp deceleration in the headline inflation to 20.7pc in March.
He added that the deliberations on privatisation of state-owned enterprises, rupee stability amid foreign inflows and progress on the new Extended Fund Facility as an IMF team will be visiting next month to proceed further on Pakistan’s loan request also contributed to the market’s highest closing ever.
However, the index moved both ways, dipping to the day’s low at 70,882.45, losing 27.46 points, and a high of 71,861.18, gaining 951.28 points. As a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index closed at 71,433.46 points after adding 523.56 points, or 0.74pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume surged 37.69pc to 655.20 million shares. The traded value also rose 34.57pc to Rs31.24bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Habib Bank Ltd (48.14m shares), Pak Refinery Ltd (30.50m shar­es), Pak Elektron Ltd (28.59m shares), Worldcall Tele­com Ltd (24.62m sha­res) and K-Electric (23.58m shares).

5,IMF board to approve $1.1bn on 29th,"“The review meeting is set for 10am on April 29,” diplomatic source says.","WASHINGTON: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will meet on April 29 to finalise its last review of Pakistan’s $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).
“According to the IMF’s event calendar, the review meeting is set for 10:00am on April 29,” a diplomatic source informed Dawn.
Earlier this week, the Fund published a schedule of the Executive Board’s meetings on its website, which indicated Nigeria as the country whose programme would be reviewed on April 29. The subsequent meeting on May 1 will review IMF programmes with Kiribati and Montenegro, with Pakistan notably absent from the list.
Previous statements from both the IMF and Pakistani officials indicated that not only would the board convene on April 29, but it would also approve the release of the final tranche of $1.1 billion under the SBA signed in June 2023.
The absence of this meeting from the IMF’s public calendar has sparked speculation in Pakistan, suggesting that the country may have been excluded from the board’s agenda. Some have even speculated that Pakistan might need to renegotiate the release of the final tranche.
“These are baseless speculations,” said a former World Bank official. “The IMF doesn’t operate in this manner. If there’s a decision to delay a programme, it would be done openly, not clandestinely.”
He explained that while a meeting might be delayed due to scheduling complications, this typically has no impact on a programme after a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA).
In March, IMF staff and Pakistani authorities reached an SLA for the second and final review, which was subsequently forwarded to the board for final approval. Upon approval, Pakistan would have access to SDR 828 million (approximately $1.1bn).
Meanwhile, in an interview with the US news magazine, The National, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that Pakistan is on track to secure a new loan from the IMF, adding that the money lender had been “very receptive in terms of agreeing to consider a larger, longer programme”.
In the interview published on Monday, Aurangzeb said that macroeconomic indicators were shifting in Pakistan’s favour. “He also sounded optimistic that Pakistan’s currency has finally stabilised and said rampant inflation is on track to drop to single-digit levels by the end of next year,” The National said.
The National noted that Pakistan was seeking a $6bn IMF loan, but Aurangzeb said the figure was more of a “guesstimate.” The loan’s final details will be determined when an IMF mission visits Islamabad next month.
In the interview, the finance minister also talked about China and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), stating that Pakistan had “missed a trick” by taking too long to monetise projects, including through boosting exports to special economic zones.
“We have been slow over the last few years,” he said. “We are going to move forward with phase two so that we can get going with the revenue-generating part of the CPEC,” he said.
He also underscored the importance of remittances to Pakistan’s economy. He said that payments from overseas were on the rise and were expected to rise to about $29bn this fiscal year.
Meeting with UAE investors
The state-run news agency APP reported on Monday that Mr Aurangzeb held meetings in Dubai with leading UAE investors, including Ayana Holding Chairman Abdulla Bin Lahej and Nad Al Shiba Holding chief Mohammed Hilal Bin Tarraf Al Mansoori.
The minister explored ways to enhance investment activity between the UAE and Pakistan by supporting existing economic partnerships and exploring further diversification in information technology, renewable energy, transport and logistics, infrastructure and real estate development, according to a press statement issued by the finance ministry.
He highlighted the competitive advantages that make Pakistan an ideal destination for investors seeking high returns and sustainable growth.
The minister also highlighted the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council in assisting investors at every stage of their journey, comprehensive support services including market research, regulatory guidance, investment facilitation, and post-investment support, ensuring a smooth experience.

6,Current account posts highest surplus in 9 years,The latest data issued by the State Bank shows the current account at $619 million in surplus.,"KARACHI: The current account posted a nine-year-high surplus in March, making it possible for the country to bring down the overall deficit to below $1 billion during the July-March period of FY24.
The March surplus was much higher than February’s   $98m. 
The latest data issued by the State Bank on Monday shows the current account was $619 million in surplus last month — a rise of 15.3 per cent over $537m recorded in March 2023. The account had posted a surplus of $801m in Feb 2015. 
The data further reveals that the current account deficit had come down to $805m at the end of the third quarter (nine months) of FY24. The deficit stood at $4.313bn in March last year. 
The country has been trying hard to bring down the current account deficit as it eats up most of the export earnings and compels the country to borrow from external sources for meeting the twin deficits: in trade and current account. 
The country was on the brink of sovereign default by the end of June 2023, but a timely support of $3bn Stand-by Arrangement from the IMF helped it avoid a default. 
Remittances
After the IMF assistance, the government took serious steps to slash imports to reduce the trade deficit and was ultimately able to bring down the current account deficit. This drastic step to slow down demand proved injurious for the economy, resulting in negative GDP growth in FY23 and with the nation struggling to achieve a two per cent growth.
According to analysts, the March surplus was mainly due to higher exports in the IT sector and a jump in remittances due to Ramazan.
Pakistan received about $3bn in remittances last month — a 0.9 per cent rise during July-March FY24. The same period of the last fiscal saw a decline of 9.4 per cent.
The Jan-March period was the first quarter of FY24 that posted a current account surplus of $324m. The July-Sept FY24 period recorded a deficit of $1.118bn while the Oct-Dec quarter witnessed a deficit of only $11m.
Analysts believe that the fiscal year FY24 may witness a zero current account deficit and this would strengthen the government’s hand in negotiations with the IMF. 
With the government considering launching Eurobonds in the international market, the zero CA may create space for it. 
The finance minister had said recently that the government wanted to launch $300m Panda bonds in the Chinese market. A zero current account deficit would help the government tap the Chinese market.

7,Cotton crop outlook bleak for Punjab,Growers will face a new challenge of around 30pc irrigation water shortages for kharif crops.,"LAHORE: The outlook for the upcoming cotton crop season appears bleak due to unfavourable weather conditions, insufficient irrigation water, and the government’s tepid response to resolve the growers’ issues.
Sindh benefited from early cotton sowing last season (2023-24) as the crop matured before the heat stress of May and June; the first picking had also been done in many areas. The province tried to repeat the experience this year, too, but heavy rains spoiled the sown lands, and in many cotton areas, the crop is being re-cultivated.
Observing over 100 per cent higher production in Sindh due to early sowing last year, the Punjab agriculture authorities decided to adopt a similar strategy this season. They claimed over one million acres had been brought under early cotton cultivation. However, they have reduced the overall lint acreage from 5.2m acres last year to 4m this year.
Growers will face a new challenge of around 30pc irrigation water shortages for kharif crops. Furthermore, the Federal Committee on Agriculture has yet to convene to set acreage and production targets for the kharif crops, a meeting usually held in the first fortnight of March.
“Surprisingly, the federal government has not yet set any national production and cultivation targets for cotton after many decades. Nor has it announced the intervention price of the crop,” remarks Cotton Ginners Forum chairman Ihsanul Haq.
He says Sindh has urged federal authorities to set the intervention price at Rs10,000 per maund, although growers could not secure Rs8,500 per maund rate last season.
Sindh Abadgar Board president Mahmood Nawaz Shah argues that growers abandon cotton not solely due to water shortage, as some suggest, but because the crop is no longer profitable.
He contends that if water shortages were the primary reason, the farming community would not have switched to water-intensive sugarcane and rice crops.
Meanwhile, the local cotton market experienced a downturn with reduced volume and declining prices following the extended Eidul Fitr holidays.
Karachi Cotton Brokers Association chairman Naseem Usman attributes the downturn to decreases in international rates, prompting the local textile industry to turn to lint imports.

8,Foreign direct investment jumps 51pc,"However, FDI inflows from China and the UAE dropped during the period.","KARACHI: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) jumped by 51.7 per cent to $258 million in March compared to $170m in the same month last year.
Higher FDI inflows amid prevailing economic and political uncertainties, particularly after the general elections, would help the new government improve the country’s image abroad through economic reforms.
However, the State Bank of Pakistan data released on Monday showed that the FDI inflows in the first nine months of the current fiscal year fell compared to the same period in the preceding fiscal year.
During July-March FY24, the country received $1.099bn against an inflow of $1.217bn in the same period of last year, showing a fall of 9.7pc or a loss of $118m. Pakistan has the lowest FDI preference in the region and receives close to $2bn in FDI per annum.
The FDI inflows from at least two countries were disappointing during this period. China has been the biggest investor in Pakistan but the scenario has changed. The inflow from China was $262m in 9MFY24 compared to $556.6m in the same period last year.
Inflows from the UAE dropped drastically. The nine-month inflow from UAE was $27.7m compared to $88.7m in the same period last fiscal year. The government expects to attract billions of dollars from the UAE under the SIFC.
The nine-month inflows from Hong Kong were $264m, from the UK $196.3m, from the USA $100.7m, and from Japan $5.2m against $140m in the same period last year.
