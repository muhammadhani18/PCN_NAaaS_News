0,KP govt to move SC against high court’s orders over swearing-in of MPAs,Gandapur claims ‘distribution’ of reserved assembly seats to other parties unlawful,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on Monday said his government had decided to move the Supreme Court against the orders of the Peshawar High Court for the swearing-in of the provincial assembly’s members elected to seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.
Mr Gandapur told a news conference at the Chief Minister’s House here that the nominees of the Sunni Ittehad Council won Sunday’s by-elections for both national and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, and therefore, the SIC had the right to the reserved assembly seats.
He said the “distribution” of the KP Assembly’s seats reserved for women and non-Muslims to other political parties was unconstitutional and unlawful.
On March 3, the Election Commission of Pakistan rejected the SIC’s plea for the allocation of reserved seats to its nominees, insisting that Article 51 of the Constitution declares that only the political parties having representation in the National Assembly by way of winning seats would be eligible for the allocation of reserved seats for women and non-Muslims through the proportional representation system.

Gandapur claims ‘distribution’ of reserved assembly seats to other parties unlawful

Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017, says: “For the purpose of election to seats reserved for women and non-Muslims in an assembly, the political parties contesting election for such seats shall, within the period fixed by the Commission for submission of nomination papers, file separate lists of their candidates in order of priority for seats reserved for women and non-Muslims with the Commission or, as it may direct, with the provincial election commissioner or other authorised officer of the Commission, who shall forthwith cause such lists to be published for information of the public.”
It read that the commission was of the view that under provisions of Article 51(6) of the Constitution read with Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 […] the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats for having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of the party’s list for reserved seats, which was the requirement of the law.
The chief minister raised questions about “high” voter turnout in Sunday’s by-elections and said it never happened in the country’s history that more than 50 per cent of the total votes were polled in a by-election.
He said surprisingly, more votes were polled in some areas of Punjab in the by-elections compared to the recent general elections.
Mr Gandapur claimed offices of the SIC’s election nominees were destroyed in the Sindh province.
He said the provincial government had received a letter from the federal government for talks about power theft and line losses, but even before those parleys could begin, a crackdown was launched in the province.
The chief minister said he told the provincial police chief not to file cases of electricity theft until talks were held.
He urged the centre to claim its dues from Rs1.51 trillion it had to pay to KP under different heads.
Mr Gandapur said he would hold political meetings in other provinces as well to raise the voice for KP’s rights.
He said PTI founder Imran Khan was put behind bars over illegal cases.
“It is better for the federal government to change its behaviour towards opposition parties,” he said.
The chief minister said keeping in view the entire regional situation, talks should be held with everyone for peace.
“This is not the domain of the provincial government, but [former prime minister] Imran Khan has always said we shouldn’t be part of someone else’s war. He believes in resolution of issues through dialogue,” he said.
Mr Gandapur said law-enforcement agencies in KP, especially police, were targetted by militants in Dera Ismail Khan, Mardan, and Swabi.
He said had the police not checked the advances of militants in KP, the latter would have reached Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi.

2,Kohistan police beef up security for Chinese convoys,DPO warns strict action would be taken in case of negligence on part of police personnel in the provision of foolproof security to Chinese workers.,"MANSEHRA: The Lower Kohistan police have beefed up security for Chinese convoys in the region to prevent terrorist attacks, said district police officer Dr Mohammad Umar on Monday.
“Besides fighting terrorism, we [the police] are also ensuring the safety of Chinese nationals associated with mega energy projects on our soil, especially on the Karakoram Highway,” the DPO told a function at the police lines.
He said stricter security measures were introduced for Chinese nationals to prevent terrorist attacks like the one that targetted a convey of Chinese engineers in Bisham lately.
Dr Umar was made the DPO last week following the suspension of his predecessor, Jamil Akhtar, by provincial police chief Akhtar Hayat Gandapur over the lapse of security in the March 26 Bisham suicide attack that killed five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver.
The DPO laid a wreath at the memorial to the martyred policemen and inspected the guard of honour by a police contingent on arrival at the police lines.
He said the police department had increased the number of personnel deployed on the Chakai checkpost and others on the KKH up to the Upper Kohistan district.
“No vehicle will be allowed to move ahead without thorough checking,” he said.
The district police officer warned that strict action would be taken in case of negligence on part of police personnel in the provision of foolproof security to Chinese workers on the Karakoram Highway.
“We prefer the lives of Chinese workers to ours in line with our traditions and will go to any extent to protect them,” he said.
SP (investigations) Tahirur Rehman, SDPO of Pattan Circle Raja Khan, SDPO of Bankhad Ranowalia Circle Aurangzeb Khan and SHOs of police stations from across the district attended the meeting.
MOTORCYCLES SEIZED: The traffic police have seized over 100 motorcycles for being driven by underage bikers in Mansehra city and its suburbs.
The action comes on the orders of the district police officer, according to chief of traffic police Wajid Khan.
He told reporters here on Monday that the police called the parents of those underage bikers to promise in writing that their children wouldn’t drive motorcycles again without licences.
Mr Khan said those undertakings would ensure the return of seized motorcycles to their owners.
He said underage bikers put their as well as others’ lives at risk in road accidents.

7,Closure of three post offices in Chitral flayed,"CHITRAL: The people of Chitral have decried the closure of three post offices here, which catered to the needs of...","CHITRAL: The people of Chitral have decried the closure of three post offices here, which catered to the needs of over 55,000 people of eight village councils.
Pakistan Post has reportedly closed down three of its 13 post offices in Chitral, insisting that these branches were not running on profit. The closed down branches include Drassun in Upper Chitral, which was established as early as in 1964, and Koghuzi and Ashrait in Lower Chitral.
The residents of the three villages have demanded of the prime minister to take notice of the closure of post offices, which they said played a pivotal role in their lives. They said the postmaster general of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should be asked as to why he had taken such a ‘punitive’ decision.
During a protest meeting held in Drassun area on Monday, the speakers, including village chairman Abdur Rafi and elders Hamid Jalal, Mubarak Shah and others said closure of the facility would create multiple issues for the residents as Pakistan Post was the only available agency here to send and receive letters and other consignments.
They said that thousands of students registered with different universities under the distant learning system would have to discontinue their studies. They said call letters from various public and private sector organisations were always delivered by the Pakistan Post.
The residents said that the British rulers had established a post office in Mastuj town of Upper Chitral in 1896 after annexing Chitral an year earlier due to the significance of the facility and in doing so, they did not consider its profitability as it linked the people with the government.
They alleged that the high-ups of Pakistan Post had taken the arbitrary step of closing down the post offices to conceal their wrongdoings in the recruitment process last year when people from Dir, Swat and Buner districts were appointed to the posts of mail runner and postman.
The residents said the post offices were being closed down in Chitral so the non-local employees could be posted to their home districts.

SSP Operations, retired flight lieutenant Hafiz Kamran Asghar told newsmen that police had arrested four suspects involved in the kidnapping for ransom and murder as all of them belonged to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and recovered weapons and vehicle used by the kidnappers.
During investigation, the suspects revealed that the deceased Rehmatullah died immediately after the kidnapping and the body was buried. On the pointation of the accused Sadiq, a laborer, the body was recovered from Tarnol and shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital for postmortem. The relatives of the deceased identified the body, police said.
The SSP Operations said that the deceased left his house to visit his friend, one ofd the suspects, on the morning of second day of Eidul Fitr but did not return.
He said that preliminary investigation revealed that Rehmatullah died the same day. However, the real cause of his death was yet to be established because the suspects had been claiming that he died of cardiac arrest and was buried in a graveyard near Tarnol. Later, the kidnappers went to Chiniot and made a phone call to the family of Rehmatullah and demanded Rs10 million ransom.
“Since the kidnappers knew that Rehmatullah had enough money, they detained him and later demanded Rs10 million from his family,” SSP Kamran said.
He said the arrest of the main accused Sadiq came about after the police took the CCTV footage from an ATM booth which led to his arrest. Otherwise, the police teams had been searching for the kidnappers in Chiniot in the wake of a threat call they had made from there to mislead the police.
Initially, he said, Sadiq was detained who revealed that Waheed Gul, Abdullah and Mohammad Bahadur were also accompanying him. Later, they were arrested by the police, he said.
Yes, the DNA test on the body will also be conducted, the accused were friends of the deceased and one of the accused was the owner of the room, the deceased had been using.
Mohammad Shafiq, a resident of Dhoke Syedan Kamalabad, brother-in-law of the victim lodged an FIR with the R.A. Bazaar police two days after his brother-in-law Rehmatullah went missing.
He said in the FIR that Rehmatullah left his house on Friday at 11:30am saying that he was going to visit his friends and he would be back in the evening. But he did not return and neither had he responded to calls made on his mobile phone repeatedly.

9,Visa curbs cut Afghan arrivals in Peshawar hospitals,Medics insist mostly cancer patients affected by restrictions,"PESHAWAR: The recent visa restrictions by Pakistani authorities have “drastically” reduced the number of visitors from Afghanistan to Peshawar’s hospitals, claim doctors.
The move to allow entry to only Afghan nationals with valid passports and Pakistani visas came last week in light of the “delicate” law and order situation, according to officials.
They said the curbs had formally been communicated to Kabul for compliance by Afghans seeking to enter Pakistan for one reason or another, but even then, most Afghan patients wanted to cross the Torkham border without valid travel documents.
Doctors of Peshawar’s hospitals told Dawn that the imposition of new visa curbs had caused “health complications” for Afghans seeking cancer treatment or tertiary care services in Peshawar’s hospitals.

Medics insist mostly cancer patients affected by restrictions

They said though in fewer numbers, Afghan patients continued to come over for diagnosis and treatment as their country didn’t have those health services.
The doctors said visa restrictions had badly hit Afghans wanting follow-up checkups and treatment at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCH&RC) in Peshawar or surgeries in private hospitals.
They said after the introduction of visa curbs, only 10–12 emergency cases were allowed to enter Pakistan on a daily basis, unlike in the past, when the number was around 120.
The doctors added that 75 per cent of those patients suffered from cancer.
Medical practitioners in the provincial capital’s private hospitals told Dawn that patients requiring follow-up examinations and treatment developed health complications due to delayed visitors to the hospitals.
“Afghanistan doesn’t have a good healthcare system. The war that lasted decades not only destroyed its big hospitals but also forced medics to go abroad for employment. Now, the [Afghan] people are banking on Pakistani hospitals for specialised healthcare,” a doctor told Dawn.
He said the majority of Afghans visited the SKMCH&RC for chemotherapy and other services that weren’t available in their own country.
Visa curbs have badly hit private hospitals as well, many of which have established special desks to cater for Afghans coming over with Persian-speaking attendants, according to doctors.
“This is bad for both Afghan patients and hospitals. Authorities should allow patients entry to Pakistan after checking hospital documents,” a senior surgeon at a private medical centre told Dawn.
He said lower patient arrivals had financial implications for the hospitals.
The surgeon said while strengthening security checks, the government should allow the Afghans badly in need of treatment.
Another private hospital’s administrator told Dawn that visa restrictions for Afghan nationals were a loss to the national economy.
“Not only are new curbs massive suffering for Afghan patients, but they’re a lost opportunity for our economy,” he said.
The administrator said children suffering from minor health issues developed complications due to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
He said Afghan nationals used to cross the border for medical examination and treatment in hospitals without hindrance, but the imposition of visa restrictions had caused serious issues for them.
The doctors said Afghan patients were screened in Jalalabad before departure for the border crossing, where they were checked by medics of the Pak-Afghan Dosti Hospital.
They said those patients were examined by X-ray and ECG machines and underwent lab testing and security checking before being sent to Pakistani hospitals.
The doctors said Peshawar hospitals received Afghans with heart, liver, kidney, stroke, orthopedics, diabetes, and eye, psychological, gynecological, and acute emergency issues.
