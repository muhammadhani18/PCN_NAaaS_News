The party accuses Ms Ihsan of impersonating the candidate actually fielded by them on a reserved seat for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The case was taken up by a three-judge SC bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan. The JUI-F had moved the apex court against the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) April 2 order which had led the ECP to reinstate Ms Ihsan as a member of the National Assembly.
While issuing notices, the apex court observed that it cannot settle the matter without hearing the commission as well as the AGP and postponed the proceedings for two weeks.

JUI-F claims Sadaf Ihsan ‘impersonated’ its candidate to become MNA

Representing JUI-F, senior counsel Kamran Murtaza explained that the party had submitted with the ECP separate lists of its candidates in order of priority for seats reserved for women and non-Muslims, adding the party would withdraw its stance if Ms Ihsan presents before the court the ticket that the party had issued to her.
Earlier, the ECP had withdrawn the victory notification after the JUI-F disowned Ms Ihsan being a member of the party.
In its petition, JUI-F pleaded that a list was furnished to the ECP containing details for three candidates, including Hina Bibi (Respondent 6). However, to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin — the candidate who Sadaf Ihsan impersonated — only her name was added to the list because other details had not been conveyed by her to the party.
According to the petition, prior to the issuance of the notification of the returned candidate, the ECP ought to have either rejected the list to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin or sought clarification from the party whether Sadaf Ihsan was Sadaf Yasmin or not.
The JUI-F emphasised that it was purely the prerogative of political parties to decide the candidature for the reserved seats of women in order of priority under Article 51(e) of the Constitution, Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 and Chapter VI of Elections Rules 2017.
The ECP can recall or amend a notification issued under Article 51 of the Constitution, read with Section 104 of Elections Act 2017 for reserved NA seats for women, if an impersonator has managed to get a reserved seat due to negligence of the Returning Officer, the petition said.
A political party and the rightful candidate cannot be deprived of a seat due to negligence on part of an ECP official, the petition bemoaned, adding that the claim of Ms Ihsan on the seat was a privilege granted by the party.
Thus Ms Ihsan cannot claim rights on a seat before the PHC by going against the stance of her own party about her being an impersonator and her having no right to enforce for a reserved seat not meant for her, the petition emphasised.

1,Balochistan govt to introduce air ambulance,"QUETTA: Balochistan, which lags behind other provinces in terms of development, is going to have an air ambulance...","QUETTA: Balochistan, which lags behind other provinces in terms of development, is going to have an air ambulance service soon, according to health department officials.
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has decided to start ‘Peoples Air Ambulance Service’ as soon as possible to facilitate critically patients in need of immediate transfer to hospitals, health officials told Dawn on Monday. 
“With the launch of air ambulance, patients can be transferred to major hospitals across the country, including Quetta, on an emergency basis,” the officials quoted Mr Bugti as saying during a meeting at CM House. 
According to sources, it has been decided that instead of purchasing a new air-ambulance, which will cost the exchequer a fortune, one of the two aircraft of the provincial government will be converted into the air-ambulance equipped with all the latest facilities. 
“Earlier, the government wanted to sell out the old aircraft and offers were invited through advertisements published in newspapers,” a senior government official told Dawn. 
During the previous government headed by Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, the aircraft used by the governor and chief minister had been utilised many times for shifting of seriously ill patients from far-flung areas to Quetta and Karachi for treatment.  
The plane was also used for air-dropping food and relief goods in the flood-hit areas of Balochistan in 2022. 
CM Bugti said that efforts would be made to improve service delivery in all sectors, including health, adding that substantial results can be achieved by changing the decision-making priorities. 
He said the provincial government had been working hard to provide quality medical facilities to the poor by bringing extraordinary reforms in the health sector.

4,"PM asks people to reduce plastic waste, embrace  eco-friendly alternatives","Shehbaz emphasises role of provincial govts, people in safeguarding planet","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif on Monday urged the people to reaffirm their commitment to using plastic responsibly to reduce plastic waste and embrace recycled and eco-friendly alternatives.
The prime minister said this in a message on the occasion of the International Earth Day which was observed on Monday. The theme of this year’s Earth Day was “Planet vs Plastics”. 
“As we unite to observe this day under the theme, “Planet vs Plastics” that calls for a 60 per cent reduction in plastic use by 2040, let us reaffirm our commitment to use plastic responsibly to reduce plastic waste that is not only polluting our oceans, lakes, and rivers but are also making inroads into our food systems, posing a direct and serious threat to human health,” the PM’s message said. 
The prime minister appealed to the people to reduce the use of single-use plastics and embrace recycled and eco-friendly alternatives, and advocate for stronger environmental policies at every level of society.

Shehbaz emphasises role of provincial govts, people in safeguarding planet

Several past governments tried to impose a complete ban on use of plastic shopping bags but failed to implement it.
Calling the International Earth Day a reminder of shared responsibility towards protecting our planet for now and for future generations, the prime minister said that though Pakistan was among one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, there was little awareness about the risks of climate change threatening the development, well-being and economic security of the masses.
“Year after year, we are witnessing its devastating impacts — from changing seasonal weather patterns, rising temperatures, variability of monsoons and melting of glaciers in the north, further compounded with recurrent extreme weather events and natural disasters — to the slower onset events of sea level rise, warming seas and loss of ecosystems,” the prime minister said.
He said that effects of climate change had exacerbated over the years, which puts the country at an even greater economic and physical risk. 
“Hence, we understand the urgency of taking bold and decisive steps to confront these challenges and build resilience in the face of adversity,” he said.
The government, he said, was leading the charge and remained committed to making its contribution as it had initiated an exhaustive consultative process with ministries concerned, provincial environment departments, Islamabad Capital Territory  administration, industries and other relevant stakeholders for developing Single-Use Plastics (Prohibition) Regulations, 2023, as well as restriction on the use of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles in federal ministries/divisions.
“These initiatives underscore our commitment towards promoting a sustainable circular economy for plastics by reducing waste, and consumption, and encouraging reuse, recycling, and material recovery.”
“To achieve a plastic-free society and effectively combat the escalating issue of plastic pollution in Pakistan, it is imperative to address the underlying causes and promote a holistic approach for managing plastic waste,” the prime minister said.
Mr Sharif said the role of provincial governments and local authorities was of prime importance and urged the people to play their role in safeguarding the planet for the prosperity of all.
Recounting the nature’s bounties for the country in the form of awe-inspiring mountains, dense forests and pristine lakes and coasts, the prime minister emphasised the society’s responsibility to protect them.
Later, the visiting Iranian President Dr Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi and PM Sharif jointly planted a sapling in the lawn of the Prime Minister’s House to mark the annual Earth Day.
Accompanied by his spouse and a high-powered delegation of ministers and businessmen, the Iranian president arrived here on a three-day official visit on Monday.
Both the dignitaries planted the sapling of Chir pine, also known as Pinus roxburghii, native to the Himalayas.

6,Katcha dacoits of Sindh won’t find refuge in Nasirabad: DIG,Says over 100 criminals wanted for murder held in two months.,"DERA MURAD JA­­MALI: The Nasirabad Range DIG, Malik Saleem Lehri, said on Monday the dacoits from Sindh’s katcha areas will not be allowed to take refuge in any of the bordering districts in Balochistan.
Speaking at a press conference along with Nasirabad SSP Samiullah Malik, DIG Lehri said that the divisional police and administration have taken strict security measures on the routes to stop the crossing of dacoits into Balochistan.
The police have been put on high alert at check posts in border areas of Nasirabad region to ensure dacoits from Sindh did not take refuge in any area of Nasirabad region, DIG Lehri said while replying to a question.
He said Nasirabad police were taking comprehensive action against criminal gangs who slipped into Balochistan from Sindh in the past.

Says over 100 criminals wanted for murder held in two months

The statement came at a time when security forces, including police and Rangers, were conducting a large-scale operation against bandits in Sindh’s katcha areas.
He said 118 criminals and absconders involved in heinous crimes, including murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping for ransom and highway robberies have been arrested.
DIG Lehri also claimed that in crackdowns against drug smugglers in the last two months, the police have recovered huge quantities of drugs worth millions of rupees and made at least a dozen arrests, including drug peddlers involved in running drug peddlers.
Illegal arms were also seized, along with stolen motorcycles and other vehicles.
The police also managed to recover a girl who was kidnapped from Punjab and brought to Nasirabad, the DIG said, adding that she was later handed over to the family.
He said all possible steps were being taken to maintain law and order in the area.
The operation against dacoits in riverine areas of Sindh and Punjab was launched after a steep rise in kidnapping for ransom and robberies in these areas.
Last week, the Na­­ti­o­nal Action Plan Imple­m­e­ntation Review Com­mit­tee decided to launch a joint operation by Sindh and Punjab police against the notorious bandits.

7,Nawaz Sharif heads to China for low-key visit,"Media reports suggest visit is of ""personal nature"" to undergo a “medical check-up”.","LAHORE: PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif on Monday left for China on a ‘low-profile’ five-day visit, with the ruling party refusing to divulge details about the nature of his trip.
PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurang­zeb and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar did not confirm the elder Sharif’s “unannounced visit” to Beijing.
“I have no idea (about Nawaz Sharif’s China visit),” Mr Tarar told Dawn. However, a PML-N minister confirmed to Dawn that the elder Sharif had indeed left for China on a “private visit”.
Media reports suggested the visit was of a ‘personal nature’, during which he will undergo a “medical check-up” and hold meetings with some Chinese companies regarding development works in Punjab, where his daughter Maryam Nawaz is the chief minister. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Maryam’s son Junaid Safdar are accompanying him.

CM Maryam directs Punjab govt to provide solar power systems to 50,000 households

A source close to the Sharif family told Dawn that the purpose of the elder Sharif’s visit was not discussed with the party leadership. “The programme of [Nawaz] Sharif’s visit to China has been kept secret from the party and the PML-N government. Perhaps some very close associates of the elder Sharif would know the exact nature of his visit,” he said.
The insider said it was being speculated in party circles whether the elder Sharif had some ‘special assignment’ in China, which could not be carried out by his younger brother, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Nawaz Sharif has never visited China in the past for medical reasons, preferring to travel instead to London, where he has undergone multiple procedures. Most recently, he remained there from 2019 to 2023.
Solar power
The Punjab government will provide 1kV solar power system each to 50,000 households in the province.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz presided over a meeting on ‘Light without Electricity Bill, Roshan Punjab Programme’ for a briefing on technical issues of 1kV solar power for domestic consumers, here on Monday.
The Roshan Punjab Programme of the provincial government aims to provide free electricity to the poor.
Approving the grant of 1kV solar power system to 50,000 households in Punjab, the chief minister directed to start the pilot project immediately. “Pro­­­tected consumers consuming up to 100 units of electricity will be eligible under the programme in the first phase. In a 1kV system, two solar panels, battery, inverter, and wires will be provided to consumers.”
Up to 16 hours of charging backup can be achieved through the lithium iron battery.
The chief minister directed the officials concerned to install the solar system of the latest technology.
Women police station
The chief minister on Monday inaugurated the first virtual women police station at the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA).
“The Virtual Women Police Station will guide women through all stages of the crime, from registration of the FIR to its investigation and trial.
’’Women can contact police through 15 Call, Women Safety App live chat feature, video call feature, Punjab Police App and Safe City web portal,“ she said.

8,PTI alleges role of intelligence agencies in election rigging,Announces plans to protest poll manipulation from Friday; demands sedition cases against Punjab govt bosses.,"ISLAMABAD: Just a day after by-elections were held across the country, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders alleged that intelligence and security agencies had played a role in rigging the polls.
Saying that April 21 will be remembered as a “black day” in the history of Pakistan, the party urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to withhold the notifications of results and announced a series of protests, starting from Friday.
“[The] day of election is considered an accountability day, and people cast their votes with great zeal. However, on April 21, open and blatant violations of law were observed. The magnitude of the rigging and violation of law has never been observed in the history of Pakistan. Gates of polling stations were closed, and at some polling stations, more votes were polled than the total registered votes,” PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan told a press conference.
Accompanied by Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan, and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the PTI chairman said that at one polling station in Gujrat, election staff informed him that 120 votes were cast, yet three boxes full of ballot papers were seen.

Announces plans to protest poll manipulation from Friday; demands sedition cases against Punjab govt bosses

“At one polling station, the candidate’s father informed us that votes were already cast even though polling time had not yet begun. We have reported all complaints to the ECP, but the election watchdog took no action. We demand that the ECP conduct an inquiry and also share that how it will ensure that such rigging will not be repeated next time,” he said.
He also questioned why the ECP didn’t involve returning officers (ROs) and district returning officers from the judiciary, highlighting doubts about the ECP’s credibility.
“We went to another polling station but found out that our polling agents were forced to leave,” Barrister Gohar said.
Omar Ayub said that pre-poll rigging began with suspension of the internet, and alleged that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz did not “believe in transparency”.
He also showed a letter from RO of NA-8 Bajaur to the DRO, claiming that the RO alleged that an intelligence official had beaten the staff.
However, the letter has been debunked by the Bajaur administration as being ‘doctored’.
“Punjab police picked up and badly beat journalists. We also heard reports of agency personnel wearing Punjab police uniforms. Police also misbehaved with us and claimed they were helpless. We will take legal action against the DIG Gujrat, SP Investigation, DSP and SHOs… who also assaulted journalists,” he said.
Mr Ayub claimed that Shehbaz Sharif got fewer votes during the general elections than the candidate contesting on the PML-N ticket in by-election.
‘‘This is beyond comprehension.’’
“We will start protests, along with other parties, next Friday across the country.
’’Then we will hold another protest in Faisalabad, followed by organising a public meeting in Karachi on May 5, and then a series of public meetings will be held across the country,“ he said.
He said that police officials told them that intelligence agencies were not allowing voters to enter polling stations.
Sahibzada Hamid Raza alleged that the Punjab government was involved in rigging.
He said government officials forcefully obtained signatures on Form 45s and made videos while paying money to some individuals.
He suggested that cases of sedition, including Article 6, be registered against the Punjab government high-ups.
