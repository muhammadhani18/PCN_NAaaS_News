6,"PSO blaze in Islamabad caused by ‘electric spark from water cooler’, says report","Inquiry reveals fire ""probably"" spread on wider span due to spill-over from oil tanker.","ISLAMABAD: A six-member committee formed to probe the blaze at a petrol pump in Blue Area has revealed that the oil tanker caught fire due to an “electric spark” from a water cooler installed on the premises, officials told Dawn.
The incident occurred at a PSO site near Beverly Centre, Blue Area, on April 19 during the decanting of petrol from the oil tanker. Initially, the petrol pump’s staff succeeded in handling the fire, and the oil tanker driver efficiently drove the fire-hit vehicle away from the premises.
Subsequently, the district rescue teams arrived at the location to extinguish the fire and the petrol pump was sealed until clearance from relevant authorities to initiate operations.
Subsequently, District Magistrate Irfan Nawaz Memon ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and whether or not the SOP for unloading the supply from the tanker to the pump was followed. In this regard, a six-member committee was constituted to probe the matter comprising officials of the capital administration, the Capital Development Authority, and the police along with an employee of the PSO.

Inquiry reveals fire ‘probably’ spread on wider span due to spill-over from oil tanker

The inquiry report said at the preliminary stage of inquiry, the petrol pump’s CCTV footage was examined and it was found that the vehicle was offloading petrol into the petrol pump’s oil tank when an electric spark occurred at a water cooler adjacent to it. As the fire broke out, the nozzles of the oil tanker also caught fire.
The inquiry also found a live electricity connection adjacent to the underground petrol tanks (the unloading area). As it is against the SOPs regarding unloading petrol at petrol pumps, the petrol pump’s management tried to conceal the presence of live electric wire at the said location.
This committee was also verbally informed that a complete audit of this site was recently conducted by the PSO inspection team from Islamabad. However, the availability of the electric current near the petrol unloading site was ignored.
A perusal of the CCTV footage also showed that the probable cause of the spreading of fire on a wider span was the spillover of petrol from the oil tanker. “However, this possibility needs further probe,” it added.
“Unfortunately, there is no back-up electricity connection for the CCTV cameras, and as soon as the main electric switch of the petrol pump was turned off, there was a complete blackout as far as the further footage is concerned.”
It is pertinent to mention that the petrol pump is located right next to Beverly Centre, which houses a large number of offices, shops and restaurants. It is frequented by thousands of citizens, in addition to employees of businesses during the day.
On the day of the incident, had the fire not been controlled in time through the swift action by the rescue teams, there could have been a “more severe eventuality” for not just the petrol pump, but also the Beverly Centre.
“It is therefore recommended that a complete audit in all respects (technical, fire etc.) be carried out of the PSO petrol pump in question, and generally of all PSO petrol pumps in Islamabad to avoid a similar incident in future,” the report said. “Once the PSO petrol pump in question fulfils the SOPs set out by PSO (as OMC) after completion of the audit, it may be de-sealed under intimation of the city assistant commissioner.”

ISLAMABAD: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday jointly inaugurated the newly-constructed portion of 11th Avenue after renaming it as Iran Avenue.
Islamabad already has several roads named after foreign dignitaries. These include Faisal Avenue after former Saudi king Shah Faisal, Attaturk Avenue after Turkish hero Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Roads were also named after Chinese leader Zhou Enlai and former Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser while there is also Japan Road.
Earlier on Sunday, the federal government renamed 11the Avenue as Iran Avenue. This road has two portions – one from D-12 to E-11 which has been constructed and the remaining seven km from E-11 to Karnal Sher Khan Avenue (formerly I.J. Principal Road) is yet to be constructed. But the entire road has been named as Iran Avenue. President Raisi and Mr Sharif at a function held at the PM Office opened the plaque of Iran Avenue.
Sources said the federal government had directed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to start work on the remaining portion of the road as soon as possible. The engineering wing on Monday decided to take up the matter with the CDA board in its meeting to be held on Tuesday (today) for its approval to hire a consultant.

The consultant will prepare the design of the road and then the civic agency will go for floating tenders. The portion 5.5km portion of the road, which was inaugurated on Monday, is linked with Margalla Road near D-12 and E-11 and the interchange of E-11 is also part of the project. 
As per its alignment, 11th Avenue starts from Karnal Sher Khan Avenue and culminates at its linking point of Margalla Road.
Work on the 5.5km road worth around Rs4 billion, including an interchange, was started in December 2022 and expected to complete by January 31 this year. However, its completion saw some delay and has been completed now. 
Iranian president’s wife visits Numl
Dr Jamileh-Sadat Alamolhoda, wife of the Iranian president, visited National University of Modern Languages (Numl).
Numl Rector retired Maj Gen Shahid Mahmood Kayani, the university’s director general Brig Shahzad Munir, pro-rector, deans, directors and a large number of students were present on the occasion. 
During her visit, the Numl rector awarded an honorary PhD degree in educational sciences to Dr Jamileh.
In her address, Dr Jamileh said Islam had enlightened the whole world with its teachings about knowledge 1,400 years ago, and knowledge without ethics had no value. She said during colonial era religious leaders of Iran and this part of the region played a significant role to keep the nations united. She admired the role of the great poet of the east Allama Iqbal and his invaluable role in preserving the Islamic message of knowledge and ethics.
Dr Jamileh also spoke at the launch of her own book ‘The Art of Living Femininely’ and said her book was being translated into Urdu as well. 
She praised Numl’s role in knowledge production and dissemination and also desired to explore the possibilities of mutual academic collaboration in the fields of science and technology and languages.
She also inaugurated a cultural festival at the university and visited national and international stalls showcasing various cultures and their traditions. 
Speaking on the occasion, the Numl rector said Pakistan and Iran were enjoying historic, brotherly and mutually trusted relations and both countries had deep-rooted people-to-people relations.

8,Islamabad finally gets new police chief,"ISLAMABAD: After the passage of several weeks, the new inspector general of the Islamabad police, Syed Ali Nasir...","ISLAMABAD: After the passage of several weeks, the new inspector general of the Islamabad police, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, arrived at the Central Police Office to assume charge of the top office.
As expected, three senior police officers – DIG Security, DIG Headquarters, and Safe City Director General – did not attend the ceremony to welcome their new boss, who is junior to them.
Although all four officers have the same 20-grade (DIG), DIG Security Awais Ahmed and DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza are from CTP-29 and Safe City Authority DG Mohammad Shoaib is from CTP-30. IGP Rizvi is from CTP-31.
Sources told Dawn that the DIG Headquarters did not come to work on Monday apparently to avoid saluting the new police chief, since the offices of the IGP and the DIG were located on the same floor at the CPO.
On the other hand, Safe City DG Shoaib, whose office in the Safe City Authority Building is merely 400 metres from the CPO, remained at his office and did not appear at the CPO, apparently for the same reason. The DIG Security also did not attend the ceremony for the very same reason, the insiders claimed.
Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi was appointed the IGP on March 29 whereas then-IGP Akbar Nasir Khan relinquished the charge on March 30 in a ceremony in which IGP Rizvi was slated to assume the charge. These three DIGs did not attend that ceremony as well and instead went on a five-day leave approved by the outgoing IGP. These officials also approached the Islamabad chief commissioner for a 15-day leave, which was turned down.
In light of the appointment of the new IGP, these three officers are marking efforts to get them transferred from the Islamabad police as they do not want to “serve” under a junior officer, sources said, adding that if they have to appear before the new chief, they will not wear their uniform cap to avoid saluting him. Under the rules, an officer not wearing a cap will not salute the senior officer.
The police PRO confirmed that the DIG Headquarters did not attend his office, while the DG Safe City remained in his office and did not appear in the ceremony and later before the IGP. The DIG Security was busy with the security measures for the visiting foreign delegation. The PRO expressed ignorance about the DIGs’ alleged efforts to seek leave or transfer from the capital police. He also did not know if the DIG Headquarters was on leave as he did not attend the office on Monday.

9,NAB agrees to end criminal proceedings against President Zardari,Written reply submitted in the Toshakhana vehicle reference by prosecution states that the president enjoys constitutional immunity.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has consented to an application seeking an end to criminal proceedings against President Asif Ali Zardari.
In a written reply submitted to the accountability court in the Toshakhana vehicle reference, the prosecution of NAB stated that President Zardari enjoys constitutional immunity. NAB earlier last week cleared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the reference.
 
 

According to the reference, President Zardari and Mr Sharif had obtained luxury cars from Toshakhana by paying only 15 per cent of the prices.
NAB alleged that ex-PM and the incumbent chairman Senate Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani facilitated the allotment of the vehicles to Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif by ‘dishonestly’ and ‘illegally’ relaxing the procedure for the acceptance and disposal of gifts vide a cabinet division memorandum of 2007.
The prosecution of NAB contended in the report that the vehicle concerned was gifted to then PM Nawaz by the government of Saudi Arabia and deposited in Toshakhana.
It added that later the car was included in the federal transport pool. In 2008, then PM Gilani offered Nawaz to buy the car at which the latter did so from the federal transport pool and not the Toshakhana, the NAB report said.
“This case may attract any other offence but has no relevancy with the benefit of Toshakhana as the subject vehicle when purchased was not part of Toshakhana rather was part of the federal transport pool,” it said.
It stated that Mr Sharif had not made the payment for the vehicle from a fake bank account, reiterating that the car was not part of the Toshakhana valuables when he bought it.
President Zardari claimed immunity as provided in Article 248 of the constitution against criminal proceedings.
Advocate Farooq H. Naek filed the application on behalf of Mr Zardari.
It claimed presidential immunity in Toshakhana vehicles, Park Lane estate, Thatta water supply and fake bank accounts references.
Article 248(1) of the constitution says: “The President, a Governor, the Prime Minister, a Federal Minister, a Minister of State, a Chief Minister, and a Provincial Minister shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise of powers and performance of functions of their respective offices or for any act done or purported to be done, in the performance of those functions”.
Article 248(2) says, “No criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or pursued against the president or a governor during his term of office”.
Article 248(3) adds that “no process for arrest or imprisonment of the president or a governor shall issue from any court during his term of office”.
In the Park Lane case, NAB had accused Mr Zardari of being involved “in extending loan and its misappropriation by M/s Parthenon Private Limited, M/s Park Lane Estate Private Limited and others”. NAB alleged that Park Lane company had received a loan of Rs1.5 billion, which later increased to Rs2.8bn, from a joint venture of the National Bank of Pakistan and Summit Bank. The company later defaulted to this amount.
Thatta water supply reference alleged that the accused had illegally awarded different contracts to private contractors.
Mr Zardari and Ijaz Khan, Hassan Ally Memon, who headed the committee responsible for procurements related to the water supply scheme, Omni Group CEO Khawaja Abdul Ghani Majeed, Menahel Majeed and nine others are among the accused persons.
The fake bank accounts case has been transferred from the accountability court Islamabad to the banking court Karachi.
Mr Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur and others are facing charges related to the opening of fake bank accounts and engaging in illegal transactions amounting to billions of rupees.

11,Over Rs100bn to be spent on road projects in Taxila,TAXILA: Member District Monitoring Committee and former provincial minister Jahangir Khanzada has said that a sum of...,"TAXILA: Member District Monitoring Committee and former provincial minister Jahangir Khanzada has said that a sum of Rs106.824 billion would be spent on the execution of 47 different road rehabilitation and improvement projects across the district in the current this year.
He expressed these views while addressing a public gathering after the inauguration of the rehabilitation of the Asghar village to Akhori village road on Monday.
PML-N Hazro chapter president Malik Ansar Ahmed, social and public figures Talal Ashraf Butt and Riaz Khan were also present on the occasion.
The 3.25km road would be completed at a cost of Rs10.5 million and would be completed during the current fiscal year.
“These link roads would not only provide better communication to people living in rural areas but also facilitate growers and farmers in transporting their cash crops to various markets as the area is known for producing quality vegetables and fruits,” he said.
Mr Khanzada was of the view that after the completion of the project, not only the general public but also farmers would be better able to access markets from farms and reduce their transportation costs.
The former minister said the government was giving priority to the road sector to ensure control of fatal accidents, flow of traffic and better travel facilities for commuters.
On this occasion, he directed the officials of the department concerned as well as those of the local administration that, besides completing the development projects on time, funds should be used transparently.
He warned that the use of substandard material in the execution of development projects, especially roads and infrastructure, would not be tolerated, and strict action would be taken against officials who indulged in corrupt practices.
Later, Mr Khanzada also performed the ground-breaking ceremony of the government girls primary school in Asghar village. The school would cater to the educational needs of hundreds of minor girls in Asghar and nearby villages, he added.
Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony, the former minister said not a single school had been established in Hazro tehsil during the last four years as the provincial government had not taken practical steps for strengthening the education sector, especially at the primary level, and today the early education system was on the verge of collapsing due to paucity of facilities and a shortage of teaching staff.
He said the provincial government would use all its resources to strengthen the education and health sectors in Attock, especially in Chach area. He said the provision of basic amenities and the latest municipal services to the people was the top priority of the government.
