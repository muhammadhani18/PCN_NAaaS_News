The company slashed retail prices by up to $2,000, on vehicles such as  the Model 3 and Model Y. These will take effect in several markets which  includes the US, China and Germany, later this week. This will be  Tesla’s most recent strategy to boost demand that had decreased due to  high interest rates. The cuts come ahead of its quarterly earnings this  Tuesday (today). The world’s most valuable automotive producer is  expected to post its first revenue drop and lowest gross margin, in  nearly four years, according to LSEG data. Tesla has been grappling with  declining sales and an intensifying price war, especially against  electric vehicles (EVs) produced in China.
Tesla stocks tumbled by 4 per cent on Monday, as its latest global price cuts fanned Wall Street concerns with regards to dwindling margins, for the electric-vehicle maker. This comes in the run-up to its earnings report, later this week.
Investors are anticipating much needed clarity from CEO, Elon Musk, on Tesla’s strategy. Musk had cut the company’s staff by 10pc in the week that passed. He said focusing on autonomous driving was a “blindingly obvious” move.
Earlier this month, Tesla’s CEO had announced an event scheduled for August, to unveil its “Robotaxi”

1,"Iraq, Turkiye agree to cooperate against Kurdish militants",Iraqi PM says two countries would cooperate to bolster border security and act against non-state armed groups that could be working with terrorist organisations.,"BAGHDAD: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said relations with Iraq were entering a new phase after the neighbours agreed to cooperate against Kurdish militants, boost economic ties via a new trade corridor and consider Iraq’s needs for access to scarce water.
Erdogan was in Iraq on a long-awaited visit, the first by a Turkish leader since 2011, following years of strained relations as Ankara ramped up cross-border operations against PKK militants based in mountainous, mainly Kurdish northern Iraq.
“I shared my belief that the PKK’s presence in Iraq will end. We discussed the joint steps we can take against the terrorist organisation PKK and its extensions targeting Turkiye,” Erdogan said at a joint news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad.
The two countries agreed to a strategic framework agreement overseeing security, trade and energy as well as a 10-year deal on the management of water resources that would take Iraq’s needs into account, Sudani said.
Sudani said the two countries would cooperate to bolster border security and act against non-state armed groups that could be working with terrorist organisations. He did not mention the PKK specifically.
An Iraqi government spokesperson said PKK members were welcome in Iraq so long as they did not engage in political activism or carry weapons. He did not elaborate.
The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 and is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara and its Western allies. Turkiye has conducted a series of cross-border operations against the group in northern Iraq since 2019.

2,Poland ready to host Nato’s nuclear arms,WARSAW: Poland’s president on Monday said his country is ready to host Nato’s nuclear arms after Russia...,"WARSAW: Poland’s president on Monday said his country is ready to host Nato’s nuclear arms after Russia reinforced its armaments in neighbouring Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
Poland, a Nato member and a staunch supporter of Ukraine, shares a border with both Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, Moscow’s ally.
“If our allies decide to deploy nuclear arms on our territory as part of nuclear sharing to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, we are ready to do so,” Duda said in an interview published by the Fakt daily. Moscow in response warned it would take steps to  “ensure its security”.
Duda spoke to the Polish media after a visit to New York, where he held meetings at the UN and discussed the war in Ukraine with former US president Donald Trump.
In March, he visited Washington DC, where he met with US President Joe Biden.
Discussions about nuclear cooperation between Poland and the United States have been going on  “for some time”, he said. “I have already talked about this several times. I must admit that when asked about it, I declared our readiness,” Duda said.
“Russia is increasingly militarising Kaliningrad. Recently it has been relocating its nuclear weapons to Belarus,” he added.
Speaking to reporters later on Monday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he  “would have to understand the president’s intentions,” suggesting the matter had not been discussed between them. “I would have to know all the circumstances that prompted the president to make this declaration,” Tusk said.
“I’m looking forward to meeting President Duda, because the matter directly and very clearly concerns Polish security,” Tusk added.

3,"Germany, Britain act against ‘Chinese spies’",Beijing rejects espionage accusations.,"BERLIN: Germany and Britain on Monday both swooped on suspected spies accused of passing on secret information to China, as concern deepens in the West over aggressive Chinese espionage.
In Germany, investigators arrested three German nationals in the west of the country suspected of sharing information on maritime technology, prosecutors said in a statement.
The trio, named as Herwig F., Ina F. and Thomas R., are accused of taking part in an information-gathering project funded by Chinese state agencies, as well as illegally exporting a laser to China.
In Britain, two men were charged with handing over  “articles, notes, documents or information” to China between 2021 and last year. Police named the men as Christopher Berry, 32, and Christoper Cash, 29, who previously worked at the UK parliament as a researcher.

Beijing rejects espionage accusations

The German arrests and British charges come amid repeated Western warnings of Chinese intelligence services targeting advanced technologies. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned of the  “considerable danger posed by Chinese espionage in business, industry and science”.
“The area affected in the current case — innovative technologies from Germany that can be used for military purposes — is particularly sensitive,” Faeser said.
Defaming China
China  firmly rejects accusations that it carried out spying activities in  Germany, its embassy in Berlin said on Monday, after three Germans were  arrested on suspicion of working with the Chinese secret service.
“We  call on Germany to desist from exploiting the espionage accusation to  politically manipulate the image of China and defame China,” a  spokesperson for the embassy said in an emailed statement.
The  arrests came a week after Chancellor Olaf Scholz travelled to China to  press Beijing on its support for Russia’s wartime economy and to raise  issues of intellectual property theft and fair market access.Germany’s first national security strategy, unveiled last year, was noticeably tough on China and accused Beijing of repeatedly acting against Berlin’s interests.
‘Extensive business’
In its 2023 annual report, the German military’s counter-intelligence service (MAD) also warned against potential espionage as China seeks to become a technological world leader by 2049. In particular, it mentioned joint projects with the German armed forces as a major risk.
German domestic intelligence chief Thomas Haldenwang said the security authorities were  “very vigilant” on the issue of Chinese espionage. Although he did not want to call the latest case the  “tip of the iceberg”, Haldenwang said it was  “certainly part of a very extensive business”.
One of the suspects in the German case, Thomas R., is accused of working as an agent for an employee of the Chinese ministry of state security (MSS). 
He is said to have established contact with Herwig F. and his wife Ina F., who ran a company in Duesseldorf with expertise in technologies that could be used for military purposes.

4,BBC anchor quits after furore over photos,"Edwards, 62, had been the BBC’s lead presenter in key events, such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, but was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.","LONDON: Veteran news anchor Huw Edwards resigned from the BBC on Monday on  “medical advice”, the broadcaster said, nine months after he become embroiled in a scandal over sexually explicit images involving a teenager.
Edwards, 62, had been the BBC’s lead presenter in key events, such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, but was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.
“Huw Edwards has today resigned and left the BBC,” the broadcaster said in a statement. “After 40 years of service, Huw has explained that his decision was made on the basis of medical advice from his doctors.
“The BBC has accepted his resignation which it believes will allow all parties to move forward. We don’t believe it appropriate to comment further.”
Earlier this year the BBC apologised to the family of the man who the broadcaster said Edwards had paid for sexually explicit pictures when he was a teenager.
As the accusations became front-page news last July, Edwards’ wife Vicky Flind said the father-of-five was  “suffering from serious mental health issues” and had been admitted to hospital.
The man’s family had complained to the BBC about Edwards in May 2023.

5,Iranians make first Umrah after Saudi ties restored,"TEHRAN: Iranian Muslims travelled on Monday to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, a year-round pilgrimage they had been barred...","TEHRAN: Iranian Muslims travelled on Monday to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, a year-round pilgrimage they had been barred from for almost a decade over a rift between Tehran and Riyadh, Iranian state media said.
“The first group of Umrah pilgrims departed Iran for Saudi Arabia through the Imam Khomeini airport in Tehran,” Iran’s official news agency IRNA reported.
They are the first Iranians to make the pilgrimage since Tehran and Riyadh agreed in a China-brokered deal last year to restore ties and reopen their respective embassies after more than nine years.
Iranians have already been allowed back at the Haj pilgrimage last year, but Umrah had remained off-limits for them until now.
Saudi Arabia and Iran severed ties in 2016 after Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran were attacked during protests over Riyadh’s execution of a top Shia religious scholar of Saudi Arabia, Ayatollah Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr. Ayatollah Nimr’s execution was widely condemned by governments and human rights organisations. He was popular among the youth for being critical of the Saudi Arabia government and for calling free elections in Saudi Arabia. 
Iranian state media has said in recent months that pilgrims would be able to head to the Saudi holy city of Makkah for Umrah, but blamed technical difficulties for repeated delays.

6,‘Staggering’ number of workers facing climate change-induced health hazards: UN,"GENEVA: A large majority of workers worldwide are facing a cocktail of health hazards linked to climate change, the...","GENEVA: A large majority of workers worldwide are facing a cocktail of health hazards linked to climate change, the United Nations said on Monday, warning that existing regulations offered inadequate protection.
“A staggering number of workers are already being exposed to climate change-related hazards in the workplace and these figures are only likely to get worse,” the UN’ International Labour Organisation said in a report.
Farm workers and others who carry out heavy labour in hot climates especially  “may be exposed to a cocktail of hazards”, the ILO said. These hazards include excessive heat, UV radiation, air pollution, vector-borne diseases and agrochemicals.
Those working in hot indoor environments or poorly ventilated spaces are also at risk. “Workers are among those most exposed to climate change hazards yet frequently have no choice but to continue working, even if conditions are dangerous,” the report said.
It pointed out that in 2020 — the last year for which statistics are available — 2.4 billion workers, or more than 70 per cent of the global workforce, were estimated to be exposed to excessive heat at some point. That marks  “a clear increase”, Manal Azzi, the ILO’s senior specialist on occupational safety and health, told reporters in Geneva.
The number of exposed workers had ballooned by 35 per cent over two decades, and even adjusting for the growing global population, the percentage of the labour force affected had swelled by 8.8pc since year 2000, she said.
‘Huge issue’
“This is a huge issue,” Azzi said, warning that  “workers are often forgotten when we’re talking about climate change, and the health impacts are very severe”.
Nearly 23 million occupational injuries attributed to excessive heat are reported each year, costing, on estimate, nearly 19,000 lives annually. And those numbers do not include the more than 26 million people who live with chronic kidney disease linked to workplace heat stress, the ILO said.
Furthermore, the impact of global warming on workers goes well beyond heat exposure.
The report noted that numerous dangerous health conditions in workers had been linked to climate change, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, kidney disfunction and mental health conditions.
The ILO said 1.6 billion workers worldwide were estimated to be exposed to UV radiation each year, with more than 18,960 work-related deaths annually from non-melanoma skin cancer. Another 1.6 billion people were likely to be exposed to workplace pollution, resulting in up to 860,000 deaths among outdoor workers annually.
More than 870 million agricultural workers are meanwhile likely to be exposed to pesticides, with more than 300,000 deaths attributed to pesticide poisoning each year.
And 15,000 work-related deaths each year are attributed to exposure to parasitic and vector-borne diseases, the report said.
“It’s clear that climate change is already creating significant additional health hazards for workers,” Azzi said in a statement. “It is essential that we heed these warnings. Occupational safety and health considerations must be become part of our climate change responses — both policies and actions.”

7,"UNRWA has robust neutrality steps,  Israel yet to back up claims, says review","UN chief accepts recommendations from independent review, calling on all countries to actively support the agency","BEIRUT: A review of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has found that it has robust frameworks to ensure compliance with humanitarian neutrality principles though issues persist, in a report which could prompt some donors to review funding freezes.
The report, released on Monday, also said Israel had yet to provide supporting evidence for its claim — based on a staff list it was given in March — that a significant number of UNRWA staff were members of terrorist organisations.
The United Nations appointed former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna to lead the UNRWA neutrality review in February after Israel alleged that 12 UNRWA staff took part in the Hamas-led Oct 7 raid.
Israel stepped up its accusations in March, saying over 450 UNRWA staff were military operatives in Gaza.

UN chief accepts recommendations from independent review, calling on all countries to actively support the agency

In a separate investigation, a UN oversight body is looking into the Israeli allegations against the 12 UNRWA staff.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has accepted the recommendations, his spokesperson said, calling on all countries to actively support UNRWA as it is  “a lifeline for Palestine refugees in the region”.
The report said Israel had made public claims based on an UNRWA staff list provided to it in March that  “a significant number” of UNRWA staff were members of  “terrorist organizations”. “However, Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of this,” it said.
Israel’s allegations against the dozen UNRWA staff led 16 states to pause or suspend funding of $450 million to UNRWA, a blow to an agency grappling with the humanitarian crisis that has swept Gaza since Israel launched its offensive there.
Israel has long complained about the agency, founded in 1949 to care for Palestinian refugees. 
UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini in March warned of  “a deliberate and concerted campaign” to end its operations.
UNRWA says it terminated the contracts of 10 of the 12 staff accused by Israel of involvement in the Oct 7 raid, and that the other two are dead. UNRWA employs 32,000 people across its area of operations, 13,000 of them in Gaza.
Political views
UNRWA shares staff lists annually with Lebanon, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Israel, the review said. It noted that UNRWA has  “a more developed approach” to neutrality than other similar UN or aid groups.  “Despite this robust framework, neutrality-related issues persist,” it found.
It said these included some staff publicly expressing political views, textbooks with problematic content being used in some UNRWA schools, and politicised staff unions making threats against UNRWA management and disrupting operations.
In Gaza, UNRWA’s neutrality challenges included the size of the operation, with most personnel being locally recruited and also recipients of UNRWA services, the review said.
Some states had resumed UNRWA funding but had requested  “a reinforcement of UNRWA’s existing neutrality mechanisms and procedures, including staff vetting and oversight”.
The report recommended establishing  “a continuous vetting process, especially in the event of staff promotion”. It called UNRWA  “irreplaceable and indispensable to Palestinians’ human and economic development”.
Following the Israeli allegations against UNRWA staff, the United States, UNRWA’s biggest donor at $300-400 million a year, paused funding, then the US Congress suspended contributions until at least March 2025.—Reuters

8,Israeli troops storm back into Khan Yunis,"GAZA: Israeli troops fought their way back into an eastern section of Khan Yunis in a surprise raid, residents said...","GAZA: Israeli troops fought their way back into an eastern section of Khan Yunis in a surprise raid, residents said on Monday, sending people who had returned to abandoned homes in the ruins of the southern Gaza Strip’s main city fleeing once more.
Elsewhere in Khan Yunis, scores more bodies were recovered from what Palestinian authorities said were mass graves on the site of the city’s main hospital, abandoned by Israeli troops. Further south there were fresh air strikes on Rafah, the last refuge where more than half of the enclave’s 2.3 million people have sought shelter.
Israel abruptly pulled most of its ground troops out of the southern Gaza Strip this month after some of the most intense fighting of the seven-month-old war. Residents have begun making their way home to previously unaccessible neighbourhoods of what had been the enclave’s second-biggest city, finding homes reduced to rubble and unrecovered dead in the streets.
“This morning many families who had left here in the past two weeks to go back home to Abassan came back. They were too frightened,” Ahmed Rezik, 42, said from a school where he is sheltering in the western part of Khan Younis, referring to a district in the east.
“They said tanks pushed in the eastern area of the town under heavy fire, and they had to run for lives,” he said via a chat app.
Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, accused Israel of carrying out  “executions” at the hospital and covering up the crimes by burying bodies with a bulldozer.
Relatives have been coming to take away loved ones for reburial. Family members brought the body of Osama al-Shoubagy, one of those recovered inside the hospital grounds, to a graveyard on Monday to rebury him next to his sister, to whom he had once donated a kidney when she was sick.
“My young daughter asked me to visit the grave of her father. I would tell her that as soon as we bury him, we will visit him. Thank God. The scene is tough, but we might find some relief after burying him,” said his wife Soumaya.
In one hand she held a few yellow flowers, in the other, the hand of their small daughter Hind, who wore a pale yellow Disney  “Frozen” tracksuit to say goodbye to her father.
“He loved me, (and used to) buy things for me, and he used to take me out,” the small girl said by the side of the new grave.
Air strikes
Gaza residents reported air strikes in several other areas, including Rafah, where a day earlier doctors had performed a caesarean section to save a baby from the womb of his mother who was among those killed.
In Nusseirat in central Gaza, officials said an air strike had damaged solar panels the hospital relies on for power.

Since Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 raid on Israel, there have been near-daily cross-border exchanges of fire between the Israeli army and Hezbollah.
With Israel-Iran tensions at an all-time high, the Lebanese group has intensified its attacks on Israel military targets across the border.
A Hezbollah statement said it had bombarded  “the headquarters of the 3rd Infantry Brigade of the 91st Division at Ein Zeitim Base with dozens of Katyusha rockets”.
This was in response to Israeli attacks on  “southern villages and civilian homes”, most recently in Srifa, Odaisseh and Rab Tlatin.
Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reported Israeli strikes on the three villages on Monday.
The Israeli military said  “approximately 35 launches were identified crossing from Lebanon into the area of Ein Zeitim in northern Israel” and that no injuries were reported.
It said  “troops struck the sources of the launches”.
Since October 7 at least 376 people have been killed in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but also 70 civilians, according to a tally.
Israel says 10 soldiers and eight civilians have been killed on its side of the border.

10,200 bodies exhumed  at Gaza hospital,"When asked for comment, the Israeli military said: “We will come back to you on the matter.”","GAZA STRIP: Gaza’s Civil Defence agency said on Monday that health workers had uncovered around 200 bodies over the past three days of people killed and buried by Israeli forces at a hospital in Khan Yunis.
When asked for comment, the Israeli military said:  “We will come back to you on the matter.” Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defence, said that  “civil defence crews are still recovering bodies from inside Nasser Medical Complex, and since Saturday bodies of nearly 200 martyrs have been retrieved”.
Bassal said several of the recovered bodies had decomposed.
“There is difficulty in the process of identifying them but civil defence efforts are ongoing,” he said. On Sunday, Bassal said that some of those killed had been tortured.
Ismail al-Thawabta, head of the Hamas government media office in the Palestinian territory, gave a higher figure of 283 bodies found at the hospital.
“We discovered mass graves inside Nasser Medical Complex” of people killed by  “the occupation (Israeli) army”, Thawabta said.
“We demand an international investigation to closely examine these crimes against civilians, children, and women,” he said.
Muhammad al-Mughayyir, a senior official at the civil defence agency, also confirmed the discovery of corpses at the facility and said the work to retrieve the remaining bodies would continue until Thursday.
Intense fighting raged in mid-February in the area of Nasser hospital and Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles surrounded it on March 26. Hospitals in Gaza have not been spared in the Israeli assault.The World Health Organisation said on April 6 that the Palestinian territory’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, had been reduced to ashes by an Israeli siege last month, leaving an  “empty shell” containing many bodies.
