""Khan's struggle is not against the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) or the establishment, but against the interests of the state,"" Sharjeel said.
Speaking at a press conference at the Karachi Press Club, the minister stated that during the 2018 elections, India and Israel funnelled money to support Khan, leading to his imposition on the country through unprecedented rigging. Despite his questionable record, he was appointed as prime minister.
Sharjeel said that the new generation should heed the prophecies of Dr Israr Ahmed and thoughts of Abdul Sattar Edhi about Imran Khan.
He further alleged that the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has spent a billion rupees in a year to commute between Bani Gala and the PM House.
Sharjeel asserted that Imran had offered the former Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan General Qamar Javed Bajwa a lifetime extension, urging him to prevent the success of the no-confidence motion against him. ""Imran Khan was constitutionally and legally ousted from power through a motion of no confidence,"" he said.
He said that the conduct of PTI miscreants during President Asif Ali Zardari's address at the Parliament House and Bibi Aseefa Bhutto Zardari's swearing-in was reprehensible.
Memon said that the former prime minister had initiated the politics of division within society, pitting brother against brother.
He stated that despite not even six months passing, he has been accorded VIP treatment in jail, orchestrating political manoeuvres from behind the bars, convening government and cabinet meetings, distributing tickets, and engaging with various stakeholders.
PTI has made no sacrifices and cannot be considered a political party, added.
While addressing the concerns of journalists, he reiterated that the efforts of his party will persist in meeting the longstanding demands of media houses, ensuring the salaries of journalists, and resolving all their issues, including access to free medical facilities.
