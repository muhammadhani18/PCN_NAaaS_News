Addressing a press conference at the JI Karachi headquarters, on Tuesday, Hafiz Naeem warned of strong resistance if the elections are rigged.
The JI leader pointed out that the ECP's recent orders for transfers of some presiding officers raise suspicions about the impartiality of the electoral process. He suggested that the reported transfers could be an attempt to manipulate the elections in favour of certain political parties, which would be a breach of trust by the ECP.
He stated that the ECP had already damaged its reputation during the local government elections in Karachi. He expressed concern that additional ballot papers were reportedly being provided to selected presiding officers, raising the risk of result manipulation. He emphasised that the ECP would be held accountable if any such rigging occurs and highlighted the ECP's responsibility to ensure a level playing field for all parties.
The JI leader urged political activists to remain vigilant and detect any potential rigging. He announced that the JI had formed vigilance teams to monitor the polling process and respond promptly with the support of the masses. Encouraging everyone to cast their votes, he emphasized the importance of preventing chaos in society.
Speaking about Karachi's current situation, Hafiz Naeem claimed that the JI was leading in popularity and votes, citing surveys that placed the party at the top ahead of the elections. He attributed the dynamics of votes in Karachi to the prevailing conditions in the mega city, highlighting unrest among Karachiites. Hafiz Naeem claimed that supporters of various parties, including PTI, MQM-Pakistan, and PPP, were inclined to vote for the JI in Karachi.
