0,IHC stays FIA proceedings against Aleema Khan,Ex-PM’s sister faces allegations of spreading hatred against the state,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has stayed the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from proceeding against Aleema Khan, sister of former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Chairman Imran Khan.
In two separate petitions, Aleema’s counsel sought suspension of the February 2 notice, orders to furnish evidence and record, while adopting the stance that notice was seen on social media and not received by the petitioner.
The court issued notices to the FIA for reply and adjourned the hearing till next week. The FIA cybercrime and counter-terrorism wing had issued separate notices. 
Earlier, the ex-PM’s sister once more failed to attend the summons by the FIA’s Counter-Terrorism Wing. The inquiry revolves around allegations of spreading hatred against the state and fostering division between the people of Pakistan and the armed forces.
The FIA’s Counter-Terrorism Wing in Islamabad had scheduled Aleema’s appearance for 11am on Tuesday, February 6. Despite her name being logged in the entry register, she did not present herself at the FIA headquarters even after office hours concluded.
The FIA initiated inquiry number 4 of 2024 based on a complaint filed by the Section Officer Policy of the Ministry of Interior. Under Section 160 of the criminal procedure code, a summon was dispatched to her Lahore residence on February 2, stipulating her appearance at 11 am. The notice explicitly stated that failure to appear would be construed as a tacit admission of guilt.
Prior to this, Aleema received a summons from the FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing in Islamabad on February 3, yet she did not attend that inquiry either.

1,Basant dates unveiled for twin cities amid ban,Basant in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad will be observed on February 16,"Basant in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad will be observed on February 16, Feb 23 and March 8 respectively, the Kite Flying Association Rawalpindi announced on Tuesday.
Per the schedule, Basant celebrations will kick off in Rawalpindi Cantt on Feb 16, and Rawalpindi city on Feb 23, while the kite flying will be observed in Islamabad on March 8. However, Basant will be delayed for a week in case of rain.
The Basant night will be held in Rawalpindi Cantt on Feb 15 at midnight and only white kites will be flown. Full Basant activities in Rawalpindi Cantt will start after Friday Prayer and continue till sunset Feb 16.
Vice Chairman of Kite Association, Haji Iqbal and another office-bearer Muhammad Riaz said that the Basant night in Rawalpindi city will be held after sunset on Feb 22 and will continue till midnight, while Basant in the city will be organised on Feb 23 (Friday).
Iqbal made it clear that no kite flyer would use glass-quoted string and those using such twine would be handed over to the police. He urged the district administration and police to wave off the ban on kite-flying as the association itself had restricted the use of glass-quoted twine.
The association’s office-bearers said that in case of “unjustified” arrests, the administration and police would be held responsible. Basant would be celebrated as a festival and that all arrangements have been completed, they added.
Iqbal said the Basant week has been delayed for a week because of the general elections.
He said two million kites and rolls of string have been arranged from other cities by the association, adding bookings for selling material are continuing online to the customers at their doorstep confidentially. The deliveries will be completed to the kite flyers by Feb 9 and 10.
On the other hand, Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema has declared a ban on kite-flying. He said that cases would be registered against violators and they would be arrested, adding the station house officers of all police stations have been also ordered to confiscate kites and strings.
Following the orders of the city police officer (CPO), the police have decided to get long ladders on rent to arrest the kite flyers from the rooftop.
There are reports that kite flyers have arranged food, barbeques, drums and trumpets at rooftops to celebrate Basant, besides arranging alternative routes to avoid police arrests. The kite lovers have also planned barricades to prevent the cops from approaching their streets. It is learned that aerial firing has also been planned on the eve of Basant.

2,Parties struggle to find female polling agents,"Political parties have increased the remuneration for women polling agents from Rs7,000 to Rs10,000","Political parties are facing difficulty in appointing female polling agents for women polling stations as many refused to take up the role.
After lack of interest in the position from educated women and female teachers, political parties have increased the remuneration for women polling agents from Rs7,000 to Rs10,000. Additionally, they have are offering a supply of groundnuts, sweets, roasted grams and oranges as part of the package.
In previous elections, families of the workers of the political parties were available as polling agents for free services under party policy. This time the female workers of political parties have refused to provide their services and a large number of female teachers have also refused.
Candidates are typically not trusting of unacquainted women to oversee the polling stations. Moreover, owing to the tense political climate, distrust has increased even more. It has been reported that many female workers offering their services refused to give up their identity cards on the polling day despite it being a requirement, which also caused suspicion.

3,‘Valley of Blood’ portrays Kashmiris’ suffering,Play was written by Aamir Zaryab and directed by Manwar Afridi,"A stage drama titled “Khoon Ki Wadi (Valley of Blood)” which was based on the atrocities committed by Indian forces against the Kashmiri people of Occupied Kashmir, was presented at the Punjab Arts Council (PAC) on Kashmir Solidarity Day.
The play was written by Aamir Zaryab and directed by Manwar Afridi. It featured acting talents such as Arshad Khan, Karim Khan, Shazia Sheikh, Rabia Shah, Yaqub Sheikh, Kashif Raza, Hamid, Parvez Malik, Saim and others. The artists gave a heart-touching performance that drove the message of injustices done against oppressed people at home.
A large number of people from the twin cities had turned up to watch the play. The chief guest invited at the event was PCA Board of Management President, Saqib Rafiq. Speaking on the day, he said “Human rights violations committed by India in Occupied Kashmir are unprecedented in history and the silence of world powers on this grave matter is sad.”
He went on to assure that Pakistan will continue to provide political, diplomatic and moral support to Kashmiris and asserted that the United Nations will have to play its role in solving the Kashmir problem. He concluded his speech by congratulating all the actors and crew involved in the drama for presenting their best performance.
PAC Director Waqar Ahmed while giving context to the Kashmir problem said “On August 5, 2019, the special status of Kashmir was abolished, and this only led to the freedom spirit of Kashmiris heightening.”
“Kashmir is suffering the most atrocities. Human rights organisations around the world are also aggrieved about the worst kind of state terrorism that is going on over there. But the silence of the United Nations and the European Union on the violation of human rights in the occupied valley is beyond comprehension,” he expressed.

9,Call to move away from iTFAs,Experts say trans fatty acids found in baked & fried goods pose serious health hazards,"A symposium was held in the federal capital on the health hazards of trans fatty acids (TFAs), where experts stressed the need for stakeholders’ engagement and capacity building of regulators to enforce harmonised standards to counter its hazards.
TFAs are fatty acids that are naturally occurring in meat and dairy products, whereas iTFAs are produced after hydrogenation and are mainly found in bakery products, and frozen and refrigerated items.
The symposium titled, ‘Reducing Industrial Trans Fatty Acids (iFTAs)’ in Pakistan was jointly organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and Cargill Pakistan.
Islamabad Food Regulatory Authority Deputy Director, Dr Tahira Siddiqui, in her presentation, said “Pakistan is the second highest consumer of iTFAs in the world as after petroleum products, its edible oil imports were the largest, worth $4.3 billion.”
Stressing the need to ensure dialogue between industry and technical experts to shift from iTFAs, she said, “Industries need to come up with alternatives to iTFAs in their production process and when choosing raw materials. For this purpose, they can be given incentives to promote a shift from iTFAs towards embracing alternatives.” She added that it is a complex challenge to eradicate iTFAs, however it can be achieved by adopting efficient policies, and multifaceted approaches to engage all stakeholders.
Tehzeeb Bakers Consultant Saqib said there is no facility for the isomerisation of edible oils in Pakistan, which means that iTFAs control is only possible through controlled processing, and proper selection of raw materials that come from vegetable sources.
“Most of our food is unregulated street food. Since the TFAs are drivers of many serious diseases, food authorities must regulate street food,” added Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Food Safety Expert Dr Zafar.
During his talk, SDPI Executive Director, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri emphasised that multisectoral dialogues are required for managing dynamic issues like the injurious impact of iTFAs on health. He said that the prime areas of focus in terms of food security are the availability, affordability, accessibility, and nourishment value of food items.
“While the West is grappling with the crisis of malnourishment leading to obesity, Pakistan tackles the challenges of a different public lifestyle owing to its economic situation and culture,” he explained.
