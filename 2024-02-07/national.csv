0,Rupee stable at three-month high,Dollar supply and demand appear evenly balanced,"Pakistani currency on Tuesday stood stable above three-month high at Rs279.42 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market as foreign currency supply and demand appeared evenly balanced.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee ticked down Rs0.01 on a day-on-day basis, closing at Rs279.42 against the greenback.
The domestic currency has cumulatively increased 9.90%, or Rs27.68, in the past over four months compared to the record low of Rs307.10/$ hit in the first week of September 2023.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the rupee slightly appreciated by Rs0.03 and closed at Rs281.13/$ in the open market.
The difference between currency values in the two markets remained moderate at 0.61%, or Rs1.71, compared with the maximum spread of 1.25% (around Rs4 at the current exchange rate) recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The rupee remained stable after both import payments and export earnings increased for January 2024, suggesting that the demand and supply of foreign currency was quite balanced in the market.
Market talk suggests that the rupee will continue to move around current levels till the next political government is formed in the aftermath of general elections scheduled for Thursday (February 8).

Later, the demand and supply of foreign currency will depend on the economic policies and reform agenda to be pursued by the new government.
The currency market will closely observe government’s moves to see whether it will again approach the IMF for another bailout package. At present, Pakistan is under a $3 billion standby arrangement with the IMF, which will end in March this year.
The timing of the new loan programme will give a clear direction to the rupee-dollar exchange rate. Any delay will mount pressure on the rupee.
Secondly, if the government opts to ramp up imports without improving export proceeds and inflows of worker remittances, it will also put the rupee under pressure.

2,Smartphone scheme faces opposition,"Proposal for easy instalments draws concerns over import bill, commercial directives","Cabinet members and two telecom operators have opposed the scheme of providing smartphones to the public on easy instalments.
The issue was taken up in a meeting of the cabinet held last month by the Ministry of Information Technology & Telecommunication, which proposed to issue a policy directive to encourage Cellular Mobile Operators (CMOs), as well as agencies working under agreement with CMOs, to provide smartphones to the public on easy instalments.
The ministry’s proposal was discussed in detail. However, some cabinet members observed that issuing a policy directive for a commercial activity did not seem appropriate for the Cabinet.
Cabinet members added that the proposed scheme might lead to an increase in the import of smartphones, and thereby also in the import bill of Pakistan, which had to be paid in foreign exchange.
Cabinet members further pointed out that of the four CMOs in the country, only two companies had concurred with the draft policy, whereas the remaining had opposed the proposal.
A member of the Cabinet reiterated that there was no precedent for a Cabinet directive relating to any commercial activity. Some members felt the policy directive could be unacceptable in the case of locally manufactured goods. They said that louder consultation was needed first.
The Ministry of Information Technology & Telecommunication (IT&T) explained that mobile broadband proliferation had a significant impact on increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), foreign direct investment, exports, and generating new business and employment opportunities.
Broadband services in Pakistan were playing a pivotal role in all sectors, particularly commerce, banking, health, and governance.
It was added that the current mobile broadband density in the country was almost 53%.
Read AI Pin: a futuristic tech unable to replace smartphones
It was further explained that a major deterrent to widespread adoption was the affordability of smartphones by the masses.
The ministry was, therefore, of the view that in order to minimise the digital divide and provide broadband services easily accessible to all communities, it was imperative to make smartphones affordable for users.
It was stated that the IT ministry had held consultations with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the Telecom Industry.
It had finalised the final draft policy directive to encourage Cellular Mobile Operators (CMOs), as well as agencies working under agreement with CMOs, to provide smartphones to the public on easy instalments.
The draft directive also contained remedial measures to deal with those defaulting on payments, along with a clause to review the directive after six months, if necessary.
The Ministry of IT&T argued that section 8(2A) of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-Organisation) Act, 1996, empowered the federal government to issue policy directives on any matter related to the telecommunications sector, provided that it was not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act.
The Ministry of IT&T solicited approval of the Cabinet for the draft policy directive.
The Cabinet considered the summary titled ‘Draft Policy Directive under Section 8(2A) of the Pakistan Telecommunications (Re-Organisation) Act 1996 for Enhancing Smartphone Penetration’ submitted by the Ministry of Information Technology & Telecommunication and directed the ministry to further analyse the proposal, hold broader consultations, and then resubmit a well-considered draft of the proposed policy for consideration by the Cabinet.

3,Cabinet okays PIA restructuring,Directs special panel to iron out differences over impact of airline’s bifurcation,"The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the restructuring of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) but directed its specialised panel to sort out differences between the ministries of finance and privatisation over financial implications of the bifurcation of the airline for the budget.
The cabinet gave the green light to invite interests from potential investors for selling 51% to 100% stake of PIA – Pakistan’s third highest loss-making entity. Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar chaired the cabinet meeting.
The cabinet was apprised that the Supreme Court had barred the government in 2018 from taking further steps for PIA privatisation without its prior consent. The privatisation ministry has filed a petition to inform the court about the developments but it has not yet got a hearing date.
According to the PM Office, the cabinet approved the restructuring of PIA. The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) was directed to resolve the issue related to payables of government-owned departments, said a press statement.
The privatisation ministry did not first take the matter to the CCOP and took it directly to the cabinet. The CCOP, like the Privatisation Commission board, is also chaired by Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad, which leaves little room for an independent oversight.
The CCOP will meet on Wednesday to iron out differences between the finance ministry and the privatisation ministry.
The cabinet’s approval was sought for setting up a new holding company and transferring Rs622 billion to the firm, selling 51% to 100% stake of PIA and shifting the employees of Precision Engineering Complex (PEC) to the holding company. Cabinet members appeared to be in agreement but due to objections from the Ministry of Finance it was decided to hand over the new structure’s financial issues to the CCOP, according to a member of the cabinet.
Financial advisers have proposed a major incentive for the buyers by allowing the use of PIA’s deferred tax assets for 10 years instead of six years. However, this requires an amendment to the Income Tax Ordinance, which the finance ministry has opposed.
The cabinet gave approval for a bridge financing of Rs10 billion, to be arranged from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
The cabinet was informed that foreign investors could not buy more than 50% shares under the Civil Aviation Act and Air Service Agreements. So, the foreign investors would have to enter into an arrangement with local investors for acquiring majority shares.
The financial advisers have submitted the draft of restructuring, legal segregation and transaction structure. But they have failed to submit the valuation report.
Sources said that the finance ministry opposed the privatisation ministry’s proposal to write off PIA’s debt of Rs140 billion. It also expressed concerns that no firm timeline had been given for the airline’s privatisation. The Ministry of Finance opposed the transfer of Rs622 billion worth of debt to the holding company and instead recommended to keep some part of it with the core PIA. It also refused to provide any liquidity support to PIA before and after its privatisation.
In a major objection, the finance ministry said that there should be clarity about the valuation of PIA before and after its segregation. It opposed the extension of the benefit of deferred tax assets from six years to 10 years, saying it could set a precedent for other loss-making entities.
The Ministry of Finance’s main objection was that PIA’s debt and liabilities settlement plan should be prepared in a systematic manner. It opposed the privatisation ministry’s focus mainly on transferring Rs268 billion worth of commercial banks’ debt to the federal government books.
Read ECP asks govt to stop PIA privatisation
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday did not approve the PIA’s debt restructuring plan and sought more details, particularly the treatment of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), CAA and Pakistan State Oil (PSO) debt.
The finance ministry highlighted that the privatisation ministry had not yet secured the concurrence of all private and public sector lenders, and service providers for the segregation of PIA into two entities.
The financial advisers’ report revealed that as of September 2023, PIA’s equity turned negative by a whopping Rs663 billion.
It has been proposed that negotiations should be held with potential investors to retain PIA employees for three years. There is still a need to update PIA liabilities till December 31 before its bifurcation.
Core and non-core
The financial advisers recommended that the Precision Engineering Complex, Pakistan International Investment Limited owning Roosevelt Hotel and Scribe Hotel and certain real estate assets should be treated as non-core assets and should not be privatised.
All ancillary services including engineering, ground handling, cargo, flight kitchen and training, as core assets, should be retained in main PIA for privatisation. However, the advisers underlined that their treatment as core assets would depend on the investors’ willingness to buy them.
Liability plan
The financial advisers proposed that the liabilities of Rs622 billion as of September 2023 should be transferred to a new holding company along with assets. These transferable liabilities include Rs268 billion in commercial bank debt.
However, the government would need no-objection certificates from these banks before filing the scheme of arrangement with the SECP.
The Rs173 billion debt due to be paid to the federal government and advances from subsidiaries should also be transferred to the holding company. Similarly, all liabilities of Rs144 billion of the CAA, PSO and National Insurance Corporation Limited should be transferred to the holding company.
The advisers proposed to transfer Rs38 billion in pension liabilities to the federal government. The Rs6 billion worth of real estate, Rs6 billion in overdue advances and Rs8 billion worth of subsidiary balances are also proposed to be transferred to the holding company. The financial advisers proposed that the liabilities of Rs203 billion, mainly of foreign banks, should be retained in PIA along with Rs141 billion in operating assets.
The breakdown of Rs203 billion worth of liabilities showed that all commercial debt of Rs16 billion owed to foreign commercial banks should be retained in PIA. Payables of Rs64 billion to creditors mainly lessors and fuel suppliers should also be retained in PIA and offered to the buyers.
The advisers proposed that the operational liabilities of 104 billion related to fleet, employees deferred liabilities and trade payables may be retained in PIA.

The island nation’s central bank had suspended permission to remit funds for overseas investments by Sri Lankan residents from mid-2020 except under certain conditions.
“Sri Lanka’s reserves have gradually improved and limits will be increased under the guidance of the central bank,” Gunawardane told reporters during the weekly cabinet briefing.

The country of 22 million people is slowly recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades, which sent the economy into freefall with soaring inflation, currency depreciation and low foreign reserves.
Sri Lanka’s official reserves stood at $4.4 billion at the end of 2023, an increase of 22% according to the central bank. About $1.5 billion of the reserves is a Chinese yuan-denominated swap.

6,Stocks surge on debt settlement talk,"KSE-100 index rises 796.10 points, settles at 63,799.02","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday experienced a notable surge in an earnings season rally, driven by expectations of approval of proposals by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for resolving the circular debt crisis and addressing power tariff concerns.
In the morning, trading commenced on a lacklustre note when the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day low at 63,176.97 points. However, as the day progressed, optimism grew over S&P Global’s hint at a potential ratings upgrade for Pakistan, depending on collaboration with financial institutions to secure an IMF deal.
Additionally, upbeat data of exports and trade deficit for January 2024 contributed to the market’s positive sentiment. The index touched the intra-day high at 63,885.10 points well after midday. Notably, the exploration and production (E&P) sector saw significant gains and the bourse closed the day near the 64,000 mark.
“Stocks closed bullish on speculation about the IMF’s approval of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) proposals for resolving the power sector circular debt issue and addressing tariff concerns,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“S&P projections for ratings upgrade through working together with financial institutions for securing an IMF deal and upbeat data of exports and trade deficit for January 2024 played the role of catalysts in bullish close in an earnings season rally at the PSX.” At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 796.10 points, or 1.26%, and settled at 63,799.02.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, wrote that the KSE-100 index maintained its upward momentum in line with the previous week’s trend. “Notably, in the E&P sector, Oil and Gas Development Company (+5.71%) and Pakistan Petroleum (+5.39%) saw price increases, buoyed by news of the caretaker government’s formal discussions with the IMF to settle the gas sector circular debt to the tune of Rs1.2 trillion,” it said.
Activity was also observed in the cement sector, with DG Khan Cement (+2.64%), Lucky Cement (+1.08%) and Cherat Cement (+1.05%) closing higher than the previous day, partly due to the drop in international coal prices to $94 per tonne, Topline added.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, wrote that upside moves remained on target for 64k ahead of elections. “Some 68 stocks rose while 22 declined with Oil and Gas Development Co (+5.4%), Pakistan Petroleum (+5.27%) and Mari Petroleum (+3.47%) contributing the most to the index gains,” it said, adding that MCB Bank (+0.93%) announced results for 4QCY23 where earnings per share stood at Rs14.24, up 23% year-on-year but down 14% quarter-on-quarter.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the market opened on a positive note and the momentum continued throughout the day, mainly fueled by news of a potential one-off dividend declaration by E&P companies following approval from the IMF.
Overall trading volumes increased to 330.9 million shares against Friday’s tally of 263.5 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs15.2 billion.
Shares of 336 companies were traded. Of these, 230 stocks closed higher, 79 dropped and 27 remained unchanged.
Pakistan International Airlines was the volume leader with trading in 47.1 million shares, losing Rs0.1 to close at Rs10.84. It was followed by Oil and Gas Development Co with 23.1 million shares, gaining Rs7.97 to close at Rs155.57 and Cnergyico PK with 21.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.16 to close at Rs4.15.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs582.3 million, according to the NCCPL.

7,S&P hints at upgrading Pakistan’s credit rating,"Will monitor upcoming elections; pending economic reforms, IMF loan are key determinants","S&P Global Ratings has hinted at upgrading Pakistan’s credit rating to ‘B’ following the new political government that comes into power post-Thursday (February 8) elections in the country, but the change in the rating would largely depend on the economic roadmap of the new rulers.
To upgrade the rating, the global rating agency will closely watch the new government’s moves towards securing the next International Monetary Fund loan programme after the ongoing one, worth $3 billion, is completed in March 2024. The new programme will ensure the government continues to repay the maturing foreign debt on time.
According to the global media outlet Bloomberg, S&P sees a path for Pakistan’s upgrade to ‘B’ after the election results. Pakistan is currently rated ‘CCC+’ by the agency. The credit rating ‘B’ suggests the nation has the capacity to repay the foreign debt on time but still faces a degree of uncertainty that could lead to missing the repayment obligation later on.
Citing S&P, the media outlet reported, “Pakistan’s road to securing higher credit ratings will depend on whether the elections this week will bring about a government that can push for tough reforms.” A government with popular support and the ability to work with key institutions will have a better chance of securing financing from the IMF, S&P Analysts including Kim Eng Tan wrote in a February 4 report. “Together with new policy moves to improve investor confidence and bring down inflation, this could lift fiscal and external metrics sufficiently for the sovereign ratings to move to the ‘B’ rating category,” S&P said. 
The IMF's short-term nine-month programme is set to end in March 2024. This will also be the time when the new government will have come into power and announced its economic roadmap.
Read S&P 500 rises to highest close of 2023
Pakistan was to repay a total of $24.2 billion in foreign debt and in interest payment on the debt by the end of June 2024. High officials claim the government has the full arrangement for the debt obligation under the ongoing IMF loan programme. According to the State Bank of Pakistan latest updates announced a week ago, the country is to repay only $5 billion in the last five months (Feb-Jun) of the current fiscal year 2023-24.
It has repaid $6.2 billion in the first seven months of FY24 and rolled over another $12 billion, settling almost all the debt for the year. Pakistan’s business community has identified two major challenges for the upcoming government including securing a new loan programme from the IMF and re-profiling foreign debt obligations. Government action on both points will give direction to the domestic economy, as repaying the debt on time is a must to achieve growth from the domestic economy which is showing early signs of stability at present.
The business community said the next government should focus on boosting export earnings and increasing inflows of remittances, as these remain the key to long-lasting economic growth. The stability in currency is a must to achieve a jump in exports and remittances. The next government should also work to control inflation reading to pave the way for the central bank to cut the interest rate, which has been hovering at a record high 22% since June 2023. A rate cut is a must to allow businesses to perform. No one could make new investments at the prevailing high interest rate, they said. At the same time, the new government should work to minimise energy prices to make industries competitive at the local as well as the international levels. Pakistan has lagged behind in attracting foreign investment. To attract investment, the nation requires a strong government, strong business planning, and its implementation in letter and spirit, consistency in policies, political stability, and a stable currency, they said.

8,Energy body approves new refinery policy,Raises limit on withdrawal from escrow account,"The Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE) on Tuesday approved the new refinery policy where it enhanced the limit on withdrawing money from an escrow account from 25% to 27.5%.
Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) has already signed an agreement with the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) under the new refinery policy. However, other refineries refused to strike any deal with the regulator and raised several issues like the continuation of 7.5% deemed duty collection on diesel sales after upgrading their plants.
Other issues of concern for the refineries included the tax exemption on incremental capital expenditure (capex) to be deposited in the escrow account, project time and cost overruns. At a meeting held on Tuesday, the CCOE raised the cap on the withdrawal of money from the escrow account from 25% to 27.5%. This money will be spent on upgrading the refineries.
Under the new policy, the refineries expect Pakistan to become self-reliant in the production of diesel. The oil industry emphasises that the energy sector is the backbone of any economy but unfortunately the core challenges being faced in the realm of economy stem from ill-planning and mismanagement.
“It is, therefore, good to know that the oil refineries policy for upgrading the existing/brownfield refineries with some amendments has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Energy,” it said. The industry pointed out that the badly needed policy took more than four years in the making and final approval was delayed on one pretext or the other. The policy was finally notified on August 17, 2023 but it had some anomalies, which were not acceptable to the refineries. After intense and prolonged consultation among the government, refineries, independent financial and legal advisory firms, the policy was appropriately amended and approved by the CCOE in a meeting chaired by Minister of Energy Muhammad Ali on Tuesday.

“The last step needed now is its approval and ratification by the cabinet, which we hope will be done in the next few days,” it said. The policy will enable oil refineries to undertake major upgrade projects to not only comply with environmentally friendly Euro V specifications but also increase the production of deficit products such as petrol and diesel by 99% and 47%, respectively.
As part of the policy, they will reduce the output of furnace oil by 78% as its demand has gone down drastically in recent years, which often results in storage constraints forcing refineries to reduce capacity utilisation.
Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) Chairman and Attock Refinery Limited CEO M Adil Khattak, in a statement, said that refineries’ upgrade projects would bring an investment of $5 billion to $6 billion and will not only result in cleaner, environmentally friendly fuels but also ensure major savings of foreign exchange.

9,Clothing exports to China rise by 3% in 2023,"Strong demand fuelled by quality, trade advantages","The amount of clothing that Pakistan exported to China, both for men and women, significantly increased in the past year. Based on available data, the export of men’s and women’s clothing from Pakistan to China increased by 3% between January to December of 2023, said Ghulam Qadir, Commercial Counsellor at the Pakistani Embassy in Beijing.
The strong demand for Pakistani textiles in the Chinese market is reflected in this increase in exports. Pakistani men’s and women’s clothing has been sought after in China due to its quality and competitive prices, he told China Economic Net (CEN).

In addition, Pakistan enjoys a competitive advantage in land trade with China and zero tariffs under the Free Trade Agreement between the two countries. In the year 2023, Pakistani men’s garments exports to China touched $28.66 million. Women’s garments exports from Pakistan to China reached $10.46 million while last year in the same period it was $9.44 million, representing a rise of 11%.
The overall exports of men’s and women’s garments crossed $39.12 million and increased by 3% in the year 2023, he added. In addition, Qadir pointed out that in May, Pakistan organised the largest textile exhibition ever held in Karachi called TEXPO 2023 where around 120 representatives of China’s top textile enterprises participated and signed multi-million-dollar contracts at the Expo Centre.
