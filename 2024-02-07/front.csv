0,Internet services suspended in Makran,EMS project director says move taken a day before polls in view of security threats,"Internet services have been suspended in Makran region of Balochistan because of security threats, Election Management System (EMS) Project Director Col (retd) Muhammad Saad Ali on Wednesday revealed – just a day before the general polls.
Talking to media personnel in Islamabad, the EMS project director elaborated that there could be some delay in receiving the results because of the lack of internet.
He further said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) would receive the results on the second day if not the first.
“It’s not a major issue,” he added.
Col (retd) Saad continued that nothing could be guaranteed but as human beings, they had tried to ensure that there were no problems in the EMS on the day of the elections.
He told the media that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) had assured the ECP that there would be no power outages on the polling day.
The official explained that the presiding officers were being logged into the EMS.
He added that retuning officers (ROs) and field officers were being monitored from the control room in Islamabad.
The EMS project director said if the internet services were suspended, the presiding officer would have a problem in sending the results but not the ROs.
“Our target is that form 45 reaches the ROs on time.”
He explained that the communication between the presiding officer and the RO would be through the internet.
He continued that the ROs would announce the results as soon as they received them.
Col (retd) Saad said there might be delay in receiving the results from the offices of around 10% ROs.
Earlier, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) assured the nation that internet services would not be suspended in the country on February 8 or Thursday (today) – the day set for the general elections.
According to a statement issued by the PTA on Wednesday, users can expect internet facilities to be available without interruption or obstacles on the day of the elections.
The authority clarified that the interim government had not issued any directives for shutting down internet services on the polling day.
The confirmation came a day earlier after interim Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz dispelled rumours surrounding the February 8 polls, saying that until now the authorities had not received any directives to shut down internet services on the day of the elections.

He added that any such action would only be taken upon a request from a province or a district.
“As of now, no decision has been made to shut down mobile or internet services. However, if necessary, considerations are made based on security requests from specific districts or provinces [internet and mobile service will be suspended],” he remarked.
However on Tuesday, Ejaz had acknowledged the possibility of internet disruptions and shutdowns during Thursday’s polls.
This prompted the Amnesty International (AI), in collaboration with several other human rights organisations, to issue a call to authorities in Pakistan, urging them to guarantee uninterrupted access to internet and digital communication platforms for all citizens across the country during the elections.
Expressing concern over the potential limitations on internet access, the AI underscored the importance of upholding the right to freedom of expression as well as ensuring that citizens could freely share and access information online.
Internet services have been affected thrice in the past two months. The first time was on December 17, the second on January 7, and the latest one on January 20. The suspensions coincided with the PTI’s virtual events.
The interim government attributed the internet outages across the country to “technical issues”, stating that there was no assurance that such incidents would not recur in the future.
On January 24, the Sindh High Court restrained the relevant authorities from suspending internet services till the general elections.
The high court ordered the caretaker federal government and PTA to ensure uninterrupted internet services till the polling day.
The order came on a petition filed by human rights defender and lawyer Jibran Nasir, who is contesting the polls for PS-110 as an independent candidate, against the frequent “unconstitutional” internet outages in the country in recent days.
Recently, the PTI moved the Supreme Court, urging it to take notice of the disruption of popular social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube – on which the party was relying as a last resort to sway its voters and voice its concerns.

1,Pakistan vows it’ll ‘uphold democratic values’ in polls,FO response comes as OHCHR raises concern about ‘PTI leaders’ harassment’,"Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Wednesday maintained that Pakistan was determined to uphold fundamental freedoms for a democratic process, while responding to media queries about the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ (OHCHR) statement about today’s general elections in which it condemned the ‘harassment and detention of PTI leaders’ before the polls.
In her official statement, Mumtaz emphasised the country's unwavering commitment to promoting an ""inclusive democratic process, upholding the rule of law, and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed in its laws and Constitution"".
The spokesperson maintained that comprehensive security plans had been finalised to ensure the smooth conduct of the general polls scheduled for February 8 or Thursday (today) ""in accordance with Pakistan's electoral laws"".
She affirmed the integrity of Pakistan's judicial system, highlighting its provision for ""fair trial and due process"".
Mumtaz underscored that ""domestic legal remedies"" were readily available to address any complaints that might arise during the electoral process.
The FO spokesperson's remarks came a day after the UN human rights body condemned the “harassment” as well as “detentions” of PTI leaders before the elections and appealed to the Pakistani authorities to ensure fully free and fair polls.
Liz Throssell, the spokesperson for the OHCHR, urged the country’s authorities to condemn all acts of violence against political parties and candidates while emphasising the need to uphold fundamental freedoms for a democratic process.
""In the lead-up to the vote, there have been no less than 24 reported instances in which armed groups have staged attacks against members of political parties,"" Throssell pointed out in a statement.

She acknowledged the challenges Pakistan had faced over the past 15 years in maintaining democratic gains amid security and economic hurdles.
Throssell emphasised the significance of elections as a moment to reaffirm the country's commitment to human rights and democracy, ensuring the right to participation for all citizens, including women and minorities.
""We are disturbed by the pattern of harassment, arrests, and prolonged detentions of leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and their supporters during the election period,"" Throssell continued.
She highlighted multiple legal cases against PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan, which led to his disqualification as a candidate and sentencing him to long prison terms.
Throssell urged higher courts to carefully review these conclusions in line with due process and fair trial rights and Pakistan's international human rights obligations, emphasising the need for fair competition among all eligible parties.
The OHCHR also raised concerns about barriers faced by women and minority communities, particularly the Ahmadiyya community, in the election process. It pointed out that some parties appeared not to have met the legal quota of having 5% female candidates on their lists despite 22% of the seats in the National Assembly reserved seats for women.
Throssell observed that the separate voter lists for Ahmadis, exposing them to harassment and violence, was contrary to the equal rights guaranteed to minorities in Pakistan's Constitution.
The statement emphasised the importance of recommitting to the democratic process and creating an environment that promoted and protected a comprehensive range of rights, including economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights, all of which were interconnected.

2,26 perish in simultaneous Balochistan blasts,Bombs target election offices of JUI-F leader in Killa Saifullah; independent candidate Asfandyar Kakar in Pishin,"A surge in terrorist attacks has rocked Balochistan and Sindh on the eve of general elections, claiming the lives of 26 people. Two simultaneous bomb explosions targeted election offices in the Pishin and Killa Saifullah districts of Balochistan, while three individuals tragically died in a premature grenade explosion in Karachi.
Also in Balochistan, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leader Hafiz Hamdullah narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Chaman. Assailants opened indiscriminate fire on Hamdullah’s vehicle, but his guards bravely returned fire, repelling the attackers and ensuring his safety.
Earlier, tragedy struck as 12 people lost their lives and over a dozen were injured in a blast targeting the election campaign office of Maulana Abdul Wasey, the Balochistan Amir of the JUI-F.
“The JUI F’s office was targeted through an improvised explosive device (IED),” Killa Saifullah Deputy Commissioner Yasir Khan Bazai confirmed. Maulana Wasey was not at the office at the time of the explosion, he added.
In another bomb blast outside the election office of Asfandyar Khan Kakar, an independent candidate for PB-47, Pishin, at least 14 people were killed and over two-dozen more injured. Pishin Deputy Commissioner Jumadad Mandokhail said that the victims were supporters of Kakar.
“Terrorists had planted a bomb in a motorcycle parked outside the campaign office in Khanozai bazar,” Mandokhail said. The injured were rushed to the Khanozai Hospital. However, the seriously injured victims were later taken to the Trauma Center in Quetta.
Emergency was declared at the Trauma Centre in the Quetta Civil Hospital. “A total of 18 injured have been brought here,” civil hospital spokesperson Waseem Baig said. “The condition of five injured is serious,” he added.

Meanwhile, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Karachi East, Irfan Bahadur, reported that an act of sabotage was thwarted in the Gulshan-e-Iqbal neighborhood when a hand grenade exploded prematurely, resulting in the death of the alleged terrorist.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) East, Ghulam Azfar Mahesar, revealed that 17-year-old Farooq Mirani, son of Police Inspector Rehman Mirani, was leaving his house with the grenade in his hand. Upon seeing the bomb, children in the street raised the alarm.
Mahesar explained that Farooq attempted to conceal the bomb, but its safety pin was inadvertently pulled out, causing it to explode in his hands. Tragically, Farooq, along with two other civilians identified as Rehan and Nasreen, lost their lives on the spot.
Balochistan, in particular, has experienced a sudden spike in terrorist attacks leading up to the elections. Prior to the twin terrorist attacks in Pishin and Killa Saifullah and the shooting incident in Chaman on Wednesday, there were bombings in Sibi and other parts of the province targeting candidates.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has also been on high alert ahead of the polling, with a candidate being assassinated and at least 10 police officials martyred when terrorists stormed a police station in Dera Ismail Khan on February 5.
In response to these incidents, especially the bomb blasts in Balochistan, the authorities swiftly closed the country’s borders with Afghanistan and Iran for one day. The Foreign Office (FO) declared that the closure aimed to ensure ""security during the general elections.
Despite the surge in terrorist attacks, authorities were firm that elections would take place as per schedule on Thursday (today). Caretaker Interior Minister Dr Goher Ejaz expressed his commitment to ensure robust security for elections.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, Ejaz outlined the government’s comprehensive arrangements put in place for the elections. He highlighted the presence of trained commandos in Balochistan and the support of the armed forces for the electoral process.
“Security will be deployed in three tiers, with 7 to 8 law-enforcers stationed at each polling station,” Ejaz said. In Balochistan, the interior minister highlighted the disruptive actions of terrorists tarnishing Pakistan’s image.

3,Amnesty ‘alarmed’ by pre-polls unrest in Pakistan,Body slams targeted violence as a blatant infringement on democratic process,"Amnesty International on Wednesday voiced profound apprehensions over the escalating violence targeting election candidates as well as political entities in the country, particularly in the provinces of Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
With the general elections scheduled for Thursday (today), the human rights organisation in a statement highlighted a series of lethal incidents that had unfolded in recent days, painting a grim picture of the security landscape leading up to the polls.
It pointed out that the most recent attacks occurred in Balochistan, where two separate assaults on election offices on Wednesday resulted in the tragic loss of at least 24 lives.
These incidents are not isolated, as the past 30 days have witnessed numerous attacks, including the ones on January 10 and 31, 2024, claiming the lives of two election candidates, the statement observed.
Amnesty International condemned the targeted violence as a blatant infringement on the democratic process and a severe violation of human rights.
The human rights organisation’s concerns extend beyond the immediate acts of violence. As Pakistan braces for its general election on Thursday, Amnesty International pointed to a range of issues contributing to a worrisome pre-election environment.
🇵🇰 PAKISTAN: Amnesty International is deeply alarmed by the lethal and targeted violence on offices, residences and election convoys of election candidates and political parties, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

It noted that selective bans on protests and gatherings as well as harassment, arbitrary arrests and detentions of party activists and candidates had been reported.
Additionally, it added that media restrictions; internet and social media disruptions; and trials of political opponents with insufficient due process rights raised serious alarm.

Amnesty International called on the caretaker government to take immediate actions to ensure compliance with human rights obligations during and after the elections.
It outlined five recommendations for the Pakistani authorities.
The first recommendation is that the caretaker government should guarantee uninterrupted access to the internet to allow for free flow of information and communication.
In its second recommendation, Amnesty International has urged the authorities to lift restrictions on media to enable transparent reporting and coverage of the electoral process.
In the third, it has asked the authorities to lift all restrictions on assembly and protest to facilitate democratic expression as well as peaceful demonstrations.
Amnesty International, in its fourth recommendation, urged the authorities to grant political opponents access to a fair trial and due process rights -- in accordance with the country’s international human rights obligations.
In the fifth, the human rights body recommended conducting thorough investigations into targeted attacks on political activists and candidates, ensuring that suspected perpetrators were held accountable through fair trials without resorting to the death penalty.
Amnesty International underscored the importance of upholding human rights principles in the electoral process. It emphasised that a free, fair, and secure election was crucial for the democratic future of Pakistan.
The organisation urged the caretaker government to take swift and effective measures to address these concerns and safeguard the democratic values of the nation.
