0,Arrangements made for $3.7bn debt repayment: ministry,"Dar says Pakistan confident that with the support of China, it would not only become a growing economy of the region but the world.","ISLAMABAD: Amid continuous delays to the staff-level agreement with International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government on Tuesday said arrangements had been made to meet external obligations of $3.7 billion by end-June.
In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said $3.7bn had to be repaid during the remaining period of the current fiscal year ending June 30. “This should not be any cause of concern as arrangements have been made for the rollover/repayment of this debt”, it said, adding that significant inflows were also in the pipeline during this period. The PMLN-led coalition government had averted the default and the economy was now on a course to stability and growth, it added.
This coincided with Chinese charge d’affaires in Islamabad Ms Pang Chunxue who called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar to convey ‘best wishes and greetings’ on behalf of Qin Gang the State Councillor and Foreign Minister of China who visited Islamabad recently. “She guaranteed the continuous support of the Chinese government to the people of Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a separate statement.
Pakistan and the IMF had been facing a deadlock for almost three months now in reaching a staff-level agreement after the two sides concluded negotiations for the completion of the 9th review of the IMF programme on Feb 9. 
Pakistani authorities have since been saying they have met all the pre-conditions and blame the Fund over unfair treatment and changing goalposts while the IMF staff had been attributing delays to confirmation of funding commitments from bilateral lenders.
As a consequence, three final quarterly reviews involving about $2.5bn worth of IMF flows have become uncertain before the programme finally reaches its terminal date of June 30. That would require the beginning of talks for a fresh fund programme at a more crucial stage when Pakistan would be in the election phase and yet require over $6bn in fresh repayments to external creditors in the first half (July-December 2023) of the next fiscal year.
The non-availability of IMF umbrella has also delayed inflows from other multilateral creditors, foreign commercial banks and capital markets even though Saudi Arabia and UAE have reconfirmed their commitments to the IMF for disbursements before the close of the fiscal year. The authorities expect a formal signing of a contract with Saudi Arabia within a couple of days.
Of the remaining $2bn needs, the authorities expect inflows on account of flood-related commitments and a programme loan co-financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank over the next couple of weeks. The Chinese $2bn in SAFE deposits are also expected to be rolled over early next month. Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank in the meanwhile stand at a precarious $4.5bn position.
Mr Dar while talking about the deep-rooted historical bilateral relations commended the Chinese support to Pakistan on multiple fronts and underscored the need to further strengthen economic cooperation in all sectors.
The two sides discussed various avenues, especially available for both countries to enhance the trade volume to unprecedented levels. They also talked about the progress on CPEC projects and programmes in Pakistan, the statement said.
Pang Chunxue appreciated the huge potential of Pakistan in terms of agriculture, industry, IT and services sector as well and assured the finance minister that China would work to bring economic prosperity to the region. 
Mr Dar said Pakistan was confident that with the support of China, it would not only become a growing economy of the region but the world as well soon.

1,Musadik sees diversified  energy future,Kugelman believes there is consensus in Washington that Pakistan getting oil from Russia is different from India’s historic relationship with Russia.,"WASHINGTON: Facing a deep economic crisis, Pakistan has started to buy Russian oil, but the country’s petroleum minister says the future lies in diversified, especially green, energy.
Musadik Malik was visiting the United States for talks with corporations as well as with the government, which has led global efforts to choke off Russia’s oil exports that help fund its invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Malik confirmed that a first order was placed for Russian oil and would arrive within a month in Pakistan, which will then assess how much to import in the future. “Based upon the results, we’ll move forward and see for what part of our portfolio we can use Russian energy,” he told AFP.
Asked if Pakistan will pursue more Russian imports, he said, “If today we get cheaper sources of energy, we’ll go there.”
Pakistan, the world’s fifth most populous country, faces chronic energy shortages and imports 84 per cent of its petroleum products, overwhelmingly from Gulf Arab allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Mr Malik said Pakistan had been fully transparent and that its initial dealings with Moscow were far less than those of other countries — notably China and India, whose enthusiastic buying of Russian oil has cast a shadow over New Delhi’s warming relationship with Washington.
“We have not faced any problems, either with the United States or with any other country,” Mr Malik said. “A whole lot of countries are legitimately getting energy from Russia,” he said.
Pakistan’s share “is a little drop, but it helps”.
Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, said he believed there was a broad consensus in Washington that “this is an opportunistic situation where Pakistan is desperate for cheap oil” and substantively different from India’s historic relationship with Russia.
“My sense is that Islamabad is in such a difficult state that it’s not going to risk antagonising the United States, given Washington’s influence over key international financial institutions that are important to Pakistan right now,” Kugelman said.
Pakistan, fearing the collapse of its economy, has been seeking a new tranche of a bailout from the International Monetary Fund which has demanded lasting reforms including subsidy cuts, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif taking the unpopular step of raising fuel prices.
Minister Malik said he spoke with US companies about buying shale liquefied natural gas, upgrading Pakistani refineries and storage facilities, exploring offshore oil and gas and starting horizontal drilling, a method the country does not yet use.
But Malik said his talks with the United States will also seek support for green energy in line with Pakistan’s goal of generating 30pc of electricity from renewables by 2030, including a plan for widespread solar power on rooftops.
“Strategically, it’s very clear to us that the future of energy security is in green energy,” Mr Malik said.

2,KE’s mounting losses are merely a ‘blip’,"CEO Moonis Alvi says K-Electric’s investors, as well as lenders, continue to fully back Rs484bn investment plan despite losses this year.","KARACHI: K-Electric Ltd CEO Moonis Alvi said on Tuesday the unusually high loss that the vertically integrated power utility recorded in the first nine months of 2022-23 constitutes no more than a “blip” in the long run.
Speaking to economist Ali Khizar on his YouTube channel, Mr Alvi said the company’s lenders, including those from Europe and China, knew in advance about the loss. “The substantial part of this loss was budgeted… We’d told our lenders in advance to expect a loss,” he said.
 


The financial performance of K-Electric took a nosedive in the first three quarters of 2022-23, with a net loss of Rs39.4bn versus a net profit of Rs1.5bn a year ago. The quarterly loss in January-March clocked in at Rs12.3bn, up 6.7 times from the same quarter of the preceding year.
Rumours did the rounds on social media after the latest quarterly result that the loss, unprecedented in recent years, had something to do with the change in the company’s ownership structure last year.
Mr Alvi denied it. K-Electric came out in February with a seven-year plan involving Rs484bn in fresh investments — a recent commitment that Mr Alvi repeatedly cited to support his claim that the mounting losses were not only expected but also accounted for.
“The board that approved that investment plan was the same board that approved this loss. It means the loss was predictable. Our position is that these losses have been caused by factors that are not in our control,” he said. He listed four factors along with the respective rupee figures that contributed to the company’s negative bottom line.
One, the company recorded a decline of 5.8 per cent in the total units available for distribution, also known as “sent-out”. It’s an outcome of deteriorating macroeconomic indicators, he said, as the industry is facing a slowdown and consumption by households has also dropped. This alone has contributed Rs7bn to the loss, he said.
Other major contributors to the negative bottom line were the exchange rate loss (Rs9bn), financing cost owing to rising interest rates (Rs12bn) and the impairment loss amid reduced bill recoveries and rising defaults (Rs9bn-10bn).
Mr Alvi said K-Electric’s investors, as well as lenders, continue to fully back the Rs484bn investment plan despite the losses.
His reassurance is against the backdrop of a British Virgin Islands-registered special purpose entity, by the name of Sage Venture Group Ltd, acquiring a large part of the controlling stake in K-Electric in October 2022.

3,Global stocks slump on eve of US inflation data,London stocks fall into the red as investors return from a long holiday weekend marking the coronation of King Charles III.,"LONDON: Stock markets dropped on Tuesday as investors await key US inflation data and track President Joe Biden’s battle with Republicans over the debt ceiling.
Wall Street indices were down in morning trading, while major European stocks closed flat or in negative territory.
London stocks fell into the red as investors returned from a long holiday weekend marking the coronation of King Charles III.
Traders were waiting for Wednesday’s US inflation data that will shape the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy.
A drop in the inflation reading in recent months has fanned hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon pause its tightening campaign and even begin cutting rates by the end of the year, with the banking crisis reinforcing that view.
“US inflation data... will play a key role in shaping the Fed’s interest rate plans moving forward,” said Nigel Green, head of financial advisory firm deVere Group.
After lifting borrowing costs last week, officials hinted at a possible hold at their June meeting.
“We’ve finally reached the point at which the Federal Reserve may be at the end of its tightening cycle and we can start to look forward to when it can feasibly begin to ease policy in order to offset any shock to the economy,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading platform OANDA.
The Bank of England will also announce its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday, with analysts expecting another hike with UK inflation holding stubbornly above 10 per cent.

4,Bank lending to state-run firms jumps to Rs282bn,"Despite a massive hike in tariffs, the power sector companies’ losses continue to rise.","KARACHI: Credit to public sector enterprises (PSEs) soared to Rs282 billion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year compared to just Rs14bn in the same period of last year reflecting the extremely poor financial health of the state-run companies.
Data issued by the State Bank of Pakistan on Tuesday showed the growth of credit to PSEs was abnormally high compared to previous years’ net withdrawal of Rs43bn at the end of FY22 and Rs53bn in FY21.
Bankers said the flow of loans reflects the critical economic conditions of these state-run enterprises. Most of the PSEs were incurring losses for many years and the government keeps them floating with taxpayers’ money.
A senior banker said that the loss-making Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) accounted for the lion’s share in overall bank lending to PSEs. The national carrier has been incurring losses for the last more than a decade but the Covid-19 and skyrocketing oil prices have further deteriorated its financial health.
However, the banker did not disclose the amount borrowed by the PIA during July-April FY23 but said power sector companies were also borrowing heavily due to losses.
Despite a massive hike in tariffs, the power sector companies’ losses continued rising mainly because these companies failed to receive the due amounts from their jurisdictions.
Amid rising circular debt, the power sector distribution companies have been borrowing extensively, said the banker. The last figure available about the circular debt was Rs2.67 trillion during the first 8 months of the current fiscal year.
The total circular debt at the beginning of the fiscal year was Rs2.253tr which increased by Rs419bn. 
The increasing circular debt is creating another serious problem like the current account deficit while many Chinese power companies have been asking the government to pay their dues.
Almost all past governments during the last 20 years did not give due attention to reviving loss-making PSEs. The PDM government has not attempted to resolve this issue despite facing a serious shortage of liquidity.
The prime concern is that these loss-making public companies have over 45,000 employees and for obvious reasons, no government affords to stop feeding them with taxpayers’ money to avoid political noise.

5,China exports rise at a slower pace in April,"Beijing’s exports to Russia leap 67.2pc in April, year-on-year, but demand from markets elsewhere shrinks.","BEIJING: China’s exports grew at a slower pace in April compared to the previous month, according to official data released Tuesday, as the world’s second-largest economy endures a patchy recovery from tough Covid curbs.
Rising global inflation, the threat of recession elsewhere and geopolitical tensions with the United States have weakened demand for Chinese products.
Exports growth cooled to 8.5 per cent in April in US dollar terms, after a surprise jump of 14.8pc in March, customs data showed.
Beijing’s exports to Russia leapt 67.2pc in April, year-on-year, but demand from markets elsewhere shrank.
China’s exports have grown for two months, snapping a run of five straight declines, when production was disrupted by sweeping lockdowns and delays at ports when China enforced its zero-Covid policy.
The stifling health restrictions were scrapped in December but domestic consumption remains subdued.
Imports fell much more sharply than expected in April, sliding 7.9 percent year-on-year, compared with a 1.4 percent decline in March. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected imports to decline by 0.2 percent.
“The contraction of imports may be partly driven by the slowdown of global demand, which in turn affects China’s imports of parts and components,” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

6,‘Inter-corporate dividends be declared non-taxable’,"PBC delegation meets SAPM Tariq Pasha, Minister of State for Revenue Ashfaq Tola and others to discuss budget proposals for 2023-24.","KARACHI: The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has demanded that the payment of inter-corporate dividends be treated as a non-taxable event.
A press release said on Tuesday a PBC delegation met Special Assistance to the Prime Minister Tariq Pasha, Minister of State for Revenue Ashfaq Tola and others to discuss the budget proposals for 2023-24.
Other demands put forward by the PBC included restoring group-loss relief to promote consolidation, scale and competitiveness, creating parity in taxation of gains on the disposal for shares in non-listed and private companies with gains on the sale of real estate, offsetting any tax due with assessed refunds, extending the period available for the offsetting of minimum tax against future profits for a period of five years, reducing the incidence of withholding taxes and advance taxes on the formal sector while increasing the same on non-filers dealing in property and on their utility bills.
The PBC delegation was pointed out that there was a potential of raising tax revenue from wholesale, retail and real estate of Rs747 billion, stemming losses of Rs488bn in revenue from under-invoicing of imports from just four countries, raising property taxes of Rs400bn and agriculture taxes of Rs375bn.
