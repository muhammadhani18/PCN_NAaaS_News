According to a communique of the British Council, the decision to cancel “all exams” including O and A level was made “after carefully evaluating the situation and to ensure the safety of our candidates, their parents and staff members in the event of any untoward incident”.
Besides O and A level exams, the IELTS English language test and exams of the University of London have also been cancelled.
A spokesperson for the Cambridge International said that they simply had to cancel the exams in Pakistan as this was a global exam.  
“Basically, we have an option for missing an exam for genuine reasons. Such students get marks on the missed paper on the basis of the other exam of the same subject. The other exams of the same subject have already been held so the students will get marks based on those papers,” the spokesperson explained about O and A level exam cancellation.  
Regarding the papers scheduled for the day after tomorrow, the Cambridge official said that they would decide about them after watching the situation in Pakistan.
“We will decide whether to cancel or go ahead with any exam on a day-to-day basis,” the spokesperson added.
However, all the educational boards in Sindh have decided to hold matric exams scheduled for Wednesday.

KARACHI: Within a few hours after the arrest of PTI chairman Imran Khan in Islamabad, violent protests erupted in Karachi and parts of Sindh as suspension of internet, cable TV and mobile phone services stoked panic, confusion and fear among citizens on Tuesday.
In Karachi, the PTI staged protest demonstrations near Hasan Square,  Sohrab Goth and Defence Mor areas. However, the PTI leadership  asked workers to reach Insaf House, the party headquarters, on Sharea Faisal which later became a battlefield.
A sense of uneasy calm prevailed across the metropolis. The daily life came to a complete halt near the neighbourhoods along the Sharea Faisal.
Traffic turned thin on city roads as the news of Imran Khan’s arrest spread like a wildfire. The suspension of internet services in many areas further deepened a sense of fear and confusion in residents. Those who had access to the internet through different means were unable to access social media platforms which faced “temporary suspension by the federal authorities”.
Residents of many areas complained suspension of television cable services in their areas as some were facing seizure of cellular service as well.
Unexplained shutdown by authorities and speculations from different circles fuelled anxiety and confusion among Karachiites which were left with little option to find out happenings of the day.
While the British Council cancelled its O and A level exams scheduled for Wednesday (today), the matric boards across the province decided to take annual Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams as per schedule.
The battleground
Sharea Faisal became the flashpoint where a large number of PTI workers and supporters took over the thoroughfare to vent their anger on the arrest of their leader in Islamabad.
On the key thoroughfare, the protesters met with heavy contingents of police and personnel of law enforcement agencies which resorted to baton charge and intense teargas shelling to disperse the protesters.
The authorities also took into custody senior PTI leaders in the city which sparked furthers protests.
Arson attacks and stone pelting left a dozen of vehicles damaged while two checkposts each of Karachi police and Pakistan Rangers were burnt and a number of public and private properties were damaged.
It all began in the second half of day when the local party leadership using social media platforms and other communication modes summoned party workers and supporters to reach the PTI headquarters called Insaf House on Sharea Faisal near the Nursery bus stop.
Within no time, a large number of PTI workers, including women, were found on main Sharea Faisal.
The police resorted to tear gas shelling when the protest turned violent.
Several roads were blocked in other parts of the metropolis, triggering traffic problems, according to officials and witnesses.
However, the party claimed it was a peaceful protest, but the police ‘provoked’ the calm activists.
“We were peaceful and calm,” said PTI MPA and deputy information secretary of Sindh chapter Shahzad Qureshi.
“We only stopped traffic for a while to register the protest. After that we only held a march along the road without disturbing the traffic but from nowhere the police resorted to teargas shelling leaving scores of our workers injured and unconscious. It’s nothing but fascism.”
But before the police moved in, a prison van, a water tanker and suction and jetting machine of Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) and some 10 motorbikes parked along the service lane near Baloch Colony and most probably owned by employees of different companies having offices in the building off the road were set on fire.
In the same area, two unmanned check posts of Karachi police and Pakistan Rangers, Sindh met the same fate.
The shelling was so intense from the police that it forced hundreds of people working in the buildings along the main Sharea Faisal to evacuate their workplaces in panic leaving a scene of chaos and mess.
There was no word from the police about the number of injured due to shelling. The PTI claimed over 50 workers were injured and sent to hospitals for first aid and treatment.
Police on the other hand justified the action blaming the “conduct of PTI leaders and workers” as reason behind the use of force.
“Several PTI workers attempted to go into the Red Zone to protest at sensitive installations near FTC Flyover, when contingents of police prevented them from going further. The workers attacked the police with stones that left three of our officers injured,” South-SSP Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
In the meantime, a bus of the People’s Bus Service was intercepted near Laal Khothi and ransacked after the staff and passengers were asked to get off the bus.
Trees, billboards, plants and greenbelt were also damaged in the turmoil.
Amid all this, the police picked and detained PTI workers from isolated spots of the protest. The authorities confirmed arrest of more than 20 PTI workers from Sharea Faisal.
“We have arrested 23 PTI workers for being active in violence,” said SSP Raza.
The claim was rejected by the party saying over a hundred workers were missing and they all were believed to be picked up by police.
The face-off between the two sides were on when the news of arrest of key PTI leaders reached the protesters through different social media platforms before internet services were suspended minutes before the sunset.
Although the authorities stayed tight-lipped about the arrest of senior PTI leaders, a police source confirmed that former federal minister and Sindh chapter president of the party Ali Zaidi was “taken away by the law-enforcement agency” near Kala Pul in Defence when he was moving to join the Shahra e Faisal protest.
The detention of Mr Ali Zaidi followed the arrest of PTI MPA Adeel Ahmed. The party spokesman claimed that Mr. Ahmed was arrested in Korangi when he was leading a convoy to join the protest on Sharea Faisal.
However, their advancement came to a stop near FTC Bridge.
With reinforcements of police and deployment of heavy contingents of law-enforcers, the police resorted to fresh baton charge and teargas shelling forcing the marchers to retreat.

2,PTI stages walkout after pro-CJP demo in Sindh Assembly,"“What steps do you want from the chief justice,” Sharjeel Memon asks PTI.","KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Tuesday witnessed ruckus as lawmakers belonging to the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf boycotted the proceeding after holding a demonstration to show ‘solidarity’ with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial.
Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari adjourned the session for 10 minutes when the PTI members refused to go back to their seats and kept on chanting slogans Chief Justice Qadam Barhao, Hum Tumhare Sath Hain (Step forward Chief Justice, we are with you) and Aain Bachao Mulk Bachao (Save constitution, save the country).
The pro-CJP demonstration in the assembly led to a strong reaction by the treasury members who held the PTI responsible for spreading anarchy in the country.
The situation took an unpleasant turn when the PTI lawmakers, carrying placards inscribed with different slogans, gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum chanting slogans in favour of the CJP with MPA Rabistan Khan filming the demonstration on his cell phone immediately after Question Hour.
The chair repeatedly asked the PTI members to go back to their seats, but to no avail. “It has been five years since they [PTI members] became MPAs but they have not learnt anything relating to rules and procedures of the assembly,” she snapped.
A visibly irked deputy speaker also warned Rabistan Khan of the PTI from making footage in the assembly. “Use of mobile phone is not allowed on the floor,” she told the PTI lawmaker.
She then put off the proceedings for 10 minutes and left the house. However, she returned to take the chair after three minutes as by that time the demonstrating PTI workers had boycotted the proceedings and did not come back.
Information Minister Sharjeel Memon came down heavily on the PTI members for holding demonstration in favour of the CJP. 
“What steps do you want from the chief justice,” he asked and added that the opposition party wanted the CJP to do what former CJP Saqib Nisar had done.

5,Centre’s permission sought for use of flare gas to overcome energy crisis,"Sindh govt sets up women complaint cells in 23 districts, Shehla Raza tells PA","KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Tuesday through a unanimous resolution asked the federal government to allow use of flare gas for the industrial and transport sectors in the province to overcome the energy crisis.
Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) MPA Nand Kumar Goklani moved the resolution for the use of flare gas, which is defined as any flammable hydrocarbon gas which is disposed of by venting, flaring or safe burning, irrespective of pressure and heating values.
The resolution said: “There are many wells of flare gas/marginal/low pressure gas fields in the province. The production of such wells is not utilised properly, which cause harm to the environment and health of the masses. Sindh is already facing shortage of gas and energy.”
It said that the provincial assembly had already passed a resolution No. 739, moved by Nand Kumar in this regard on Feb 15, 2022. “This assembly resolves and recommends to the provincial government to approach the federal government to use the flare gas/ marginal gas/ low pressure gas for the industrial sector and CNG for the transport sector in the province of Sindh to avoid gas shortage and to generate revenue via virtual pipeline/CNG transport vehicles,” the resolution said.

Sindh govt sets up women complaint cells in 23 districts, Shehla Raza tells PA

Moreover, it said, the existing CNG stations should be permitted to switch to foregoing sources of gas from the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) to other available sources subjected to adherence to all safety protocol as per law.
Supporting the resolution, Parliamentary Affair Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that a few things should be ascertained before demanding the use of flare gas. He said that the SSGC should conduct the thorough research to check its environmental impact.
The parliamentary party leader of the Muttahida Quami Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Rana Ansar, also moved a resolution for establishing small dams in the province. However, she withdrew her resolution after the statement of Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro.
The irrigation minister informed the house that as many as 106 small recharged dams had so far been established by the government, adding that the work on 24 others was under way.

6,Notices issued on plea for demolition of Askari Park shops,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has put the Karachi Metropolitan Corpora­tion (KMC) and other respondents on...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has put the Karachi Metropolitan Corpora­tion (KMC) and other respondents on notice for not demolishing shops on the premises of erstwhile Askari Park, now renamed as Kashmir Park, despite the order of the apex court.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi also issued pre-admission notice to the advocate general  with direction to file comments till May 17.
A non-governmental organisation petitioned the SHC and submitted that the land of the park belonged to the KMC and an agreement for its adoption was made between the then city district government Karachi and the military authorities in 2005 for the development and maintenance of the park.
The lawyer for the petitioner argued that in December 2021, the Supreme Court had directed the Corps V to hand over the park to the KMC and also ordered removal of 88 shops built on the land of the park, other commercial activities and restoration of park.
Therefore, the military authorities had handed over the park to the KMC in February last year and the KMC renamed it as Kashmir Park, he maintained.
However, the counsel contended that such shops had neither been handed over to the KMC nor demolished and on the contrary, those had been allotted to third parties.
“Let pre-admission notice be issued to the respondents as well as AG Sindh, to be served through first three modes, for 17.05.2023, when reply/comments, if any, shall be filed before the next date of hearing with an advance copy to the learned counsel for petitioner,” the bench in its order said.

9,Lawyers’ sit-in causes night-long gridlock on Hyderabad bypass,Protesters get FIR against police team and revenue officials registered as per court order,"HYDERABAD: Lawyers blocked the Hyderabad bypass leading to motorway on Monday night over reluctance shown by police to register an FIR against a police team as per a court order. 
The FIR they wanted to lodge pertained to alleged excesses by three 
SHOs, Latifabad mukhtiarkar and some other persons. The court had ordered dispossession of a health department official from the premises of a bungalow in the GOR Colony. 
The lawyers held a sit-in on the bypass in the evening and did not clear the road until dawn, when the police finally registered the FIR.
The blockade caused hours-long traffic gridlock on the road that leads to the nearby section of Karachi-Hyderabad (M9) motorway. 

Protesters get FIR against police team and revenue officials registered as per court order

They were protesting against dispossession of Dr Kaleemullah Shaikh, a health department officer, his brother and deputy district attorney Saleemullah Shaikh from their house in the GOR Colony on April 27 under administration’s order.
The police team, along with revenue officials, had got the government-owned residential premises of a bungalow vacated. According to lawyers, the officials manhandled Saleemullah Sheikh, brother of Dr Kaleemullah Sheikh. The two brothers are cousins of Asif Shaikh, vice president of the High Court Bar Association (HCBA), Hyderabad.
Lawyers had earlier moved the sessions court against the administration’s order and allowed applicant Saleemullah Sheikh to lodge an FIR against the police and revenue officials under 22-A of the CrPC if a cognisable offence was made out. 
However, the GOR police on Monday declined to register the FIR as per the applicant’s statement which made a large number of lawyers to hold a demonstration outside the GOR police station. Later, they proceeded to Thandi Sarak and held another demonstration. In the evening, the protesters assembled on Hyderabad bypass and held a sit-in, which caused blockade of the road and traffic gridlock and continued till dawn on Tuesday.
According to Saleemullah Sheikh, the residence in question was allotted to his brother, Dr Kaleemullah Sheikh, under a high court order some 10 years back. He said that a few weeks back, the Hyderabad commissioner cancelled the allotment after which the residence was allotted to a BS-16 official of Jamshoro District Accounts Office. He argued that the official who allotted the premises was not from Hyderabad district.
He claimed that the police and revenue officials resorted to highhandedness in the process of dispossession. The police refused to register his FIR despite court’s order. He said that he then filed a contempt plea on Monday against the policemen for non-compliance of Saturday’s court order still the FIR was not registered. 
He said that it was lodged only after Monday night’s protest against SHOs Malik Javed, Mitharo Zardari and Nisar Shah; mukhtiarkar Latifabad Muj­eeb­ur Rehman, the assistant mukhtiarkar, tapedar and others.
