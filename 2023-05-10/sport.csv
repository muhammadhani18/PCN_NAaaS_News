LAGO LACENO: AG2R Citroen rider Aurelien Paret-Peintre dug deep and launched a late attack to win stage four of the Giro d’Italia on Tuesday, while Andreas Leknessund seized the leader’s maglia rosa jersey from Remco Evenepoel. 
After an action-packed start to the stage, a seven-man group engineered a breakaway at the 79-km mark and gradually built a lead which was over five minutes at one point of the 175-km ride from Venosa to Lago Laceno. 
The duo of France’s Paret-Peintre and Lekne­ssund (Team DSM) opened up a gap on the group on a steep climb close to the ski resort Lago Laceno for the Norwegian to take the fabled pink jersey held overnight by race favourite Remco Evenepoel. 
While Evenepoel took pink on day one in a time-trial along the Adriatic coastline, Leknessund, a former Norwegian time-trial champion, trailed him by 1min 18sec and is the new leader due to that effort combined with Tuesday’s escape. 
Evenepoel suffered a late puncture as the peloton rolled through heavy rain into the mountains of the Lucanian Apennines, which his team dealt with swiftly. 
The Belgian also had an early scare when his key rival Primoz Roglic joined a failed escape whilst the Quick Step star was stuck at the back. 
Wednesday’s stage five is a 171-km ride from Atripalda to Salerno, featuring numerous climbs before a flat finish on the Amalfi coast where a mass sprint is expected.

1,Billings warns of skin cancer danger after scare,The 31-year-old says his melanoma was caught just in time and that he almost missed the screening to attend a meeting.,"LONDON: Skin cancer prevention should be a priority for cricketers and fans spending hours under the sun, England wicket-keeper Sam Billings has warned after suffering a scare last year.
Billings underwent two operations last year to remove a malignant melanoma on his chest following a routine screening organised by his county Kent.
The 31-year-old said his melanoma was caught just in time and that he almost missed the screening to attend a meeting.
“I had a melanoma that was 0.6mm [deep]. The threshold of when it gets really serious is 0.7mm, so really close,” Billings told the Daily Telegraph.
“If I had left that screening to go to the meeting, and waited until my next one six months down the line it could have been far, far more serious.”
While searing heat and sunshine are regularly seen in Asia and Australia, Billings says conditions in Britain can be just as dangerous and that English players can be complacent.
“I’m not just talking about the pro game. It’s club cricketers, people who watch the game,” he said.
“I played at Lord’s recently and the sun was out, even if it wasn’t 25 degrees. It might only have been 18 but you can still get sunburnt. We treat it [applying suncream] like a bit of a chore, because the education around it isn’t as good as in countries like Australia.
“I’d like to see everyone in cricket working together: the sun is out, so let’s protect ourselves.”

LONDON: Everton and Nottingham Forest gave themselves renewed hope of survival as the Premier League relegation dog-fight witnessed an extraordinary goal-rush on Monday. 
Everton ended a 13-match run without an away league victory with a stunning 5-1 win at Brighton and Hove Albion to move out of the relegation zone with three games remaining. 
Nottingham Forest then sent Southampton to the brink of relegation with a thrilling 4-3 win at the City Ground that also lifted the two-time European champions out of the bottom three. 
Leicester City were the big losers as a 5-3 hammering at Fulham meant they ended the day third from bottom and with games against Liverpool and Newcastle United next they are now in grave danger of sliding out of the top flight. 
The 21 goals that hit the net on a manic Bank Holiday Monday was the most ever on a day of three Premier League games. 
Brighton are in the hunt to qualify for Europe for the first time in the club’s history, but a heavy schedule appeared to have taken its toll on Roberto De Zerbi’s men as they were torn apart by an Everton side that had not won away since October. 
The Toffees had the dream start as Abdoulaye Doucoure opened the scoring after just 34 seconds. 
Doucoure’s brilliant volley from Dwight McNeil’s cross doubled Everton’s lead before Brighton goalkeeper Jason Steele deflected McNeil’s cross into his own net. 
De Zerbi responded by making four half-time substitutions and Brighton peppered the Everton goal but were caught out on the counter-attack when McNeil showed great poise to round Steele to make it 4-0. 
Alexis Mac Allister pulled a goal back after Kaoru Mitoma’s initial effort came off the post but McNeilhad the final say as he rounded off a dazzling performance by smashing into the top corner in stoppage time. 
A first win in eight games lifts Sean Dyche’s men to 32 points, two more than 18th-placed Leicester and Leeds United. 
“It’s a quality of performance that we want to build,” Dyche said.  “It shows it is in there - it’s the consistency I’ve been searching for.” 
Brighton remain in seventh, two points behind Tottenham Hotspur with two games in hand, but their outside shot at a top-four finish appears gone. 
Forest began the day in the bottom three and knew only a win against Southampton would do. 
Steve Cooper’s side went 2-0 up with a brace by Taiwo Awoniyi’s before Carlos Alcaraz pulled a goal back. 
Morgan Gibbs-White’s penalty just before halftime restored Forest’s two-goal cushion but Lyanco’s header gave Southampton renewed hope early in the second half. 
Gibbs-White’s sublime flick allowed Danilo to make it 4-2 but Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse’s stoppage-time penalty ratcheted up the tension. 
The final whistle was greeted by a huge roar of relief as Forest moved up to 16th place with 33 points. 
“It was a very important win and now’s not the time to pick the bones out of it,” Forest boss Cooper said. “It was always going to be a rollercoaster on a night like this but we stuck together.” 
Forest are away at Chelsea next while Southampton (24 poi­nts) will be relegated if they do not win at home against Fulham next weekend.

The 34th edition of the national gala is scheduled to be held in Quetta later this month.
Though officially the Games are to be held from May 22-30, the team events in Quetta start on Thursday.
Therefore, the PbOA on Tuesday sent some teams including women’s hockey, baseball and volleyball teams.
Every player will get Rs1,500 as daily allowance.
“The cheque amounting to Rs20 million has been received from the Sports Board Punjab and deposited in the bank,” PbOA secretary Idris Haider Khawaja said.
“The sending of our athletes to Quetta has started after some players of the team events left today [Tuesday].”
According to Idris, due to late payment of the grant, the athletes’ preparations were hit badly. “But the athletes will give their best to earn medals,” he said.

4,Sampdoria relegated after loss at Udinese,ROME: Sampdoria will play in Serie B next season after a 2-0 loss at Udinese on Monday sealed their relegation with...,"ROME: Sampdoria will play in Serie B next season after a 2-0 loss at Udinese on Monday sealed their relegation with four games remaining in the season. 
Sampdoria are bottom of Serie A on 17 points, 13 points off 17th-placed Hellas Verona who won 1-0 at Lecce on Sunday. 
Roberto Pereyra and Adam Masina scored in the first half for Udinese as Sampdoria fell to their 23rd defeat of the season. 
Pereyra put the hosts ahead after nine minutes running onto a pass by Festy Ebosele and clipping the ball over the diving Nicola Ravaglia before Masina scored the second with a header from the penalty spot after 34 minutes. 
“I feel enormous disappointment and sadness. We tried and we gave everything we had,” Sampdoria manager Dejan Stankovic told DAZN. 
“I know that every fan does not want to accept this day, but we fought on the field and they were by our side always. This club deserves more, because it is beautiful inside and out.” 
Marco Giampaolo was sacked as manager at the start of October, following a disappointing run of two points from their first eight games and the team’s fortunes 
failed to improve following Stankovic’s appointment. 
“I tried my best and it was not enough. I am very disappointed and cannot find the words for how I feel right now.” 
Sampdoria, who won the Scudetto in 1991 and have clinched the Coppa Italia four times, dropped out of Serie A after 11 years following a disastrous season, on and off the field. 
Things could grow worse for the Genoese club as they face possible further relegations because of financial problems. 
The club has struggled to pay its bills and only avoided a points deduction by convincing the players to give up December’s salaries. 
Massimo Ferrero, who had to resign he presidency in December 2021 after being arrested in a case of fraudulent bankruptcy but remained the club owner, might be ready to sell, Italian media have reported. The 71-year-old film producer has owned Sampdoria since 2014. 
In February, a box with a pig’s head was left at the club’s headquarters with a threatening message for Ferrero and vice-chairman Antonio Romei. 
Sampdoria’s rival and co-tenant at the Luigi Ferraris Stadium, Genoa secured promotion back to the Italian top flight on Saturday 
Meanwhile, Empoli held their nerve to beat Salernitana 2-1 to pull away from the relegation zone. 
Empoli pulled 11 points clear of danger and leapfrogged the team they beat, Salernitana. 
Nicolo Cambiaghi put them ahead with a diving header after 37 minutes before Francesco Caputo added a second in the 63rd minute. 
Substitute Krzysztof Piatek pounced on a rebound in the 86th minute to give the visitors hope but the nearest either team came to scoring in the dying minutes was a ferocious strike by Empoli’s Marco Pjaca, disallowed after a video review because team-mate Razvan Marin was offside.

5,Messi’s father dismisses Saudi links,"“There is absolutely nothing with any club for next year,"" says Jorge Messi.","PARIS: Lionel Messi has not “signed or agreed” a deal to play in Saudi Arabia next season, the Argentine’s father and agent said after reports on Tuesday linked the Paris St Germain forward with a move to the Middle East.
Messi’s future at PSG has been the subject of much speculation in recent days after the Ligue 1 side suspended him for making a trip to Saudi Arabia, where he is a tourism ambassador, and missing a training session as a result.
The Argentina captain is out of contract with PSG in June and an anonymous source close to negotiations told AFP that it was “a done deal” that he would follow former Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo to the Saudi league, adding that the 35-year-old was in the process of finalising details before signing a contract.
However Jorge Messi said his son would only make a decision over his future at the end of the season.
“There is absolutely nothing with any club for next year. The decision will never be made before Lionel finishes the league [season] with PSG,” Messi’s father Jorge said in a statement on Instagram.
“Once the season is over, it will be time to analyse and see what’s out there and then make a decision. There are always rumours and many use Lionel’s name to gain notoriety, but the truth is only one and we can assure you that there is nothing agreed with anyone. Neither verbal, nor signed nor agreed. And there won’t be until the end of the season.”
Messi, who apologised to PSG and his team-mates last week, returned to training on Monday.
A source close to Argentina’s captain told Reuters that he had received a formal offer to join the Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal next season, with a contract renewal at PSG not on the cards for the World Cup winner, who turns 36 next month.
The oil-rich nation appointed Messi its tourism ambassador last year and he visited Jeddah in May 2022.
He returned in January to play a friendly match with PSG against a team of Saudi League stars, when he faced his great rival Ronaldo.
Ronaldo joined Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr in January on a massive deal until 2025, said to total more than 400 million euros ($439 million).
Former Barcelona striker Messi joined PSG in 2021 but is under fire from supporters after the club were eliminated from the Champions League in the last 16 for a second season running.
The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner led Argentina to World Cup victory in Qatar in December, the crowning glory of his career.

6,Australia should consider moving Warner down the order: Vaughan,"“The one thing with David Warner, I know England fear him,"" says former England skipper.","SYDNEY: Australia should split up the opening pairing of David Warner and Usman Khawaja for the Ashes series as England seam duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad would exploit a left-handed partnership in home conditions, Michael Vaughan said.
Opener Warner has managed just one hun­dred in more than three years in the longest format but was retained for the Wor­ld Test Championship final against India next month and the first two Ashes matches.
Former England captain Vaughan said Australia, who won 4-0 at home in the last Ashes series in 2021-22, should consider having Mitchell Marsh open with Khawaja.
“Why would you want to throw out two left-handers to Broad and Anderson?” Vaughan, who helped England end their 18-year Ashes drought in 2005, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
“... looking at the way that those two bowl at left-handers, particularly in English conditions, why would you give those two great bowlers exactly what they want at the top of the order to get themselves up and running?”
Vaughan added that Marsh’s ability to bowl a few overs made him a good option.
“I would honestly look at someone like Mitchell Marsh to open the batting because it gets him in the team. He’s done all right against England.”
Vaughan said there could still be a place for Warner lower down in the order.
“The one thing with David Warner, I know England fear him, Vaughan said.
“He’s such a good player when the ball that’s not moving. The ball won’t move after 30-odd overs in English conditions. Could they find a place for him at five or six?
“I wouldn’t be against looking at him down in the middle of the order to get him in the team because I think [what] others will want is his kind of tenacity and his mentality and his aggressive way.”  The five-test Ashes series begins at Edgbaston on June 16.

Fakhar smashed centuries in each of the opening two games of Pakistan’s five-match One-day International series against New Zealand. His 180 not out in the second match in Rawalpindi, following 117 in the first, helped Pakistan pull off their second-highest run chase.
“He [Zaman] beat tough competition from Sri Lanka spin wizard Prabath Jayasuriya, and emerging New Zealand batter Mark Chapman,” an ICC news release stated.
Fakhar said he was “truly honoured” to win the award.
“This month has been one of the highlights of my career and it was an amazing feeling to play in front of my own people in Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi,” he was quoted as saying in the ICC news release.
“I really enjoyed scoring back-to-back centuries in Rawalpindi, but my favourite was the 180 not out in the second match. I hope to continue the momentum leading into the World Cup, and make Pakistan fans happy and proud with my performances.”

9,Newcomer Salman rates Pakistan as World Cup favourites,"“I wanted to perform well enough [in the NZ series] to cement my place in the side and get rid of any uncertainties over my future,” says Salman Agha.","KARACHI: Having made the Pakistan One-day International side in September last year, Salman Ali Agha has fitted in like the last missing piece of the puzzle.
The right-handed batter, who isn’t as box office like his other superstar team-mates, has cemented his place in the national team as a specialist number six batter as well as handy off-spinner just in time ahead of the ODI World Cup.
Salman’s success is down to his cleverness as a batter at a position which requires a lot of skill and a demonstration of that was on show during the last two matches of Pakistan’s recent five-match ODI series against New Zealand.
The 29-year-old, who has fought his way through a tough domestic cricket system to Pakistan colours, scored two half-centuries on the trot in the said games and has all but earned a ticket to the 50-over showpiece in India.
“I wanted to perform well enough [in the New Zealand series] to cement my place in the side and get rid of any uncertainties over my future,” Salman told Dawn on Tuesday. “Thankfully, doubts on whether I’ll be make it to the World Cup or not, are not on my mind anymore. Now the focus is only on performance.”
It wouldn’t be unfair to say that the Lahore-born cricketer has been lucky for a few reasons to have earned the Pakistan ODI cap. He is a part of a side that lies third in the format’s rankings and is studded with some of the best players in the world, which has filled Salman with belief over Pakistan’s World Cup prospects.
“On paper, I believe Pakistan are one of the best sides and the favourites to win the World Cup,” he said. “All important areas are covered and all boxes are checked.”
Pakistan, however, would need more match practice ahead of the extravaganza but the uncertainties over their international cricket calendar — with the Asia Cup’s fate still hanging in balance — concern Salman, But he is not letting go of hope.
“We haven’t got many one-dayers to play and I’m sure the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) is trying to arrange a few for us,” he noted. “If the Asia Cup is held it will be a great platform to prepare for the World Cup.”
The new Pakistan management under team director Mickey Arthur and head coach Grant Bradburn has exercised a rotation policy for the players and has made it a point to test the team’s bench strength during the New Zealand ODIs — their only assignment so far.
The move has helped Pakistan identify where they stand ahead of the World Cup and Salman said it has saved the team from potential last-minute confusions
“We haven’t got many one-dayers coming ahead so this was the only series where we had the chance to check our bench strength, he said. “How we tried different combinations and tested the bench strength, it helped us get a fair idea on what kind of combinations we want to go into the Asia Cup and the World Cup with. 
“If any player god forbid gets injured then we will have a replacement ready.”
While Salman has proved his capability with the bat, he provides utility as an off-spin bowler as well and he has a clear idea about his role with the ball.
“I play as the sixth bowler in the team and it’s a role which requires a lot of responsibility,” he observed. “Any of the main bowlers can have a bad day and I try covering it up on such days.
“If two or even one lefty is batting, I try to do well against them. I try to keep my economy rate in check and obviously when you are the sixth bowler, opponent batters try to attack, which increases the chances of getting wickets.”
While thoughts about featuring in the World Cup are unavoidable , Salman said he wanted to focus on what is to come before that. Doing otherwise, he feared, may end up proving counterproductive for him.
“To be very honest, I’m not thinking too much about the World Cup,” he revealed. “Obviously, I have it [World Cup] in the back of the mind  but there’s a lot to look forward to before that. The Asia Cup, if it happens, the Sri Lanka series before that and the Afghanistan series are the challenges I’m more focused on.”

10,Archer doubtful for Ashes after injury ends IPL stint,The Ashes series against Australia begins at Edgbaston on June 16.,"NEW DELHI: England fast bowler Jofra Archer is a doubt for the Ashes after he was ruled out for the remainder of this season’s Indian Premier League (IPL) on Tuesday due to a nagging elbow injury.
Archer spent 17 months on the sidelines following elbow and back injuries before returning to international cricket in January.
The 28-year-old played only five of Mumbai Indians’ 10 matches this season and reportedly underwent a minor operation on his troublesome right elbow last month.
The Ashes series against Australia begins at Edgbaston on June 16.
“The England & Wales Cricket Board can confirm that fast bowler Jofra Archer will return from the Indian Premier League with immediate effect,” the ECB said in a statement.
“Archer has been recovering from right elbow surgery. However, pushing through the discomfort whilst recently playing, hoping it will settle, has proven challenging.
“Therefore, it has been agreed for him to return to the UK for a period of rest and rehabilitation to give him the best opportunity for a full recovery.”
Archer will return home this week and begin his rehab with the ECB medical department and his county team Sussex.
Archer’s England team-mate Chris Jordan will replace him at Mumbai.
“Archer was a key part of our campaign in the first half of this season,” the five-time IPL champions said in a statement.
“We wish him the best and cannot wait to have him back with us, fitter, stronger, quicker, deadlier.”
England will also be concerned about the Barbados-born player’s availability for their 50-overs World Cup title defence in India this year.
Jordan made his IPL debut in 2016 for Royal Challengers Bangalore and has also represented Sunrisers Hyderabad, Punjab Kings, Chennai Super Kings.

11,Milan and Inter brace for decisive CL derby,"MILAN: First came a return to the top of Italian football, now comes a chance to reach the Cham­pions League ...","

MILAN: First came a return to the top of Italian football, now comes a chance to reach the Cham­pions League final. 
The Milan teams are back. 
But only one will get the opportunity to compete for European football’s top prize as Milan gears up for its biggest local derby in a generation. 
Two clashes full of colour, noise and drama await in one of the continent’s football capitals, AC Milan and Inter Milan battling at the San Siro for the chance to take the Italian city’s European trophy tally to 22. 
Milan and Inter are no longer true giants like the other semi-final’s contenders Real Madrid and Manchester City but Wednesday’s first leg and the return the following Tuesday will be unbeatable for atmosphere and played in one of football’s most evocative arenas. 
“It’s not a derby, it’s the derby,” Inter manager Simone Inzaghi told reporters on Tuesday. “We know what it means for us, the club, our fans and myself. But I’m feeling calm beca­use I’ve seen that the boys are very concentrated. 
“Every match is its own story, there will be times when we will be more offensive and times when we will more defensive. Just as we did in the last 16 and quarters we will have to play all together and make sacrifices.” 
Three-time European champions Inter were the last Italian club to lift the trophy, when they won an unprecedented treble of the Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League under Jose Mourinho in 2010. Milan won the last of their seven titles in 2007. 
Since the Milan teams’ last triumphs in Europe there have been slumps on the field and turmoil off it, with both clubs changing ownership several times and coaches even more frequently. 
Inter and Milan have faced each other on two occasions in the knockout stages, with Milan emerging victorious in both previous ties — played in 2003 and 2005. 
However, Inter have been more successful in recent meetings, winning three and drawing two of the seven derbies the teams have played since Inzaghi took over as Inter manager in 2021. Those wins have included 3-0 victories in the Italian Supercup final earlier this year and last year’s Coppa Italia semi-finals.

“We have played many times, I said it before. Seven. We have won, lost, made semi-finals, finals,” Inzaghi said. “We will have to be very good at using our heads when we need to, because there are always unexpected events in such important matches: in the last ones, we have always been good at being lucid.” 
Both team’s seasons hinge of the result of the all-Italian tie, with qualification for next year’s competition far from certain thanks to disappointing league campaigns which left last season’s main Serie A title challengers miles behind newly-crowned champions Napoli. 
Inter, though, come into the match in blistering form and with a previously misfiring attack suddenly banging in the goals left and right. 
Inzaghi’s side have won five on the bounce, scoring 14 times in that run, ten of which have been netted by the forwards, with Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Mart­inez both in a hot streak. 
Milan, who were dethr­oned as Serie A champions last week by Napoli, have had a rough run in the league with only three wins in their last 10 games to slip to fifth — two points behind fourth-placed Inter. 
They are sweating on the fitness of Rafael Leao, who in recent weeks has shown just how important he is to Stefano Pioli’s attack but picked up a thigh injury in the weekend’s win over Lazio. 
Of the eight matches this season which Leao has eith­er missed through inj­ury or not started, Milan have won only one. The Por­t­ugal winger has star­ted every single one of Mil­an’s 10 continental matches and was crucial to their getting past Napoli in the last eight. 
Manager Stefano Pioli said on Tuesday that Milan will make a late call on Leao’s participation, adding that Belgian winger Alexis Saelemaekers was a potential replacement. 
“Today he [Leao] trai­ned, tomorrow I will decide what to do,” Pioli told reporters, adding that he was not stressing over the 23-year-old’s fitness. “I’m going to bed quietly toni­g­ht, anyway in the morning Rafa and the doctor will tell me his condition. If he is well he will be called up, otherwise not. 
“If the test is clean he can play. If it is not clean he cannot play — either from the start or the end. I would have preferred to do it tod­ay, but it was not possible.” 
Inter’s last meeting with Milan in the Champions League semi-finals came 20 years ago in the 2002-03 season, when Milan beat them enroute to a sixth European title. 
Midfielder Federico Dim­­a­rco, a childhood Inter fan, said he was at the San Siro for that tie but insisted revenge was not on his mind. 
“It’s been a long time and we think about the present, about tomorrow, about trying to get a positive result and that’s it,” the 25-year-old told reporters on Tuesday. “I don’t have great memories [of the tie], as an Inter fan. But to think that 20 years ago I was there to see it and today I have the chance to play it is an incredible emotion. We know the importance of match and of the derby, we’ll give it a good go.” 
Milan’s Olivier Giroud won the competition with Chelsea in 2021 and is eyeing another triumph after winning the Serie A title last season. 
“This club is special,” the veteran France striker said on Tuesday. “Last year I couldn’t hope for better than to win the Scudetto first year and in the second year still be in the race for the top four and in a semi-final of the Champions League. We are focused on Inter and we just want to dream.”
