2,Panel formed to probe detention of excise officials by police after altercation,It will submit report to home dept within a week,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has formed a committee to probe the detention of excise officials by the police personnel here on Sunday after heated exchanges.
The home and tribal affairs department notified the constitution of the three-member “fact-finding”panel comprising senior officers of the excise, police departments and home departments.
The committee will present its report to the home department within a week’s time, according to the notification.
It said that after an altercation between excise and police authorities in Peshawar last Sunday, the caretaker chief minister constituted a probe team with additional secretary (security) at the home and tribal affairs department retired captain Sanaullah Khan, commandant of the Frontier Reserves Police Force Qasim Ali Khan and director of the excise and taxation department’s Peshawar region Sufyan Haqqani as its members.

It will submit report to home dept within a week

“The committee will look into all aspects of the incident and come up with recommendations for avoidance of such incidents in future, including standard operating procedures for interaction and coordination between various forces and any other recommendations deemed appropriate,” it said.
The report set a seven days deadline for the committee to produce the report.
Last Sunday, the Chamkani police had detained four excise department personnel on charges of refusing to disclose their identity to the cops from the Northern Bypass.
On other hand, the incident’s report prepared by the city police and obtained by Dawn, said that the city police were on high alert over the threat of a terrorist attack against them and the procurement of around 80 police uniforms by terrorists.
It said that the SHO Chamkani during a routine patrol was informed that men in police uniforms and private individuals were checking vehicles at Northern Bypass, in a non-custom paid vehicle.
The report said that when police quizzing them, the man in civvies fled while others identified as ASI Falak Niaz, Ziaur Rehman, Hidayat and Tahir, all constables, started to fighting with police personnel when the latter asked them why they in civvies were checking vehicles.
It said that the KP Control of Narcotics Substance Act mandated only an officer not below the sub inspector to perform search and seizure and deeming it illegal they were taken to police station.
The report said that while the inquiry was underway many excise department vehicles converged on the Chamkani police station.
It said that while the incident could have been avoided, it had created a “bad taste between two departments at a very crucial time and adverse security situation” and that a departmental action had been initiated against the Chamkani SHO.
However, the report also pointed out the need for streamlining the road checking mechanisms of the excise department.
“Since they adorn usual police uniforms and ranks, there is always a likelihood of mistaken identity,” it said.
The report also said that in this dangerous security situation, there was a need for taking steps to differentiate uniforms of the excise department as the law prescribed five cornered stars for the excise personnel.
It said that the situation warranted action under Section 166(4) of the CrPC read with Police Rules 25-23.
The report said permanent nakabandis were in place at all exit points of the district which were the most appropriate locations for checking by the government department.
“Joint check posts at these locations shall not only enhance cooperation, coordination between various government departments but also relieve the general public from undue inconvenience and harassment,” it said.

4,‘Selection’ of Balakot tehsil presiding officer challenged in PHC,Petitioner claims tehsil chairman made decision in violation of rules,"MANSEHRA: A group of Balakot tehsil council members on Tuesday challenged the ‘selection’ of the presiding officer by the house’s chairman in the Abbottabad Circuit Bench of the Peshawar High Court.
“The council chairman doesn’t have the lawful authority to select the presiding officer, and I have challenged his move in the court on behalf of a group of councillors,” Munir Hussain Lughmani Advocate told a press conference here.
He alleged Balakot tehsil chairman Ibrahim Shah had got selected Liaqat Khassan as the presiding officer in violation of the rules.
Mr Lughmani said a group of tehsil councillors led by Sajid Khan, Mohammad Mahroof Awan and Ishfaq Khan had moved a writ petition in the PHC’s Abbottabad Circuit Bench, pleading the 

Petitioner claims tehsil chairman made decision in violation of rules

election of the presiding officer under the amended Local Government Act, 2022, was the job of the Election Commission of Pakistan and not the tehsil chairman’s. 
He said the Act was amended in 2022, empowering the ECP to hold elections to the post of the presiding officer through balloting.
Mr Lughmani said the ECP had already issued the election schedule earlier this year for appointment of presiding officers in the areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the elections to the local government were held in the second phase. 
He said some councillors had challenged the election schedule in the high court, and the case was still pending.
“By selecting the presiding officer of his choice, the Balakot tehsil chairman has committed a contempt of court as the case is sub-judice,” he said. 
Meanwhile, over 70 male and female councillors of the 90-member Mansehra tehsil council also held a session, nominating Malik Mumtaz as the presiding officer.
On the occasion, Mr Mumtaz said his nomination was a blow to the efforts of council chairman Sheikh Shafi to ‘select’ his blue-eyed person as the presiding officer.
MEETING: Hazara division police chief Tahir Ayub on Tuesday asked the Mansehra district police officer to enhance the security of foreigners working on energy and other development projects in the area.
“I am satisfied with arrangements made for the security of foreigners, but there is always room for improvement,” he told a meeting of police officers here.
District police officer Zahoor Babar Afridi briefed the DIG on the arrest of outlaws and the crackdown on narcotics peddlers in the district.
Later, Mr Ayub addressed a gathering attended by ulema, journalists, lawyers, traders and other segments of society. He sought the participants’ cooperation in arresting outlaws and narcotics smugglers.

5,Families of missing persons take to streets in Swat,"SWAT: Family members, including women and children, of the missing persons staged a demonstration at the Kabal Chowk...","SWAT: Family members, including women and children, of the missing persons staged a demonstration at the Kabal Chowk here on Tuesday, blasting the authorities for neither presenting their dear ones in courts nor setting them free despite orders of the higher judiciary.
Defence of Human Rights and Public Service Trust organised the demonstration.
Addressing the protesters, Aftab Ali Shah, provincial coordinator of the trust, said hundreds of people, who had been picked from different parts of Swat since 2009, were languishing in prisons of Mardan, Kohat, Peshawar and Haripur without any recourse to law. He said the missing persons were placed in different categories, and some of whom had died in custody.
Mr Shah said about 500 of the missing persons were still languishing in prisons despite they had won their cases in courts. He said some missing persons had been in prison for as many as over 15 years.
Family members of the missing persons said the Peshawar High Court had already decided missing persons’ cases in their favour, but they were yet to be released.
“My son was taken into custody by security forces in 2009, and later a military court sentenced him to 10 years in jail, but over 15 years have passed and my son is not being released. I am an old man, and have to look after my wife and four children,” Farmosh, father of missing person, Anwar Zeb, said. He appealed to the government to take pity on him and order release of his son.
Amir Wahid, another elderly man, said security forces had picked his son, Mohammad Shah Khan, about 16 years ago. Holding a photo of his son, he said: “When he was picked he had a one-year-old daughter, who is now 15 years old.” He said a military court had handed him 10 years imprisonment, and he had already completed his term, but was still in jail.
Several women were also in the protest with some of them holding photos of their missing sons, brothers, husbands and fathers. They appealed to the authorities to ensure their early release.
“Since my husband and son had been taken away, I could not sleep a single night,” an old woman said, adding she had exhausted all options to get them released, but to no avail.
The protesters appealed to the army chief, the Chief Justice of Pakistan, and the prime minister to ensure release of their loved ones without delay.

6,"Dissolution of MTI boards withdrawn, high court told","PHC disposes of pleas challenging govt move against policy board, BoGs","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court was informed on Tuesday that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had withdrawn notifications for the dissolution of the Medical Teaching Institutions Policy Board and board of governors (BoGs) of the institutions in the province.
A bench consisting of Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad disposed of 10 almost identical petitions, which challenged the dissolution of the MTI Policy Board and BoGs after provincial advocate general Aamir Javed informed it about the withdrawal of the relevant notifications.
The AG said that the provincial government had withdrawn notifications for the dissolution of those boards.
He said that after withdrawal of those notifications the grievance of the petitioners had been addressed and these petitions had become infructuous.

PHC disposes of pleas challenging govt move against policy board, BoGs

One of the petitions was filed by four members of the dissolved policy board challenging the termination of their membership by the health department through an impugned notification issued on March 28.
They have also challenged the March 16 caretaker cabinet’s decision to remove them as board members.
A bench of the high court had on April 4 granted an interim relief to the petitioners by suspending that notification to the extent of the four petitioners, including Mohammad Tahir, Dr Zeeshan bin Ishtiaque, retired Major-General Salahuddin Qasim and Prof Ghazala Mahmud.
The other petitions were filed by members of BoGs of different MTIs challenging the March 16 decision of the provincial cabinet to dissolve MTI BoGs.
A bench had on April 12 suspended the decision of the caretaker cabinet to dissolve these boards and had sought replies from the KP chief secretary and Election Commission of Pakistan.
Advocates Shumail Ahmad Butt and Ali Gohar Durrani appeared for the petitioners and said that the government should file its comments and if the provincial caretaker cabinet had withdrawn its decision they should mention the same in those comments.
They said that they won’t be having any objection if the government mentioned the fact that it had withdrawn the notifications in its comments.
The lawyers contended that the role of the current caretaker setup was confined to the running of the day-to-day affairs of the province with the help of the available machinery and that the caretakers couldn’t take policy decisions and “permanent measures” like recruitment, appointments, transfers and postings, and removal of government officials.
They argued that Section 230 of the Elections Act prohibited the caretaker government from making any policy decision in the province and thus its decision was illegal and without lawful authority.
The lawyers contended that a Supreme Court judgement about the powers of the caretaker government should be implemented in line with the spirit of Part VIII of Constitution and Section 230 of the Elections Act, 2017.
They said that the provincial government had enacted the Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act in 2015 to run major teaching hospitals in the province through BoGs.
The counsel said that BoGs of MTIs had several achievements to their credit and it was only natural that the boards would be allowed to complete their tenure.
They, however, said that to their utmost surprise, a summary was moved by the health secretary to remove BoG members.
The lawyers added that the summary for it was placed before the caretaker cabinet, which approved it on March 16.
The bench observed that after withdrawal of the impugned notifications, there was no need for further proceedings on the matter.

7,Batteries of solar streetlights stolen in Swabi,SWABI: Unknown thieves have taken away batteries of solar-powered streetlights in Topi city and Topi-Tarbela Road....,"SWABI: Unknown thieves have taken away batteries of solar-powered streetlights in Topi city and Topi-Tarbela Road.
When contacted, officials in tehsil municipal administration told Dawn that the solar-powered streetlights were installed with the funds provided by former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser.
They said the solar system was installed in 2016 with each streetlight costing Rs140,000. However, they said for want of maintenance, the solar-powered streetlights had been out of order for some time, which provided an opportunity to the thieves to take the batteries away. When contacted, Mohammad Younas, former tehsil naib nazim, claimed that he had protested against the installation of substandard solar streetlights, but Mr Qaiser didn’t take the matter seriously. He said the solar-powered streetlights were of low standard.
Tehsil municipal officer Yasir Khan was repeatedly contacted but he didn’t attend the calls. 
The police officials said the TMA had yet to get an FIR registered about theft of the solar systems’ batteries.
Similar reports were also received from Swabi city, Tordher, Manki and other areas.
Meanwhile, Javid Inqilabi, divisional president of Pakistan Peoples Party, demanded an inquiry into the substandard solar systems.
He told mediapersons that the solar-powered streetlights were installed across the district during the PTI government, but the system had come to a halt. 
Answering a question, he said the people’s money was spent on the solar project, and it was the responsibility of the government to expose those who had committed irregularities and corruption in execution of the project.
