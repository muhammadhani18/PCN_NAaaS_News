2,Plan to arrest Imran by police changed at eleventh hour,"Former PM brought to NAB building in G-6, likely to be shifted to safe place, say police officers.","ISLAMABAD: In a change of plan, Rangers arrested former prime minister Imran Khan from the premises of Islamabad High Court (IHC) even though the task had earlier been given to the capital police, Dawn has learnt.
After the arrest, protests erupted all over Islamabad which resulted in law and order situation and road blockades.
Police officers told Dawn that earlier the quarters concerned had tasked the police with arresting Imran during his appearance in the high court in connection with separate cases.
In response, a plan was chalked out in which it was decided that he would be arrested at the main entrance in connection with a NAB case.
However, the police were later told to take him into custody from inside the court building, the officers said.

Former prime minister brought to NAB building in G-6, likely to be shifted to safe place, say police officers

The senior command agreed with the directions, but the supervisory officers, who were assigned the task of the arrest, opposed saying the police would pay the cost if the arrest was made from inside the premises.
Arrangements were also made to detain Mr Khan either at the Secretariat police station, Counter-Terrorism Department or Criminal Intelligence Agency building, the officers said, adding that the Secretariat police station was the first choice to detain the PTI chief as it was the safest being located inside the Red Zone.
The police and the Frontier Constabulary were deployed in and around the high court and other security measures were also put in place, they said. Besides, a contingent of Rangers was deployed at the court who later took charge of the security measures.
A number of sports utility vehicles (SUVs), including Vigos installed with antennas and jammers, were also brought to the high court and parked on Service Road South G-10/1, the officers said, adding that the teams of Rangers swarmed towards the diary branch when Mr Khan, accompanied by his counsel, and some PTI leaders entered the premises for biometrics.
 
 

The personnel broke the window with batons and asked the staff inside to open the door as it was locked from inside.
Later, they entered the room and arrested Mr Khan, took him towards an SUV and bundled him inside. A number of personnel also embarked on the vehicle and some stood on the footers along the doors.
The vehicle came out of the gate on the Service Road and moved to an undisclosed location. Hours later, he was brought to the NAB building in G-6.
It was being considered to shift the PTI leader to a safe installation instead of keeping him at the NAB building, the officers added.
One of Mr Khan’s guards talking to the media said he was a retired SSG personnel and those who arrested the former prime minister were trained soldiers, not Rangers personnel.
Some of the PTI leaders managed to leave the court premises to avoid arrest, but a few, including Fawad Chaudhry, remained there and went inside a courtroom to avoid arrest.
After the development, PTI workers and activists poured onto different roads and highways in the capital and Srinagar Highway and Islamabad Expressway at different points.
About 250 people gathered at G-9 Chowk and set fire outside the PWD office and damaged a police picket.
Another gathering also blocked G.T. Road at Rawat while over 250 people assembled at Rawat Bazaar and set tyres on fire and chanted slogans against the arrest of their leader.
Moreover, about 230 people blocked G.T. Road at Chungi No 26. The expressway was also blocked at 111 stop by around 300 protesters.
Protests were also held at Faizabad where PTI supporters set tyres on fire and damaged public property, the officers said, adding over 70 protesters were detained from different parts of the capital. They included a PTI lawmaker who was also brought to the Secretariat police station.

Says web portal to eliminate necessity of middlemen, instances of counterfeiting

Besides, the dependence of owners on middlemen and chances of tampering with records during registration would be eliminated.
The DC added that the e-registration system will be linked to Nadra and the e-stamp system.
Responding to a question, he claimed that the initiative of the Punjab government was aimed at bringing transparency to the process and reducing corruption and fraud in property purchase and sale.
Mr Cheema said that under this system citizens will get the challan from the e-stamp web portal and after paying the prescribed fee in Bank of Punjab can complete the paper work at home.
The deputy commissioner said that the initiative was a revolutionary step which would end public visits to revenue 
offices, kutcheries and stamp vendors. 
He said that instead of standing in long queues, the date and time of appointment would be generated through the system and the citizens would get a message about their appointment on their mobile phones.
Responding to a question about digitalisation of land record, Mr Cheema said the land record of tehsils Taxila, Kahuta and Kallar Syedan had been fully digitalised while 90 per cent digitalisation of land record of Gujar Khan was complete.
He said all the revenue records of these tehsils were updated at the land record system of the Punjab Land Record Authority.
Responding another question, the deputy commissioner said Jammabandi (record of rights of land) of 158 mouzas had also been completed in the district.

6,Campaign launched to improve maternal nutrition in Pakistan,ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) and Nutrition International on Tuesday launched a campaign...,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) and Nutrition International on Tuesday launched a campaign to improve maternal nutrition in Pakistan.
The campaign will reach over 5,000 healthcare providers (HCPs) and frontline health workers (FHWs) to enhance their knowledge of maternal nutrition and integrating nutrition counselling in their routine practices. 
The campaign will be held in six selected districts that report poor maternal nutrition indicators. 
“Improving the knowledge and capacity of healthcare providers to address maternal nutrition issues and promote a collective responsibility approach is the need of the hour,” Special Secretary Ministry of NHS Mirza Nasiruddin Mashhood Ahmad said at the launching ceremony. 
Endorsing the Nourish Maa campaign and committing to its effective implementation, Mr Ahmad referenced the Pakistan National Maternal Nutrition Strategy 2022-27, which calls for increasing awareness about maternal nutrition among individuals, families, communities, healthcare providers, policymakers and the public at large. 
According to the National Nutrition Survey 2018, it is estimated that 42pc of Pakistani women of reproductive age (15-49 years) bear the triple burden of malnutrition, with half of all pregnant women being anaemic, and 38pc of them being overweight and obese. Additionally, one in every two (54pc) adolescent girl (10-19 years) is anaemic in the country. 
High rates of malnutrition among WRA and adolescent girls, coupled with underlying complications arising from early marriages, closely spaced pregnancies and maternal malnutrition exacerbate a vicious cycle of high morbidity and mortality, leading to adverse maternal and child health outcomes.
The campaign, developed to support the Pakistan Maternal Nutrition Strategy 2022-27, aims to help address these issues by leveraging the critical role of HCPs and FLWs. 
The key objective of the campaign is to raise awareness about the importance of maternal nutrition and improve the capacities of health workers in public and private sectors, key opinion leaders (KOLs) and other stakeholders to advance maternal nutrition interventions in Pakistan. 
The campaign aims to achieve some specific outcomes, including improved knowledge among HCPs and FHWs, on maternal nutrition, effective engagement of key HCPs on maternal nutrition, and improved knowledge and motivation among KOLs. 
The campaign is being implemented in two districts of Punjab and four districts of Sindh by Nutrition International in collaboration with the health ministry, the provincial departments of health, the Professional Medical Association and the Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecologist Pakistan.During the launch of the campaign, Dr Shabina Raza, Nutrition International Pakistan Country Director, emphasised the critical need for investing in maternal nutrition. 
“The campaign is unique in the sense that it contributes in developing an enabling environment for maternal nutrition and directly works with the health service providers, increasing their knowledge and motivation towards addressing maternal malnutrition”, said Dr Baseer Achakzai, Director General Health.

7,Legal hiccups hit Nilore Heights project,Plea filed in IHC against balloting of CDA-owned apartments,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) Nilore Height Project for overseas Pakistanis has faced a setback because of pending litigation, raising a question mark on the balloting for the project slated for May 16.
The said housing project for overseas Pakistanis received an overwhelming response, as 6,000 applications had been submitted by the expatriates against 2,000 apartments in the first phase of the project.
Initially, the CDA was supposed to hold balloting on May 16, but last week, during a meeting which was chaired by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, it was decided that balloting would be held on Monday (May 8). But it could not be held on Monday due to legal complications.
Sources said balloting would probably not take place on May 16 either and added that the process would be held after cases were disposed of. However, a final decision in this regard has not been made yet.

Plea filed in IHC against balloting of CDA-owned apartments

“We were all set to hold balloting, but it was postponed for the time being. We will plead our cases before the courts. So far, we are sticking to our earlier decision to conduct balloting on May 16. But in light of pending cases, it seems we will have to wait for another few weeks,” said a director of the CDA.
Legal complications
Sources said initially a project was launched by CDA in collaboration with Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (NPHDA) for the working class. Last year, the NPHDA also held balloting for 200 flats for the same purpose.
However, the CDA later decided to take over the entire project and gave it a new name ‘Nilore Height’, claiming it was built by the CDA from its own funds and on its own land.
Sources said that some months ago when the CDA decided to launch this scheme Phase-I exclusively for overseas Pakistani, it received an overwhelming response, as it received 6,000 applications against 2,000 apartments. 
Overall, the CDA has over 4,000 apartments in this scheme.
However, people, who got allotment from NPHDA against flats, filed a number of applications before Federal Ombudsman Office and a petition was also filed before the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday against the proposed sale of apartments to overseas Pakistanis.
The court issued notices to the CDA and other respondents. In light of court cases, the CDA may postpone the balloting as it has directed its law wing to prepare a comprehensive reply to contest the cases filed against the project. “The project is developed on CDA’s land with its money, we have the right to put this project on sale,” said a director of the CDA.
This housing initiative was launched by the civic body on the instructions of the federal government to cater to expatriates in a bid to boost the foreign exchange reserves. A two-bed apartment is being sold by the CDA at a price of $30,000.
Meanwhile, the CDA is also planning to launch two more housing schemes for overseas Pakistanis that include around 100 plots in Sector C-14 and around 700 plots in C-16.
The officials said that special facilitation desks have been established in the CDA to facilitate overseas Pakistanis.
According to an official said, the civic agency was also planning to launch high-end apartment projects in Sector C-13 along Margalla Avenue; however, a final decision in this regard is expected later this month.

RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters in Islamabad and Rawalpindi took to the streets on Tuesday to protest the arrest of party chairman Imran Khan who was detained on the premises of the judicial complex in the federal capital by a contingent of Rangers.
In Rawalpindi, a group of PTI supporters stormed the General Headquarters and managed to break the main gate of the building. The enraged protesters, who were carrying batons, gathered outside the GHQ, smashed a statue and then forced their entry inside the GHQ after breaking its gate. A viral video showed some protesters entering the building and calling others to join them as they moved forward. However, they were pushed back by police personnel before they could move ahead.
Protesters also smashed windowpanes of Hamza Camp (erstwhile Ojhri Camp) and desperately attempted to force their way inside. According to eyewitnesses, gunfire was also heard outside the camp, but it could not be confirmed who fired the shots.
Murree Road, Bank Road, Saddar, Liaquat Bagh and other parts of the city also witnessed violent scenes, leaving two police officials – Waris Khan DSP Tahir Sikandar and Ratta Amral SHO Chaudhry Riaz – injured.
Clashes were also reported at Faizabad, Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh, Iqbal Road, and Fawara Chowk as police fired teargas shells to disperse small groups of protesters. The use of teargas also caused breathing problems for people residing in areas near Murree Road and Saddar.
In the downtown area, routine activity in markets and bazaars was witnessed. Though people bought groceries more than routine to avoid the closure of markets, the traders said that there was no need to panic as the markets and bazaars will be opened as per routine.
“Due to the closure of roads, there is some problem but we closed the shops late at night,” said Rawalpindi Traders Association President Sharjeel Mir.
On the other hand, a police crackdown against protesters was underway, as some arrests were made and FIRs were expected to be registered with the Waris Khan and Ratta Amral police against the PTI supporters. Till the filing of this report, clashes between the police and PTI supporters were ongoing at Committee Chowk and General Post Officer (GPO) in Saddar.
Protests in Islamabad
A number of roads, including the Faizabad intersection, were blocked by PTI supporters. Ali Nawaz Awan and Raja Khurram Nawaz led a group of protesters on the Expressway near Koral and blocked the road.
They alleged that Mr Khan was kidnapped. While protests were being held in different areas of the city, students left educational institutions/universities, and offices were closed early in light of protests.
Mohammad Tahir, while talking toDawn, said that he decided to close his factory in Sector I-10 earlier and directed his workers to reach their homes at the earliest. “I have told them that they should ask me at night or early in the morning whether the factory would open on Wednesday (today),” he said.
The protests in twin cities also resulted in the suspension of the metro bus service.
Metro Bus General Manager Shumaila Mohsin told Dawn that the transit authority suspended the metro operation soon after the reports of the protests. She was unsure about the resumption of bus service today.
Educational activities
Some university students, including the International Islamic University Islamabad, left for their houses early after getting information that the buses may not operate.
The National University of Modern Languages and Pir Mehr Ali Shah-Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi decided to conduct online classes today. However, Fatima Jinnah Women University would remain closed on May 10 as per its notification.
Some private educational institutions announced a holiday for Wednesday, but there were no orders from the government regarding the closure of schools and colleges.
Rawalpindi Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education spokesman Arslan Cheema said that the BISE had postponed the SSC Part-I annual papers. Islamic Education paper was supposed to be held today. 
Similarly, the British Council also postponed all exams scheduled for Wednesday.
The Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE) has also cancelled the Pak Studies exam on Wednesday. 
“We have decided to cancel the paper which was to be held on Wednesday,” FBISE Chairman Qaiser Alam told Dawn.
However, the schools and colleges under the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) will remain open as per routine.
“As for now, this is our decision to keep educational institutions open,” an FDE officer told Dawn.
On the other hand, private school managements are taking decisions of keeping their institutions open or close on an individual basis, with some opting to remain closed on Wednesday.  
In Hazro, the charged protesters led by PTI District President Qazi Ahmed Akbar blocked G.T. Road near Hattian.
Later, they took DSP Jehangir Joya hostage and also subjected him to torture. Protests were also held in Wah, Taxila and Fatehjang. Due to massive protests, traffic remained jammed on various inter-city and inter-district routes causing much inconvenience to the commuters.
Medical team for Imran
Polyclinic on Tuesday constituted a seven-member medical board for the medical examination of the former prime minister Imran Khan.
According to a notification issued by Polyclinic, the board was chaired by Consultant Physician Dr Faridullah Shah and other members are Dr Mamoon Qadir (cardiologist), Dr Muhammad Akhtar Khan (orthopaedic Surgeon), Dr Saima Shah (radiologist), Dr Tassawar Mirza (general surgeon), Dr Imtiaz Ahmed (chief medical officer) and Dr Khadija Iftikhar (pathologist).
