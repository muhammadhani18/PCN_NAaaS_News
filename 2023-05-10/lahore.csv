While sharing details of the accounts and the funds utilised, Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar said under the prevailing system and policies, there had never been any accountability of the secret fund provided by the government to the provincial police. However, he said the current police leadership had not kept “the secret fund secret” and unveiled its utilisation details.
Dr Anwar said all records of the funds used were presented at the Police Executive Board meeting every week. “When I took charge as the Punjab Police Chief, there were Rs38.2 million in the secret fund,” he said.
Out of these funds, he said, Rs800,000 were given for commencing the Katcha Operation Rahim Yar Khan, Rs500,000 to the Lahore SSP investigation for a special project, and Rs518,000 for sensitive installations and the safety of lives and properties of the citizens.
Likewise, Rs1.8m were given to the personnel of the operations and investigations wings. A dangerous gang was eliminated by giving Rs200,000 to the Lahore CIA, he said, adding that Rs1m more was spent on the Katcha Operation. 
After the above expenses, the remaining amount of Rs33m was available in the secret fund account and would be utilised for the operational expenses of wiping out hardened criminals and terrorists.
He said the account of all the money in the secret fund would be presented to the public in the executive board meeting held every week.

LAHORE: Violent clashes broke out between Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and security agencies on Tuesday, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of PTI workers in the province, while several policemen suffered injuries.

In Lahore, PTI workers gathered at Liberty Chowk and started marching towards the Cantonment areas. Announcements were made on social media platforms to reach the Cantonment to protest outside the corps commander’s Jinnah House.
In a footage circulating on different social media platforms, PTI workers were seen carrying clubs and party flags as they arrived at the corps commander’s house in the Cantonment area.

Protests lead to arrest of PTI workers, injuries to police officials; Section 144 imposed

The protesters broke the main gate of the corps commander’s house while chanting slogans against the arrest of their chairman. Video footage circulating on social media showed workers breaking windowpanes, TVs and furniture of the house, and also setting trees and furniture on fire.
In one such video, protesters could also be seen pelting stones and bottles at an army convoy on The Mall. They also set police vehicles outside the Fortress Stadium on fire. They also set several security posts established on different roads in Cantonment on fire. The PTI workers also set Liberty Chowk on fire during the protest.
PTI workers also closed down Akbar Chowk, Peco Road, Main Canal Road, Johar Town, Garhi Shahu, Zaman Park, The Mall, Shimla Pahari, and Faisal Town.  
The demonstrators burnt tyres and chanted slogans against the coalition government.
As many as 30 policemen, including DIG operations Ali Nasir Rizvi, operations SSP Sohaib Ashraf, Cantt SP Awais Shafiq and DSPs, were injured during clashes with PTI workers.
The police also arrested hundreds of PTI workers from different districts of the province. Videos circulating on social media showed that the policemen were taking PTI male and female workers into custody in Lahore and Multan.
In Multan, PTI workers also entered the cantonment area where the police and other law enforcement agencies stopped them by using tear gas. The workers were protesting by blocking major roads of the city.
The videos of Multan Cantonment showed that the army personnel were confronting the protesters and stopping them from entering the cantonment by using tear gas.

A notification issued by the Punjab Home Department said the restriction had been imposed due to protest activities posing “serious security threats”.
It further states “There is also a history of terrorist activities in the rallies/protests, wherein a number of police officials and civilians embraced shahadat. Hence, in the context of the prevailing overall security situation in the wake of the recent wave of terrorism & threat alerts, it has been necessary to impose Section 144 of CrPC 189”.

3,Millers to observe strike daily against ‘flawed’ wheat policy,LAHORE: Flour millers in Punjab decide to observe a symbolic strike on a daily basis in protest against what they ...,"LAHORE: Flour millers in Punjab decide to observe a symbolic strike on a daily basis in protest against what they say ‘flawed’ policies of the food department. 
A press release issued by the Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association here on Tuesday said the symbolic strike would be observed from May 10 to 17 during which all the mills would keep their grinding and supply operations closed between 2pm and 6pm daily. 
It said that the flour milling industry in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was also following suit. 
PFMA chairman Asim Raza demanded that the prime minister and Punjab chief minister take notice of the poor policies of the food department creating hurdles in the operations of the flour mills and causing harassment among the millers. He claimed that unlike in the past they were being prevented from purchasing wheat from market surplus, whereas the district administration was lifting the declared grain stocks lying with the mills. 
He said traditionally the flour milling industry, food department and other agencies had been purchasing wheat side by side during the harvesting season. Though the wheat crop is bumper this year, the industry is being barred from procuring 2.2 million tonnes of grain from the market surplus that would help stabilise the wheat market as well as keep flour prices steady up till the months of September each year. 
He claimed that the food department was imposing ‘undue’ restrictions on wheat buying this season, while the district administration was being forced to seize the already purchased and formally declared grain stocks from the flour mills.  
The government policy, he said, has reduced wheat arrival in the market to the minimum because of which the milling industry is facing difficulties to get the crop for meeting its daily grinding operation, while wheat rates are gradually on the rise and have already reached the level where they should be during the month of September. 
This is also leading to a gradual increase in the flour price to the disadvantage of the consumers, he added.  
He appealed to the Punjab government to remove what he said an unconstitutional ban on inter-district and inter-province movement of wheat, allowing the milling industry to purchase its raw material freely.

4,Court to hear pleas for Imran’s removal as party head,Petitions argue that Imran is violating laws by continuing to hold PTI chairman's office.,"LAHORE: Justice Abid Hussain Chattha of the Lahore High Court on Tuesday decided to hear two petitions seeking removal of former prime minister Imran Khan from the office of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman following his disqualification in Toshakhana reference.
The judge had reserved his verdict on whether the petitions should be referred to a larger bench or heard by the single bench.
Advocate Muhammad Afaq filed the petitions – one in person and the other on behalf of a citizen, Muhammad Junaid.
The lawyer requested Justice Chattah to not hear the petitions and refer the same to the chief justice for fixing the hearing before any other judge. The lawyer was of the view that the judge in the past had contested an election on the ticket of the PTI.
After hearing the arguments of the lawyer, the judge reserved the verdict, which he announced later and ordered the office to fix the petitions before his court on May 19.
The petitions mainly contend that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) disqualified the former prime minister and de-seated him from NA-95, Mianwali, on a corruption charge.
It said the office-bearers of a political party must meet the standards provided in articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution as per the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1976 and the Political Parties Order, 2002.
The petitions argue that Khan is violating the laws by continuing to hold the chairman`s office of the PTI, which was registered with the ECP.
It also refers to the case wherein the Supreme Court restrained former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from heading the PML-N following his disqualification under articles 62 and 63.
The petitions ask the high court to order the ECP to remove Khan as PTI chairman and issue a direction for the nomination of a new party head.

During a press conference held in Lahore, he expressed doubt about the continuation of dialogue among political parties on elections after the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan.  
Haq stated that the anti-inflation movement would start in Lahore on May 21, and JI workers would hold protest demonstrations in Peshawar on May 24. The detailed schedule for countrywide rallies would be issued in the next couple of days, he added.
He demanded that the government announce a Rs100 per liter cut in petrol prices and a 50pc decrease in medicine prices. He also urged the government not to fill top vacancies with retired officers from military or civil bureaucracy, but rather to induct fresh blood to serve the country. Furthermore, he emphasised that the government should cut all non-development expenditures, discourage the VIP protocol culture, and bring back the money stashed in foreign accounts.
The JI chief condemned the violence and torture of party workers during the Karachi by-election for local bodies, holding the PPP responsible for bringing hooligans from outside of Karachi to polling stations.  
He said the Election Commission of Pakistan failed to fulfill its responsibility to hold free and peaceful elections, and he also questioned why those elements who were involved in violence during the polling process had not been arrested. 
He vowed to defend the JI mandate and criticised the PPP for not accepting the people’s mandate. He said such tactics in the past caused the derailment of democracy, leading to irreparable losses for the country.  
Mr Haq thanked the people of Karachi for putting their trust in JI and congratulated the JI team on their success.

A spokesperson for the LGH said the patients have now been back to normal life because artificial bladders have been implanted.
The operations were conducted by LGH urology department head Prof Dr Khizar Hayat Gondal and his team.
Postgraduate Medical Institute/LGH principal Prof. Dr. Muhammad Al-Fareed Zafar declared it extraordinary surgical procedures saying the doctors have accomplished their job in true sense which will be a bright chapter in the history of medical world. He expressed his satisfaction about the performance of professors of the institute.
The PGMI principal urged the young doctors to strive hard to enhance their professional skills under the guidance of their seniors and teachers to achieve the high standards so that they can become excellent doctors as well as successful surgeons.
Prof. Khizr Hayat Gondal told the media that the patients from Jhelum, Toba Tek Singh, Rahim Yar Khan, Lahore and Gujrat visited OPD for check-up and they were admitted for operations.  
He said in the private sector, an operation of this type costs more than Rs1 million whereas in LGH, the facility has been provided free of cost to all patients that is a great relief. He said radical cystectomy surgeries are very complicated and six to eight hours are required for a patient’s surgery. All the operations were successfully done and now these patients are living a normal life.
Prof. Gondal said prostate (gland) and bladder problems are usually complicated at old age as most of the people above 50 years of age develop prostate enlargement and inflammation in the bladder and gland, but in some cases young patients suffer from these problems.
He said in case of blood in urine without pain, patients feel temporary relief by using cold objects which is not a permanent solution, so such patients should contact urologist immediately.
In response to a question, Prof. Khizr Hayat Gondal said had artificial bladders not been implanted, the cancer could have spread throughout the body.  
He said that bladder disease can be controlled by daily exercise and proper diet.

Additionally, the first communication tower at the base camp of K2 was also installed by SCO, along with laying of 820km long Pak-China fibre optic, which is already being quoted as digital silk route.” 
He termed Ruda and SCO the “digital twins” on the road to technological excellence with the prime aim of serving the public.
