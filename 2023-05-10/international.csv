0,Texas mall shooter embraced Nazi ideology,"WASHINGTON: The man accused of killing eight people at a Texas shopping mall recently obtained large Nazi tattoos,...","WASHINGTON: The man accused of killing eight people at a Texas shopping mall recently obtained large Nazi tattoos, praised other mass shooters and wrote just ahead of his attack that he would “fight hate with more hate.” Mauricio Garcia, the 33-year-old who police say opened fire with an assault rifle on shoppers at the Allen Premium Outlets mall on Saturday, posted his diaries, photographs of his tattoos, and cryptic warnings of his coming attack on the Russian social media site OK.RU.
His diaries expressed hate for women, Jews, and “diversity,” rarely commenting on his own Hispanic ethnicity. He also posted pictures of his guns, body armour, and patches of skulls and the initials for “Right Wing Death Squad” popular with far-right militias.
But there was no indication that Garcia was a part of any group or had the support of anyone else in his Saturday attack. Garcia was shot dead by a police officer shortly after launching his attack on the busy mall in the suburb north of Dallas, authorities said. His victims included three members of a Korean-American family, two sisters of elementary school age, an Indian-American engineer, a security guard at the mall and a 32-year-old man.

1,New study finds prehistoric migrations from China to Americas,"WASHINGTON: As the last continents to be settled by humans, the question of how and when people first came to the...","WASHINGTON: As the last continents to be settled by humans, the question of how and when people first came to the Americas has long intrigued scientists.
A new genetics study published on Tuesday in Cell Reports finds that some of the first arrivals came from China during two distinct migrations: the first during the last ice age, and the second shortly after.
“Our findings indicate that besides the previously indicated ancestral sources of Native Americans in Siberia, the northern coastal China also served as a genetic reservoir contributing to the gene pool,” Yu-Chun Li, one of the report authors, said.
Li added that during the second migration, the same lineage of people settled in Japan, which could help explain similarities in prehistoric arrowheads and spears found in the Americas, China and Japan.
It was once believed that ancient Siberians, who crossed over a land bridge that existed in the Bering Strait linking modern Russia and Alaska, were the sole ancestors of Native Americans.
More recent research, from the late 2000s onwards, has signaled more diverse sources from Asia could be connected to an ancient lineage responsible for founding populations across the Americas, including Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico and California.
Known as D4h, this lineage is found in mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from mothers and is used to trace maternal ancestry.
The team from the Kunming Institute of Zoology embarked on a ten-year hunt for D4h, combing through 100,000 modern and 15,000 ancient DNA samples across Eurasia, eventually landing on 216 contemporary and 39 ancient individuals who came from the ancient lineage.
By analyzing the mutations that had accrued over time, looking at the samples’ geographic locations and using carbon dating, they were able to reconstruct the D4h’s origins and expansion history.
The results revealed two migration events. The first was between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum, when ice sheet coverage was at its greatest and climate conditions in northern China were likely inhospitable.
The second occurred during the melting period, between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago. Increasing human populations during this period might have triggered migrations.
It was during this second migration that the scientists found a surprising genetic link between Native Americans and Japanese people, particularly the indigenous Ainu.
In the melting period, a subgroup branched out from northern coastal China to Japan, contributing to the Japanese people, the study said, a finding that chimes with archeological similarities between ancient people in the Americas, China and Japan.
Li said a strength of the study was the number of samples they discovered, and complementary evidence from Y chromosomal DNA showing male ancestors of Native Americans lived in northern China at the same time as the female ancestors, made them confident of their findings.
“However, we don’t know in which specific place in northern coastal China this expansion occurred and what specific events promoted these migrations,” he said. “More evidence, especially ancient genomes, are needed to answer these questions.”

AN archaeologist works with human remains after they were unearthed in a cave on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain.—Reuters

 
LAS PALMAS: Archaeologists on Spain’s Gran Canaria island are puzzled: who were the six young men whose skeletons were found face-down, hands tied and covered with stones in a cliff-side cave? 
Evidence at the Caleta de Arriba site points to a violent death centuries ago which could pre-date the 15th century Spanish conquest of the archipelago off northwest Africa.
“They are not buried in the strict sense ... This is a funerary practice that denotes very strong symbolic violence,” explained Veronica Alberto, head of the excavation.
The bodies had been forcefully placed on the rocky surface and then had stones thrown on them, she said. Some had straps or bindings on their limbs.
“It could be an aboriginal burial, but due to the characteristics of the archaeological site we need to expand it and consider that they could be from other periods after the conquest, from 16th, 17th, 18th centuries,” Alberto added. Without objects to help establish the period, scientists are waiting for radiocarbon dating tests on the bones.
The archaeologists, who use security ropes while working on the steep terrain, said it was not a normal burial place because they only found men. All six had strong arms, suggesting they were involved in the same type of physical activity.

3,Iran executes on average 10 people per week: UN,"UN says at least 45 people, including 22 from the Baloch minority, were executed in the last 14 days alone.","GENEVA: UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on Tuesday that Iran has executed a “frighteningly” high number of people this year, rising to more than ten per week on average.
At least 209 people were executed in the country since January 1, primarily for drug-related offences, but a United Nations statement said the actual number is likely much higher.
“On average so far this year, over ten people are put to death each week in Iran, making it one of the world’s highest executors,” said Turk.
“At this rate, Iran is worryingly on the same track as last year when around 580 people were reportedly executed,” he added, calling this track record “abominable”.
Iran on Monday hanged two men on charges of spreading blasphemy on social media, prompting US condemnation and accusations from Amnesty International that the Islamic republic has reached a “new low” in a spree of executions.
On Saturday, Iran executed Swedish-Iranian dissident Habib Chaab for “terrorism”, prompting sharp criticism from Sweden and the European Union.
The UN said at least 45 people, including 22 from the Baloch minority, were executed in the last 14 days alone. Most were executed for drug-related charges.
“Imposing the death penalty for drug offences is incompatible with international human rights norms and standards,” said Turk.
“The Human Rights Committee… is clear on prohibiting imposition of the death penalty for any but the ‘most serious crimes’ - crimes of extreme gravity, involving intentional killing. Drug offences do not meet this threshold”.

4,Chinese woman appeals in battle for right to  freeze her eggs,"BEIJING: A single Chinese woman on Tuesday began an appeal in her legal battle for the right to freeze her eggs, a...","BEIJING: A single Chinese woman on Tuesday began an appeal in her legal battle for the right to freeze her eggs, a procedure only available in China to married couples.
Xu Zaozao took legal action in 2019 after a Beijing hospital refused to freeze her eggs but a Beijing court dismissed her case in July 2022. Her case is widely followed in China, where women’s rights have become an increasingly prominent issue and the falling birthrate is of growing concern. Xu says she wants to freeze her eggs to give herself the option of having a child alone if she cannot find a partner.
“I hope more people will recognise the fact that there is a whole diversity of single women,” Xu told the Beijing court where the appeal trial opened on Tuesday.
“They have the right to have autonomy in matters of reproduction and to make decisions concerning their own bodies,” she told journalists.
Since Xu lost her initial case in 2022 a lot has changed. China recorded the first decline in its population in six decades last year, against a backdrop of very low fertility rates (1.15 children per woman) and the government now strongly encourages people to have children.
In a revolutionary move, the southwest province of Sichuan in January said it would allow single people to register their child, while elsewhere in China it is an option still only available to married people.
This opening  “gives me hope” for greater consideration of women’s rights, Xu said.

5,"Australian lawmakers meet US envoy, seek release of Assange","SYDNEY: A cross-party delegation of Australian lawmakers said on Tuesday they met US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy,...","SYDNEY: A cross-party delegation of Australian lawmakers said on Tuesday they met US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, urging her to help drop the pending extradition case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and allow him to return to Australia.
The “Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Group” said it had informed the US envoy of “the widespread concern in Australia” about the continued detention of Assange, an Australian citizen.
The meeting comes ahead of US President Joe Biden’s scheduled visit to Australia this month for the Quad leaders’ summit.
“There are a range of views about Assange in the Australian community and the members of the Parliamentary Group reflect that diversity of views. But what is not in dispute in the Group is that Mr Assange is being treated unjustly,” the lawmakers said in a statement after meeting Kennedy in Canberra.
Assange is battling extradition from Britain to the United States where he is wanted on criminal charges over the release of confidential US military records and diplomatic cables in 2010. Washington says the release of the documents had put lives in danger.
Assange’s supporters say he is an anti-establishment hero who has been victimised because he exposed US wrongdoing, including in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The US embassy in Australia confirmed the meeting in a tweet but did not share further details.
Assange’s brother, Gabriel Shipton, said he felt the meeting was an “important acknowledgement” by the US government that “Julian’s freedom is important to millions of Australians”.
“After (Prime Minister Anthony Albanese) expressed frustration with the Biden administration, this is now a test for Ambassador Kennedy to see if she can move Washington on this issue,” he said.
Albanese, who has been advocating for the release of Assange, last week aired his frustration for not yet finding a diplomatic fix over the issue.
Support for Assange among US policy makers remains low. Only a few members of Congress have come forward in support of the demand to drop charges against him.
If extradited, Assange faces a sentence of up to 175 years in a maximum security prison.

6,African cheetah brought to India killed while mating,NEW DELHI: A cheetah brought to India from South Africa in a scheme to reintroduce the world’s fastest land animal...,"NEW DELHI: A cheetah brought to India from South Africa in a scheme to reintroduce the world’s fastest land animal was killed by its partner while mating on Tuesday, officials said, the project’s third recent fatality.
Daksha was one of 12 South African cheetahs relocated to India’s Kuno National Park along with another eight from Namibia, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi presiding over the release of the first arrivals into an enclosure.
“Initial assessment reveals the wounds on the female cheetah appear to have been caused by the male cheetah,” the park said in a statement.
“Such violent behaviour is normal during mating,” it added.  “It is impossible to monitor them in this situation.” Daksha is the third cheetah on the high-profile project to die in quick succession. Sasha, a male from Namibia, died of a kidney ailment in March and a South African male, Uday, died last month after it fell unwell. India was once home to the Asiatic cheetah but it was declared extinct there in 1952.
The reintroduction is the first intercontinental relocation of cheetahs and the programme aims to bring in about 100 of the animals over the next decade.

7,Pope Francis says Argentina govt wanted ‘my head’,"VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis said that when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires more than a decade ago, the Argentine...","VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis said that when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires more than a decade ago, the Argentine government wanted “to cut my head off” by backing false accusations that he had collaborated with the military dictatorship of the 1970s.
Pope Francis made his comments on April 29 in a private conversation with Jesuits while he was visiting Hungary. He is also a Jesuit and the comments were published on Tuesday in the Italian Jesuit journal Civilta Cattolica, as is customary after such meetings.
During Pope Francis’ visit, a Hungarian member of the Jesuits religious order asked him about his relationship with the late Father Frenc Jalics, a Hungarian-born Jesuit who did social work in a Buenos Aires shantytown and was arrested by the military on suspicion of helping leftist guerrillas.
Jalics was arrested in 1976 along with another Jesuit priest, Orlando Yorio, a Uruguayan. Yorio died in 2000 and Jalics died in 2021.
When Francis was elected pope in 2013, an Argentine journalist accused him of having betrayed the two priests when he was Father Jorge Mario Bergoglio and the superior of Argentine Jesuits during the military’s “dirty war” against leftists.
“The situation (during the dictatorship) was really very confused and uncertain. Then the legend developed that I had handed them over to be imprisoned,” the pope said.
Francis has always denied this and when he was elected pope, Jalics issued a statement saying the arrest was not the future pope’s fault.
In 2010, by which time the future pope had become archbishop of Buenos Aires, he testified before a three-judge panel investigating the period of dictatorship.
“Some people in the government wanted to ‘cut off my head’ ... (but) in the end my innocence was established,” he said.
The pope did not give details but as archbishop of Buenos Aires, he had an often rocky relationship with the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who served in that role from 2007-2015.
She accused him of taking sides politically, mostly during his visits to Buenos Aires shanty towns, and once avoided him by shunning a traditional Mass in the Argentine capital.
In the conversation with the Jesuits in Hungary, Pope Francis said that after he became pope, he met one of the three judges who had interrogated him in 2010 “and he told me clearly that they had received instructions from the government to convict me”.
Pope Francis’ uneasy relationship with Argentine politicians is believed to be one reason he has not yet returned to his homeland since he became pope.

8,Autopsies reveal organs missing in Kenya cult deaths,NAIROBI: Autopsies on corpses found in mass graves linked to a Kenyan cult have revealed missing organs and raised...,"NAIROBI: Autopsies on corpses found in mass graves linked to a Kenyan cult have revealed missing organs and raised suspicions of forced harvesting, investigators said on Tuesday as another 21 bodies were found.
A total of 133 people have so far been confirmed dead in the so-called “Shakahola forest massacre” since the discovery of mass graves last month shocked the deeply religious Christian-majority country.
Police believe most of the bodies found near Malindi on Kenya’s Indian Ocean coast were followers of self-styled pastor Paul Nthenge Mackenzie, who is accused of ordering them to starve to death “to meet Jesus”.
While starvation appears to be the main cause of death, some of the victims — including children — were strangled, beaten, or suffocated, according to chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor. Investigators said on Tuesday they believed more bodies would be found in coming days.
“We have 21 bodies exhumed today from nine graves, and this exercise will continue tomorrow,” said regional commissioner Rhoda Onyancha. The latest exhumations took the overall toll to 133, she added.
Court documents filed on Monday said some of the corpses had their organs removed, with police alleging the suspects were engaged in forced harvesting of body parts.
“Post mortem reports have established missing organs in some of the bodies of victims who have been exhumed,” chief inspector Martin Munene said in an affidavit filed to a Nairobi court.
It is “believed that trade on human body organs has been well coordinated involving several players”, he said, giving no details about the suspected trafficking.
Munene said Ezekiel Odero, a high-profile televangelist who was arrested last month in connection with the same case and granted bail on Thursday, had received “huge cash transactions,” allegedly from Mackenzie’s followers who sold their property at the cult leader’s bidding.

9,CPJ sees a pattern behind journalists’ death in Israel,Report says Israel’s army is responsible for 8pc of journalist and media worker killings in the Palestinian territories.,"WASHINGTON: The killing of Shireen Abu Akleh, one of the Arab world’s most recognisable journalists, was not an isolated event, it was part of a pattern, warns a report released in the United States on Tuesday.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which prepared the report, has documented at least 20 journalist killings by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) since 2001.
 






 






The vast majority — 18 — were Palestinian; two were European foreign correspondents; there were no Israelis. No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths.
Shireen, a Palestinian-American journalist who worked for Al Jazeera for 25 years, was one of the most prominent names across the Middle East for her decades of reporting in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
On 11 May 2022, while covering an IDF raid on the Jenin Refugee camp in the West Bank, Shireen was shot and killed, although she was wearing a blue vest with “PRESS” written on it. The CPJ report insisted that her killing was “part of a deadly, decades-long pattern” to intimidate journalists.

At least 20 media persons killed by Israeli Defence Forces: report

“Despite numerous IDF probes, no one has ever been charged or held responsible for these deaths,” the report added. “The impunity in these cases has severely undermined the freedom of the press … (in) the region.”
Five months after Shireen’s death, an IDF probe concluded there was a “high possibility” that one of its soldiers “accidentally” shot the journalist while firing on Palestinian gunmen. To date, no one has been held accountable. CPJ Director of Special Projects Robert Mahoney said in a statement released with the report that Shireen’s “killing and the failure of the army’s investigative process to hold anyone responsible (was) not a one-off event.”
Hagai El-Ad, the executive director of Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. said “Israel’s efforts to examine its soldiers’ actions, particularly when it comes to Palestinian journalists killed, amount to less of a serious inquiry than a theatre of investigation.”
According to the CPJ report, Israel’s army is responsible for 80 per cent of journalist and media worker killings in the Palestinian territories. The other 20pc — five cases — died due to different causes.
CPJ’s research spans some of the most violent and repressive years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, from the start of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada, in 2000, to repeated Israeli operations against militants.
The research showed that all deaths took place in the West Bank, territory under Israeli military occupation, or in Gaza, a coastal strip under Israeli military blockade. No journalist was killed within Israel’s internationally recognised borders.
The report noted that deaths were just one part of the story. Many journalists have been injured, and in 2021 the military bombed Gaza buildings that housed offices of more than a dozen local and international media outlets, including The Associated Press and Al-Jazeera.
CPJ reminded Israeli authorities that “journalists are civilians under international law, and as such militaries must take steps to safeguard them during hostilities.”

10,Manipur villages reduced to smouldering ruins,"Thousands of troops deployed to restore order while 23,000 residents have fled their homes for safety of ad-hoc army-run camps.","HEIROKLIAN: The road to Heiroklian is smooth and freshly laid, with a sign proclaiming it part of an Indian government development initiative. But ethnic violence has reduced the village itself to little more than smouldering ashes.
Sanatomba picked through the ruins of his sister’s home in the state of Manipur, trying to salvage anything of value, but could only recover a traditional stool.
“This used to be my sister’s kitchen,” the 20-year-old says.
“That was her room and she kept her TV there, the fridge there, the almirah (cupboard) for clothes there. But now everything she shared with her husband, four children and other family members is gone forever.” More than 50 people have been killed in the hilly border region in clashes between the majority Meitei people, who are mostly Hindus, and the mainly Christian Kuki tribe.
Thousands of troops have been deployed to restore order, while around 23,000 residents have fled their homes for the safety of ad-hoc army-run camps for the displaced.
Sanatomba’s sibling is among them. They are Kuki, and he is sure she and her family will never be able to return.
“She told me to come here and look for anything I can find,” he says, his hands and feet covered in black soot.
The rest of the village suffered a similar fate, its three settlements littered with broken doors, burnt-down water tanks, and forced-open metal trunks.
The towering village church, a school building, and even a jackfruit trees were set on fire by the attackers. The raiders stole residents’ cattle and poultry, Sanatomba said.
“Those animals they couldn’t take alive, they killed and took away as meat. “I am afraid of Meitei people.” 
‘Broken hearts’
The far-flung states of northeast India — sandwiched between Bangladesh, China and Myanmar — have long been a tinderbox of tensions between different ethnic groups.
The spark for the latest ethnic clash was a protest about plans to give the Meitei “Scheduled Tribe” status.
A form of affirmative action to combat structural inequality and discrimination, that classification would give them guaranteed quotas of government jobs and college admissions.
Violence erupted in the regional capital Imphal and elsewhere, with protestors setting fire to vehicles and buildings. According to villagers, Meitei mobs armed with guns and petrol cans then attacked Kuki settlements in the hills.
Authorities are concerned there could be more reprisal attacks “as both communities have now accumulated weapons”, an army officer said.
“Are you sure that none of you have any weapons that you would like to surrender?” a senior officer asked a Kuki gathering at a village outside Imphal on Monday.
“The other community has promised to surrender their weapons if you do too,” he added. “I want you to consider this as it doesn’t help either community to have these weapons in circulation.” None of the mostly male audience did so.
Thanglallem Kuki, 32, a teacher at a private school, watched from a hilltop as his village of Kamuching was attacked and burned to the ground, spending two nights in the jungle before being rescued and taken to an army camp.
He said the Meitei mob went from house to house, retrieving valuables, electronic gadgets, cooking gas cylinders, and even mattresses, loading their loot into vehicles.
