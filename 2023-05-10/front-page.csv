• IHC declares arrest ‘within parameters’, initiates contempt proceedings against interior secretary, IG
• Protesters storm corps commander’s house in Lahore; one death reported from Quetta
• Internet services disrupted
• PTI condemns arrest from court premises
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on the premises of the Islam­abad judicial complex by a contingent of Rangers in connection with a corruption case set off a ser­ies of violent protests across the country, including in the high-security zones where PTI supporters and the law enforcers faced off.
The detention which the Islamabad High Court (IHC) said was made within parameters, came hours after the PTI chairman upped the ante by claiming that he could prove his allegations that an intelligence officer was behind the assassination attempt on him.
The arrest triggered claims and counter-claims by the government and the opposition PTI, with the former defending it while the latter condemning the action.
Soon after the arrest, Section 144 was imposed in Islamabad and some other places to control the law and order situation while exams in some cities were postponed in light of violent protests which continued into the night.
 
 

Twitter and some other social media services were also suspended on the instructions of the interior ministry. Some protesters took out their wrath on the military, storming the residence of the corps commander in Lahore and laying siege to a gate of the army’s General Headquar­ters in Rawalpindi.
Police fired teargas and water cannon to disperse Mr Khan’s sup­p­orters in Karachi and Lahore, while protesters blocked roads in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Pesha­war, Faisalabad, Multan, Quetta, etc.
Contempt proceedings
The way Mr Khan was arrested also prompted the Islamabad High Court to initiate contempt proceedings against the interior secretary and the police chief of Islamabad for mishandling the arrest, though it agreed the detention was made within the parameters.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq issued contempt notices to both these officials and directed the registrar’s office to get a case registered over the ransacking of the court premises.
After an inquiry by the registrar, responsibility will be fixed in the case and a senior officer would be appointed to register an FIR in this regard. Further hearing was adjourned till May 16.
Imran arrested
In a surprise move, Rangers detained Imran Khan from the high court in an operation that lasted barely three minutes and whisked him away in a black vehicle.
The PTI chief was scheduled to appear before the IHC chief justice in connection with his petitions seeking to quash FIRs registered against him at the Ramna police station for inciting mutiny and with the Secretariat police over violence outside the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Mr Khan also appeared before an anti-terrorism court and the judge confirmed his bail in seven different cases.
In addition, Mr Khan sought pre-arrest interim bail from the IHC in a National Acco­un­tability Bureau (NAB) investigation on charges of corruption in the Al-Qadir University Trust case.
Mr Khan was required to conduct biometric verification at the diary branch of the IHC, but the Rangers contingent arrested him in the same case while he was completing this process.
In its case, NAB alleged that the PTI government struck a deal with Malik Riaz that caused a loss of more than $239m to the national exchequer, in a quid pro quo arrangement with the real estate businessman. In December 2019, Britain’s National Crime Agency had accepted a settlement offer of £190m, which included a UK property — 1 Hyde Park Place, London, W2 2LH.
It was valued approximately at £50m and all of the funds landed in the frozen accounts of Malik Riaz. Later, former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife were accused of accepting billions in cash and hundreds of kanals of land from Bahria Town in return for the help that Mr Khan’s government extended to Malik Riaz during the NCA investigation against him.
IHC proceedings over arrest
The arrest created a wave of unrest among the PTI lawyers present in the IHC to welcome Imran Khan. Chief Justice Aamer Far­ooq took up the matter and summoned the secretary of the interior, the Islamabad police chief, and the additional attorney general.
During the hearing, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and advocate Ali Bukhari, who accompanied Mr Khan, recalled the events leading up to the arrest of their client.
Barrister Gohar told the court that Mr Khan was sitting in the diary branch to complete the verification process when some officials of Rangers appeared all of a sudden and tried to enter the office. However, when they found that the door was locked, they broke the windows and used pepper spray to discourage resistance.
Barrister Gohar stated that one of the personnel struck Mr Khan on the head and another kicked his injured leg. He said that the officials then dragged PTI chairman from the said office to shift him into their vehicle.
Advocate Bukhari said that he was with Mr Khan in the ATC and then came with him to the IHC. He further said that Mr Khan’s movement was also being monitored through a drone.
Mr Bukhari told the court that after the Rangers used pepper spray, he could not see what happened and he also got injured in this incident. According to him, the Rangers smashed the windows and hurled abuses at Mr Khan.
‘Against dignity of court’

During the hearing, IHC Chief Justice observed that this matter is against the dignity and independence of the court, and anything beyond set parameters will not be tolerated and any person whether a minister or prime minister if found responsible will be taken to the task.
Advocate Khawaja Haris Ahmed argued that Mr Khan learnt that the inquiry in Al Qadir Trust was upgraded into an investigation on April 30 through a newspaper. He asserted that Mr Khan was seeking pre-arrest bail and also filed a petition before the IHC.
He argued that the investigation agencies show restraint in such situations and they keep waiting for the court’s orders but in this case, Mr Khan was arrested while he was resorting to legal course.
Additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal told the court that since the arrest has been made, the counsel could approach the accountability court to redress grievances.
“This is not simple as such,” remarked Justice Farooq. He then summoned director general and prosecutor general of NAB and adjourned the hearing.
When the hearing was resumed, NAB Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi told the court that the bureau asked the federal government for Mr Khan’s arrest after serving him repeated call-up notices.
Inspector General Akbar Nasir Khan told the court that during the incident, some police officials also got injured. He denied having prior information regarding the arrest of Mr Khan but assured the court that he could probe the matter.
Violent protests
In Rawalpindi and Islamabad, violent confrontations between the police and PTI supporters were witnessed followed by a crackdown on party supporters. In Rawalpindi, sensitive installations, including GHQ and Hamza Camp (Ojhri Camp), were targeted by the PTI supporters.
Two police officials –Waris Khan DSP Tahir Sikandar and Ratta Amral SHO Chaudhry Riaz were also injured in an altercation with the PTI workers.
The metro bus service was also suspended between the two cities.
In Lahore, the PTI workers gathered at Liberty Chowk and started marching towards the Cantonment. The announcements were made on social media sites to reach the Cantonment to protest outside the military corps commander’s house.
In footage circulating on different social media platforms, the PTI workers carrying clubs and party flags reached the corps commander’s house in the Cantonment area.
The protestors forced their way into the house while chanting slogans against the arrest of their chairman. They were also seen breaking the windowpanes, TV, and furniture of the house and also setting the trees and furniture on fire.
In another video, the PTI activists could also be seen pelting stones and bottles at an army convoy on Mall Road. The workers also set police vehicles outside Fortress Stadium Lahore on fire in addition to several security posts in the Cantt.
Sindh
In Karachi, hundreds of PTI workers took to the street in different parts of the province against the arrest of party chairman Imran Khan prompting action from the police resulting in the arrest of Ali Zaidi, a couple of MPAs, and dozens of opposition party workers.
Sharea Faisal turned into a battleground hardly an hour after the arrest of Mr Khan when PTI Karachi chapter president Aftab Siddiqi urged the workers to reach Insaf House – the party headquarters. As the workers marched on Sharea Faisal suspending traffic on the key road link, the police resorted to baton-charge and teargas shelling which attracted a strong reaction from the protests. In a three-hour-long face-off between police and the protesters, over a dozen vehicles, including a police van, and two check posts each of the Karachi police and Pakistan Rangers were set on fire.
In KP, after learning about the arrest of the PTI chief, scores of the opposition party’s workers reached the Hashtnagar Chowk in Peshawar blocking the Grand Trunk Road.
The protesters torched the replica of the Chaghi Mountain, where Pakistan conducted its first nuclear test in 1998. They also smashed the main gate of the provincial assembly’s building and threw stones inside the premises.
In Quetta, one person was killed and over a dozen injured, including six police personnel were injured in clashes between workers in clashes between the protesting PTI workers and police during a demonstration against the arrest of Imran Khan.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, protesters blocked many roads, including Karakoram Highway, at various points, leaving a number of travellers stranded.

• Rana Sana refutes allegations former premier was tortured
• Shehbaz extends London stay by a day ‘on Nawaz’s instructions’
ISLAMABAD: An hour before the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday accused Mr Khan of maligning the army without proof, running a media campaign against martyred troops and using religion for political gains.
Meanwhile, the interior and law ministers claimed that the government had no role in what is being dubbed by PTI leaders “vindictive action” and that Mr Khan’s arrest had been made as per law by executing the warrants issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
Prime Minister Sharif, who has extended his London stay for another day, said in a detailed tweet directed at Mr Khan: “I have no doubt that your politics is defined by blatant lies, untruths, U-turns, and vicious attacks on institutions.”
“Imran Khan while on a trial for corruption is claiming legitimacy to overturn the legal and political system,” he said, alleging that Mr Khan was trying to bend the judiciary to his whims and behaving as if rules didn’t apply to him.
 






Mr Sharif pointed out that maligning the military as an institution was a recurring pattern in Mr Khan’s politics after his last year’s ouster as prime min­ister through a parliamentary no-confidence vote.
“Did you not resort to constant mudslinging of the leadership of the army and intelligence agency much before the Wazirabad attack?” Mr Sharif said, putting counter-questions to Mr Khan against his earlier tweets.
He said the PTI chief refused the offer of cooperation from the federal government and boycotted the legal proceedings.
Mr Khan, he said, was never interested in finding the truth about the attack but used the incident for petty political objectives.
“What legal route did you adopt other than hurling threats and making baseless allegations almost on a daily basis?” he asked Mr Khan.
He questioned at whose behest the savaging social media campaign against the martyrs of the armed forces was launched after a helicopter crash in Balochistan.
“Which party did the troll brigade belong to that mocked the martyrs, which was a new low and unimaginable in our politics and culture? With these subversive and treacherous acts on your part, do we need an enemy?” he said.
Mr Sharif said, “Who used religion for political purposes by describing the political agitation in religious terms, a cunning and self-serving attempt at exposing political opponents to violence at the hands of your supporters.”
He recalled that Mr Khan’s party leaders cond­oned, justified, and even celebrated the incident of harassment and intimidation of an official delegation, including a female minister, in the courtyard of Masjid-i-Nabwi (PBUH) by disregarding all norms of reverence and devoutness.
“As for your assertion of Pakistan becoming a ‘jungle’, I advise you not to go there, for the facts are often bitter and disastrous. Let us keep this for another day,” he said.
PM extends UK visit
Later, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Sharif had extended his stay in London by one day for consultations on important political and national issues on the instructions of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.
In a tweet, she said the prime minister would now leave for home on Wednesday.
‘Govt has no control over NAB’
Meanwhile, federal interior and law ministers insisted that incriminating evidence of Mr Khan’s involvement in corruption was available.
While the PTI condemned the arrest and called for a countrywide shutdown and street protests against the arrest, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, at separate pressers on Tuesday, declared that nobody would be allowed to harm public or private property under the garb of peaceful protests.
The interior minister said NAB was an independent institution and the government had no control over it, nor had it attempted to do so. “I, as the interior minister, can say on oath that I have never met a NAB officer, nor have I taken a briefing on this case,” he claimed.
Responding to a question, Mr Sanaullah also rebuffed PTI’s allegations about vindication and asserted that there was evidence of “documented corruption” in this matter though there were several corruption cases and several NAB inquiries underway against Mr Khan.
Giving details of the Al-Qadir Trust case, the corruption reference in which Mr Khan was arrested, the interior minister regretted that the Supreme Court had not taken suo motu notice of the matter involving the source of the amount, whom it belonged to and why it was coming to Pakistan.
He then dared all protesting leaders of the PTI to tell the names of the trustees and provide a money trail for the property bought in the trust’s name.
He claimed that evidence was available for the entire chain of events he talked about.
Also, the Toshakhana allegations against the PTI chief were “proved”, he said, reiterating that Mr Khan was “committing theft” when false cases were being filed against PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and his family members.
He said NAB had issued notices to the PTI chief regarding the corruption cases against him and asked him to present himself and become a part of the investigation. “It was necessary for him to present himself and give answers, but he preferred not to do so.
“Mr Khan rather challenged those notices in the high court and ultimately the high court said that the [legal] process in accordance with law could not be stopped and he should become a part of the investigation and submit his response, yet he did not feel it appropriate to become a part of the investigation because of which NAB had to execute his arrest,” Mr Sanaullah explained.
The minister said there was a little resistance shown at the time of Mr Khan’s arrest by his gunmen, but no one was hurt during the arrest.
About Mr Khan’s former adviser on accountability Shehzad Akbar, the interior minister said he would be brought back to the country and the government would facilitate NAB if it chose to act against him. He believed some of Mr Khan’s cabinet members at the time should be made part of the investigation for sharing some responsibility in the matter.
While warning PTI protesters against creating unrest and blocking traffic on roads, he said he had instructed all the provincial chief secretaries and inspector generals of police to strictly act against those who attempt to create a law-and-order situation.
“They have no right to do this and if anyone tries to do so, then the law will be implemented against them with its full might.”
Asked about the role of the Rangers in the arrest, Mr Sanaullah said the force was “constantly deployed” in Islamabad and provided support in the arrest to execute warrants and prevent any untoward incident.
Mr Sanaullah also tweeted earlier to refute the allegations that Mr Khan was tortured while being arrested.
Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar told a presser that the PTI chief’s arrest was made as per law by executing the arrest warrant and said a seven-member medical board also examined him immediately after his arrest.
He said Mr Khan would be presented before court to seek remand and it was up to the court to accept or reject the request. It was also the court’s prerogative to determine the remand period, he added.
About demonstrations by PTI supporters, Mr Tarar said holding protests was a fundamental right of every individual, but civilised nations keep those peaceful.
He said PTI supporters and leaders should let the law take its course instead of settling court matters on the roads. He also declared that the government would not allow anybody to harm public or private property.

2,"Pakistan could default without IMF bailout, warns Moody’s","Power minister Dastgir says after weathering difficult times, the country is slowly but surely moving towards financial stability.","KARACHI: Pakistan could default without an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout as its financing options beyond June are uncertain, the credit ratings agency Moody’s Investor Service said on Tuesday.
“We consider that Pakistan will meet its external payments for the remainder of this fiscal year ending in June,” Grace Lim, a sovereign analyst with the ratings company in Singapore, told Bloomberg, according to a Dawn.com report.
“However, Pakistan’s financing options beyond June are highly uncertain. Without an IMF programme, Pakistan could default given its very weak reserves,” he said.
Meanwhile, Federal Min­ister for Power Khu­r­ram Dastgir Khan told Adil Shahzeb of Dawn News that the failure to sign a staff-level agreem­ent between the IMF and Pakistan could lead to the country’s increased reliance on China, which the US and other Western powers “must take into account”.
He said international oil transactions had been gradually shifting from the US dollar to other currencies, particularly the Chinese yuan.
The minister said that while Pakistan had met all technical requirements, there was still a possibility that the staff-level agreement might not be reached due to geopolitical factors, and he suggested that Fin­a­nce Minister Ishaq Dar would be better suited to provide clarity on the matter.
He expressed his opinion that in the event the country was unable to complete the staff-level agreement, Pakistan would fulfil all its financial commitments with the help of China or other friendly nations, and that the country would still strive to present the best possible budget given the circumstances.
When asked whether Pakistan was likely to default, as predicted by experts in Western countries, Mr Dastgir said these experts had been predicting Pakistan’s default for over a year.
However, he emphasised that Pakistan had not delayed a single payment, and after weathering difficult times, the country was slowly but surely moving towards financial stability, he added.
Pakistan entered into a $6.5 billion programme with the IMF in 2019. But the programme’s ninth review for the release of $1.2 billion has been pending since October last year as the government has been unable to meet some of the prerequisites set by the lender.
The IMF tranche is critical for Pakistan as it will also unlock financing from friendly countries, helping Pakistan avert default.
The country has been witnessing economic turmoil since last year, with its foreign exchange reserves down to critical levels, while talks with the IMF for the release of the pending tranche have remained unsuccessful thus far.
An IMF delegation was in Pakistan in February this year for talks with the government to revive the programme.
After the delegation left, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said negotiations with the lender had “nearly concluded” and a staff-level agreement would happen “next week”. But more than two months since then, an agreement is still not in sight.
Meanwhile, reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan stood at $4.46bn during the week ending on April 28, enough to cover just a month’s imports.
Inflation has also soared to unprecedented levels. The consumer price index rose to a record 36.4 per cent in April from a year earlier, mainly driven by skyrocketing food prices and rising energy costs.

3,‘Contempt of parliament’ bill lands in NA,"Lawmakers to get powers to punish those belittling parliament, bodies.","ISLAMABAD: In a significant move, the government on Tuesday allowed introduction of a crucial private member’s bill in the National Assembly seeking to empower the lawmakers to punish those committing contempt of parliament or its committees and breaching the privilege of any member of any house of parliament on the pattern of the contempt of court law.
The bill titled “Contempt of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) Bill 2023” was tabled by PTI dissident Rana Qasim Noon and it was supported one by one by almost all the parties present in the National Assembly and the lawmakers termed the move too late, saying that such a law should have been enforced much earlier.
Though, some of the lawmakers, including opposition leader Raja Riaz, called for immediate passage of the bill, Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf on the request of Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar referred it to the committee concerned with the directive to come up with its report within seven days.
The law minister was of the view that they must adopt a proper procedure to unanimously pass this important bill and there should be no impression that they had passed the legislation in haste. Moreover, he said, the committee would be able to further “fine-tune” the bill as some of the members had raised objections over its language. The minister was of the view that this bill would ensure establishment of the writ of parliament.

Lawmakers to get powers to punish those belittling parliament, bodies

Mohsin Leghari of the PTI did not oppose the bill, but said that they should not give a “blind approval” to the proposed law and the members should be provided an opportunity to go through the text of the draft law.
Under the proposed law, “the power to award punishment” rests with the National Assembly or the Senate on the recommendations of the 24-member “Contempt Committee” to be formed by the National Assembly speaker and the decision of the House, according to the proposed law, “shall be the decision of the majority of the members present and voting”.
According to Section 9 of the proposed act, “whoever is found guilty of contempt of a House or a committee …… shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to Rs10 million or with both.”
Section 10 of the said bill says that “any decision of a House shall be executed and enforced by judicial magistrate under whose territorial jurisdiction the accused is temporarily residing under relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898)”.
The proposed law also provides the right of appeal to the convicted person which would then be heard by the lawmakers in a joint sitting of the parliament. The appeal before the joint sitting must be filed within 30 days of the announcement of the verdict. The joint sitting will have the powers to decide the appeal or may refer such appeal to another committee of the joint sitting which shall give its final report also within thirty days. The proposed law has empowered parliament to prescribe rules and procedures for hearing of the appeal and the formation of the joint committee.
“The Speaker shall within thirty days of the commencement of this Act, constitute a Contempt Committee for the purposes mentioned in this Act. The Contempt Committee shall consist of 24 members having equal representation from each House [Senate and NA],” says the bill.
According to the draft law, the committee shall have 14 members from the treasury benches, to be nominated by the Leader of the House, “including seven members from each House and 10 from the opposition benches, five from each House”. The members of the opposition will be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition of each House.
According to the bill, a person is said to have committed contempt of parliament, if he is found to have “willfully breached the privilege of a member, a House or a committee; violated any law guarantying the immunities or privileges of the members; failed or refused to obey any order or direction of a House or a committee; refused to give evidence or recorded false statement before a committee; attempted or influenced a witness either by intimidation, threat or use of force to prevent him from providing evidence, producing documents or appearing before the committee; and failed to provide any documents or submitted tempered documents before a House or a committee”.
Any house of parliament trough a motion can charge any person for contempt of a House and the speaker or the Senate chairman may refer the matter to the “Contempt Committee”.
Section 6 of the proposed law says that “right of fair trial as enshrined in the Constitution shall be provided to each but no one shall be allowed to appear before the committee through legal practitioner or an advocate”.
“The Contempt Committee shall have powers as vested in civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 01 of 1908, for enforcing the attendance of any person and compelling the production of documents” and will have the powers to issue summons and arrest warrants with the final approval of the NA speaker or the Senate chairman, says the draft of the proposed law.
It says that any document, produced or evidence recorded by the committee shall not be admissible as evidence in any court and “any person giving evidence or producing documents before the Committee shall not be liable to any civil, criminal or departmental proceedings”.
The Statement of Objects and Reasons attached to the bill says the parliamentary committees act as extension of their respective houses and such committees not only give threadbare consideration to proposed legislation but also perform oversighting functions, including conduct of public hearings.

4,Situationer: On Red Lines and Green Signals,The connection of Imran's arrest to the ISPR’s statement from a day before  indicate malicious intent on behalf of the sitting govt.,"CONSIDER the logic of politics of spectacle. Within hours of former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest at Islamabad High Court on Tuesday, videos showing dozens of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers storming the premises of GHQ in Islamabad and Lahore Corps Commander’s residence began making the rounds on social media.
In Karachi, videos of police firing shells at protesters on Sharea Faisal circulated on all media channels. In Multan, protesters blocked Bahawalpur Bypass Chowk and Nawan Shehar and agitated against the police deployed there to arrest the protesters under Section 144.
In Peshawar, protesters clashed with journalists injuring several. The Swat Motorway toll plaza was set alight. Protesters and residents from these cities complained about teargas wafting in the air even in places where the protests weren’t happening.
If anything, the imposition of Section 144 in all major cities in hopes of maintaining public order almost ensured the virality of these images and videos. In a political culture where corruption alone becomes the raison d’etre for politics, it quickly becomes the method of politics itself, the art of electoral wins and defeat loses meaning. What we are left with is a game of semiotics: empty gestures, institutions without integrity, and players strategising to lose.
There should be no doubt that Imran Khan’s arrest had little to do with upholding the constitution and everything to do with fear and intimidation. Former Herald editor Badar Alam said unless all institutions come clean, the cases against Imran Khan will be nothing more than a witch hunt by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) whose role has, since its formation, been exactly this — to hold witch hunts against political rivals.
“Any arrest by NAB is unconstitutional. The brainchild of a military dictator, it exists to allow selective corruption to take place and to target political rivals,” he said.
The events of May 9, 2023 will have important repercussions on the direction this country’s politics will take. The instability and destabilizing impacts of Imran Khan’s own politics and political machinery will ensure that the political crisis and PTI’s street power pick up momentum in the following weeks. Arresting Imran Khan will lead to no fruitful impact.
In fact, Alam says, it may further steer politics firmly into the realm of spectacles where every move happens on whims and fancy with no institutional separation of power.
Crossing Red Lines
Earlier before departing for his hearing in Islamabad, the PTI chief recorded a video of himself reasserting his earlier claims against DG-C Maj Gen Faisal Naseer, whom he has accused of being involved in an assassination attempt against him in Wazirabad.
 
 

Earlier at a rally on Saturday, the PTI chairman had again named the senior intelligence officer for planning to assassinate him. “My question is: [Despite being] a country’s ex-prime minister — because this man’s name has come forward — [why was] I unable to register a first information report (FIR)?” he asked in the video on Tuesday. He went on to say that even when his party was in power in the Punjab, they were unable to name the officer in the FIR.
Responding to Khan’s claims, on Monday, the military’s PR wing stated that Khan’s claims against the intelligence officer were “irresponsible and baseless”.
The statement went on to say that the PTI chairman had levelled baseless charges against the intelligence officer without evidence. “This fabricated and malicious allegation is extremely unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable,” the statement said.
On Tuesday, Khan responded to this statement saying, “ISPR sahib, listen to me carefully.
Respect is not [confined] to a single institution; respect should be for every single citizen,“ It is possible that the ISPR statement was taken to mean a green signal from the military establishment to go ahead and take punitive measures against Khan.
 
 

Professor of political science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences Muhammad Waseem said prior to Imran Khan’s statements and ISPR’s response to it, the establishment had tried to cultivate an image of neutrality. “However, there seems to be a turn of the tides,” he said.
Sensing green signals
Ever since Khan’s ouster through a no-confidence motion in April 2022, the PTI chairman has tried to sustain his popularity through populist narratives. Professor Waseem, who is currently researching Imran Khan’s populist expatriate base, said, “I look at Imran Khan as someone brought from outside the system to put an end to the domination of two parties and dynastic politics… hence the PTI emerged as the King’s Party.”
His entire branding as a national hero, famed cricketer turned philanthropist, ensured his rise to fame especially among the expatriate classes. A section of the PTI cadre has previously worked with Khan on the Shaukat Khanum Hospital project as well, and most of that cadre is abroad.
Themes of distance nationalism spurred PTI’s popularity in a way such that the law itself became an institution of politics. “Whether something is constitutional or not, it doesn’t matter anymore because the distinction itself has been blurred,” he said.
Politics of spectacle
Imran Khan was arrested for the purpose of investigation in the Al Qadir Trust case on orders of NAB chairman. The PTI chairman and his wife were accused of corruption in exchange for land to build a university near Islamabad.
On social media, it is the legality of the arrest and not the case itself – which involves certain real estate tycoons nearly all politicians have been reluctant to name – which has been the subject of debate and discussion.
Under the NAB Ordnance, lawyer Asad Jamal explained, the bureau has powers to arrest an accused for inquiry. This was established in 2002 when Asfandyar Wali had challenged it and the Supreme Court had upheld these powers. Rangers can be called in to act “in aid of” civilian law and order forces under Article 245 of the Constitution.
The government will have to provide evidence of having complied with rules of the ordnance and show that they had issued warrants and informed the PTI chairman of the warrant earlier.
The optics of Tuesday’s arrest cast a shadow on NAB. Khan was arrested as he was providing his biometric data ahead of another hearing which did not take place.
The connection of this arrest to the ISPR’s statement from a day before, and the presence of Rangers and police prepared to take down protesters with water cannons and teargas, indicate malicious intent on behalf of the sitting government.
 
 

It appears that the current government might seek to remove Imran Khan from the political scene, by either disqualifying him from contesting by ensuring conviction in one of the hundred cases filed against him or send him and then keep him behind bars.
Badar Alam cautions against such tactics. PTI’s protesters have come a long way from where they began 15 years ago. They have faced repression like this before and police action is not enough to take them down. As images of protesters stealing peacocks from the Lahore corps commanders house and setting a portion of the house on fire circulate and take on new meanings for supporters within the country and outside, Alam insists that the only way forward from here is politics.

5,"Heatwave to roast southern regions this week, says Met dept","Day temperatures are likely to be three to five degrees Celsius above normal in Sindh, south Punjab and parts of Balochistan.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Met­e­oro­logical Department has forecast that regions in the country’s southern half would face a sudden rise in day temperatures this week while temperatures are likely to rise gradually in other parts of the country.
According to the weather advisory of Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment released on Tuesday, the presence of high pressure in the upper atmosphere would the day temperatures are likely to increase gradually in most parts of the country particularly in southern half of the country from May 10 to 13.
Day temperatures are likely to be three to five degrees Celsius above normal in Sindh, south Punjab and parts of Balochistan.
The mercury will be two to three degrees Celsius above normal in upper and central Punjab, Islam­abad, upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir.
The Met department advised farmers to manage the watering of crops accordingly. The general public was advised to avoid unnecessary exposure to direct sunlight and to use water judiciously.
Minister’s counsel
The Federal Minis­ter for Climate Change and Environ­mental Coordination, Senator Sherry Rehman, has advised institutions to observe precautions in order to safeguard public health and to minimise the impact of extreme weather on vulnerable communities.
The minister’s call to action came in response to the latest weather forecast made by the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s (PMD) for this month.
In her appeal, Sherry Rehman called upon all institutions to follow the Ministry for Climate Change’s recently issued ‘Heatwave Guidelines — Urgent Preparatory Measures’. These guidelines offered a proactive approach to prevent the spread of heat-related illnesses and provide critical information on how to prepare for and respond to extreme heat events.
Key short-term measures specified in the Guidelines included the activation of union council-level response units (HRU) and establishing provincial level control rooms for coordination to protect vulnerable segments of the urban population.
Sherry Rehman outlined several medium- to long-term measures to address the underlying causes of heatwaves, for example climate-induced disaster management to school curriculums, increasing green spaces by planting more trees in urban areas, establishing ‘cool centres’ at easily accessible public locations, and developing an early Heat-Health Warning System.
These steps, the minister emphasised, would help build the country’s resilience to extreme weather events and protect the health and safety of its citizens in the long run.
“The effects of climate change, especially with increasing greenhouse gas emissions globally, are contributing to more frequent, highly severe, and longer lasting heatwaves across the region and the country.”
Most vulnerable countries
The minister highlighted that Pakistan was listed among the ten most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world, experiencing frequent climate induced disasters. Over the past decade, the frequency of hot days had been three times higher than the frequency of cold days at the global scale.
“Pakistan has recorded the hottest temperatures on the planet consistently for the last three years, and with El Niño expected to return this year which could push global temperatures past the 1.5°C mark with devastating impacts on ecosystems & vulnerable countries.
