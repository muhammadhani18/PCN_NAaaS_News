0,15 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza,Islamic Jihad vows to ‘avenge’ deaths; Netanyahu warns ‘enemies’ not to ‘mess with us’.,"GAZA CITY: A series of Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday killed three Islamic Jihad group leaders and 12 other people, with both sides bracing for an escalation.
Islamic Jihad vowed to “avenge” the deaths in a pre-dawn raid involving some 40 Israeli aircraft, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning “our enemies” to not “mess with us”.
 






The first Israeli strike hit targets in the crowded coastal territory for nearly two hours from just after 2am (2300 GMT Monday).
The Gaza health ministry said four children were among those killed and 20 people were wounded, with some in critical condition in the attacks which left buildings ablaze and reduced others to rubble.

Islamic Jihad vows to ‘avenge’ deaths; Netanyahu warns ‘enemies’ not to ‘mess with us’

The Israeli army said it had targeted three leaders of Islamic Jihad, which it considers a terrorist group, as well as its “weapon manufacturing sites”.
Army spokesman Daniel Hagari expressed regret over the death of “uninvolved” people but said they were hard to avoid as “we are working against terrorists that conduct their activities day and night among civilians.”
Islamic Jihad confirmed the deaths of three senior members — Jihad Ghannam, Khalil al-Bahtini and Tareq Ezzedine — before their bodies were later carried through the streets in mass funeral processions.
A separate air strike in the late afternoon on the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza killed two men in a car, the health ministry said.
The Israeli military said they were members of Islamic Jihad “taking anti-tank guided missiles by car to a launch pad” ahead of a cross-border attack.
Following the morning attack, Islamic Jihad vowed to retaliate, with spokesman Daoud Shehab warning that “the resistance considers that all cities and settlements in the Zionist (Israeli) depths will be under its fire”.
‘Don’t mess with us’
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, whose Islamist movement rules Gaza, said “assassinating the leadership” would bring “greater resistance”.
In remarks ahead of a security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said he had ordered the targeting of the Islamic Jihad leaders following last week’s rocket fire.
“Whoever harms us, will be harmed by us, forcefully,” he said, “at the time and place we choose”. “We are in the midst of a battle and prepared for any scenario. My suggestion to our enemies is — don’t mess with us”. The Israeli military warned residents within 40 kilometres (25 miles) of the Gaza border to stay near bomb shelters until Wednesday evening.
Moscow’s diplomatic mission to the Palestinians said one of the dead was a Russian citizen, a doctor who was killed alongside his wife and one of his children.
Israel last week traded air strikes on Gaza for rocket fire from the enclave, an exchange sparked by the death in Israeli custody of a Palestinian hunger striker with ties to Islamic Jihad, which ended with an Egypt-brokered truce.
Islamic Jihad charged on Tuesday that Israel had “scorned all the initiatives of mediators” and vowed it would “avenge the leaders” killed in the latest air strikes.
The group said Ghannam was secretary of the Al-Quds Brigades military council, Bahtini the military commander in northern Gaza, and Ezzedine a military leader in the West Bank who operated from Gaza.
The Israeli military described Ghannan as “one of the most senior members” of Islamic Jihad who had coordinated weapons and money transfers with Hamas.
Bahtini was “responsible for the rocket fire toward Israel in the past month”, the army said.
And Ezzedine, who was released from Israeli detention in a 2011 prisoner exchange, was involved in attempts to set up abilities to fire rockets from the occupied West Bank into Israel, according to Hagari, the military spokesman.
‘Treacherous operation’
UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was “deeply alarmed” by the latest violence and described the killing of civilians as “unacceptable”.
 






Jordan said it was taking steps to “immediately stop this dangerous escalation”.
Israel told a UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva it was justified in carrying out what it labelled Operation Shield and Arrow, which it said followed “months of attacks against Israeli citizens”.
“Israel directs these attacks only against military targets and takes all feasible precautions to mitigate harm to civilians,” said Avishai Kaplan, with the military’s International Law Department.
Israel and Gaza militants have fought multiple wars since Hamas took control of the enclave in 2007.
Following Tuesday’s air strikes, Egypt stated its “total rejection of such attacks” which it said “inflame the situation in a way that could get out of control in the occupied Palestinian territories”. The Gaza deaths bring to 123 the number of Palestinians killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so far this year.
Nineteen Israelis, one Ukrainian and one Italian have been killed over the same period, according to an AFP count based on official sources from the two sides.

1,"Ukraine peace talks ‘not possible’ right now, says UN chief",Chinese FM says Beijing would maintain lines of communication with all parties to the war in Ukraine in seeking a ceasefire.," 

RESIDENTS stand inside an apartment that came under attack during a Russian missile strike in Dnipro, Ukraine, on Tuesday.—Reuters

CUACOS: UN Chief Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday peace negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine were “not possible at this moment,” but as China pushes to act as a mediator Foreign Minister Qin Gang is visiting Europe this week.
In an interview published by the Spanish newspaper El Pais, Guter­res said he hoped it was possible “in the future” to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. But “It is clear that the (two) parties are completely absorbed in this war” and “are convinced that they can win”.
On Tuesday, Guterres received the Carlos V European Award, given to individuals or organisations that have contributed to the enhancement of Europe’s cultural and historical values or to EU integration.
 






Beijing would maintain lines of communication with all parties to the war in Ukraine, including Ger­many, in seeking a ceasefire, Qin Gang said.
“As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and responsible major country, China will neither watch the fire from the other bank nor add fuel to the fire,” Qin said alongside German counterpart Annalena Baerbock during a visit to Berlin.
The United States announced a new $1.2 billion security assistance package for Ukraine to boost the country’s air defences and provide it with additional artillery ammunition.
The package underscores the continued US commitment to Ukraine “by committing critical near-term capabilities, such as air defence systems and munitions, while also building the capacity of Ukraine’s armed forces to defend its territory and deter Russian aggression over the long term,” the Defence Department said in a statement.

2,Top lawyers’ bodies resolve dispute after matter lands in SC,"Apex court orders withdrawal of cases filed by SCBA, PBC against each other.","ISLAMABAD: The impasse between two premier lawyer bodies finally ended on a good note and the Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the withdrawal of all actions taken by the parties against each other with consent.
Before the court hearing, a meeting between the representatives of the two bodies — the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), the regulator of the lawyers’ fraternity, and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), the prestigious bar — was also held in which a consensus was reached that both sides would go back from their stated positions.
The Supreme Court bench hearing the case comprised Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Shahid Waheed. It had taken up an SCBA petition challenging the PBC’s decision to issue show-cause notices and de-seat the bar’s secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir and additional secretary Malik Shakeelur Rehman.
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mazhar inquired from the chairman of PBC’s executive committee, Hassan Raza Pasha, and SCBA President Abid Zuberi and Ahsan Bhoon from Lahore via a video link about any possibility of an amicable solution to resolve the dispute.

Apex court orders withdrawal of cases filed by SCBA, PBC against each other

Mr Pasha and senior PBC member Qalbe Hassan told the court that before coming to the bench, representatives of the two bodies met to reach a settlement.
The order stated that PBC representatives had agreed to withdraw the decision of de-seating the two senior SCBA office-bearers forthwith.
In return, the SCBA president undertook to withdraw within a week three suits the association filed before the Sindh High Court against 10 of its 17-member executive committee. A proper application will be filed before the high court.
Likewise, all the decisions and minutes of SCBA meetings from Feb 24 till date would also be withdrawn, including the one in which it was decided that Ahsan Bhoon and not Mr Zuberi would represent the association before the Supreme Court in the suo motu hearing held on the holding of elections to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Moreover, the minutes adopted in a subsequent meeting overruling the earlier minutes also stand cancelled under orders. Now the SCBA president will convene a fresh meeting in accordance with the rules.
When the court was asked to order that the SCBA meeting should be called by the president, Justice Mazhar regretted that it was a sorry state of affairs if the president did not enjoy his mandate and could not even call the meeting.
During the hearing, the attention of the court was drawn towards certain correspondence of SCBA’s Finance Secretary Hifsa Bukhari — a member of the majority group — to the Habib Bank Ltd regarding the accounts of the association would also be withdrawn by the finance secretary by Wednesday.
A May 4 resolution in which the majority group had suspended seven minority members, including the SCBA president, will also be withdrawn forthwith.
Similarly, notices issued on May 5 to SCBA employees by the majority group to explain non-compliance with the orders issued by them also stand withdrawn.
Mr Pasha assured the court that the PBC would honour whatever commitment had been made before the court.
Justice Malik asked the representatives of the two groups to work for the bigger cause and while pointing towards Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan — who happens to be the ex-officio chairman of the PBC — that he was witness to the compromise and it was his burden that the settlement should be honoured.
Justice Malik also asked the PBC that being a regulator, it should pacify the situation and should treat the SCBA equally to achieve harmony.

3,"Sudanese war displaced double to more than 700,000: UN","In addition to the internally displaced, another 150,000 have fled to neighbouring countries, the UN refugee agency says.","KHARTOUM: The war between Sudan’s generals is having increasingly severe consequences for civilians, with a doubling over the past week of the number uprooted from their homes, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
Hundreds have already been killed in the fighting but new worries emerged as separate ethnic clashes claimed at least 16 lives in the country’s south, and a powerful group in the east, an area so far untouched by the war, demonstrated in support of the army.
More than 700,000 people are now internally displaced by battles which are now in their fourth week, Paul Dillon, spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration, said in Geneva.
“Last Tuesday, the figure stood at 340,000.” An increasing number are also crossing borders to escape the battles between the army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy-turned rival Mohamed Hamdan Daglo who commands the heavily armed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Fighting has been concentrated in the capital Khartoum but other areas, particularly the western Darfur region bordering Chad, have also seen heavy fighting.
In addition to the internally displaced, another 150,000 have fled to neighbouring countries, the UN refugee agency said on Monday.
Those left behind in the war zones face shortages of water, electricity, food and medical care in a country where, according to the UN, about one-third of the population needed humanitarian assistance even before fighting began.
Foreign-led evacuations by land, sea and air have seen the departure of thousands of other people, many of them from the Red Sea city of Port Sudan, which has so far been peaceful.
But a demonstration on Monday in support of the army, which some called on to arm civilians, raised alarms in a country already marked by a history of ethnic unrest.
“We, all of us the Beja, are ready to be armed and to protect the land and our honour,” said Mahmoud al-Bishary, a Beja member, in a speech during the rally.
Such sentiment could signal even more problems for Sudan, where analysts see a protracted fight between the generals.

4,"Canada, China expel envoys in escalating row",They follow an outcry in Canada over allegations that Chinese intelligence had planned to target MP Michael Chong in Hong Kong with sanctions.,"SHANGHAI: China said on Tuesday it was expelling Canada’s consul in Shanghai, in a tit-for-tat move after Ottawa announced it was sending home a Chinese diplomat accused of trying to intimidate a lawmaker.
The expulsions have plunged the two nations into a fresh diplomatic row after years of souring relations.
They follow an outcry in Canada over allegations that Chinese intelligence had planned to target MP Michael Chong and his relatives in Hong Kong with sanctions for sponsoring a motion condemning Beijing’s conduct in the Xinjiang region as genocide.
In response, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said Toronto-based Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei — who allegedly played a role in the scheme — would have to leave the country.
The Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday condemned the decision to expel Zhao, and said it had ordered Canadian consul Jennifer Lynn Lalonde to leave the country by May 13.
“As a reciprocal countermeasure in reaction to Canada’s unscrupulous move, China decides to declare Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, consul of the Consulate General of Canada in Shanghai, persona non grata,” the ministry said in a statement.
And foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin urged Canada to stop “unreasonable provocations”.
A single police car was seen parked outside the Shanghai office building where the consulate is based.
Inside, appointments appeared to be running as normal, and staff at reception said they were unaware of Tuesday’s developments.
Neither Canada’s foreign ministry nor its embassy in Beijing replied to requests for comment from AFP.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced growing pressure to take a hard line on China following revelations in recent months that it sought to sway Canada’s 2019 and 2021 elections in his party’s favour.

5,"US, UK back ‘rule of law’ in Pakistan after ex-PM’s arrest",UN says it’s monitoring political situation in country; Amnesty International calls upon authorities to show restraint.,"WASHINGTON: The top diplomats of the United States and Britain together called on Tuesday for adherence to the “rule of law” in Pakistan after former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest triggered nationwide violence.
“We just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law, with the constitution,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a joint news conference in Washington.
Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, speaking alongside Blinken, noted that Britain enjoyed “a longstanding and close relationship” with Commonwealth member Pakistan. “We want to see peaceful democracy in that country. We want to see the rule of law adhered to,” Cleverly said.
Both declined to comment in further detail, with Cleverly saying he had not been fully briefed on the situation.

UN says it’s monitoring political situation in the country

“As we have said before, the United States does not have a position on one political candidate or party versus another,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said when asked about the situation in Pakistan.
Fair treatment
The United Nations said on Tuesday that it would monitor the political situation in Pakistan following Imran Khan’s arrest to make sure that all political figures in the country were treated fairly, Anwar Iqbal in Washington adds.
“Our concern is making sure that all of the political figures in Pakistan are treated fairly and, of course, that the due process is followed,” said deputy spokesman for the UN Secretary-General Farhan Haq when asked to comment on Imran Khan’s arrest.
“So, we will follow this process as it goes on to make sure that our concerns are being addressed,” Mr Haq added while addressing a Tuesday afternoon news briefing at the UN headquarters in New York.
In Washington, Amnesty International, a London-based rights group, shared a statement issued by its headquarters. “The clashes unfolding between Imran Khan’s supporters and security enforcement following the former prime minister’s arrest risk several human rights violations,” Amnesty warned in its statement.
“We call upon authorities to show restraint, and ensure any response is in line with the principles of proportionality, legality, necessity, and non-discrimination,” it added.
 






 






Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, noted in a tweet that the situation in Pakistan was getting messier day by day.
“Today it appears the Pakistan army has reached an ‘enough-is-enough’ moment re Khan. After several false starts/unsuccessful arrest attempts by the police, this time the mil took matters into its own hands,” he wrote. “What a mess!”
 






 






Jeremy McLellan, a social media personality who often comments on events in Pakistan, claimed in his tweet that “Imran Khan wasn’t arrested, he was illegally kidnapped … because he got too popular”.
“The Pakistani people will not take this lying down,” he warned.
 






Madiha Afzal, another scholar of South Asian affairs associated with the Brookings Institution, Washington, pointed out that “while things unravel in Pakistan, PM Shehbaz Sharif has stayed on in London for one more day “on [his brother] Nawaz’s instructions” — as per the information minister.
 






Zalmay Khalilzad, a former US diplomat who negotiated the peace deal with the Taliban, also commented on the situation following Iran Khan’s arrest.
“The arrest of Imran Khan is deplorable and will have far-ranging consequences. I condemn it in the strongest terms,” he wrote in a tweet. “It’s painful to watch a country so rich in potential, with an ancient heritage of culture, natural resources, an entrepreneurial spirit and hard-working people, repeatedly be thrown into chaos by its own dysfunctional elites — civilian and military — with some exceptions.”
He also urged Pakistan’s allies — like China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE — to step in and help defuse the situation. “Countries with strong ties to Pakistan must help its leaders reach an agreement that averts the imminent meltdown,” he wrote.
