0,Imran likely to be in NAB custody for ‘four to five days’,Accountability watchdog justifies PTI chairman’s arrest through Rangers.,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan, who was arrested on Tuesday, is likely to remain under the custody of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for four to five days, as the bureau requests the court for his maximum remand allowed under the law.
A NAB source told Dawn on Tuesday that Mr Khan will be presented before the accountability court today (Wednesday).
“We will do our best to keep him under custody for at least four to five days,” the source said.
Under new amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, the duration of physical remand has been cut from 90 days to 14 days, granted by any court.
 
 

“We will seek the maximum physical remand of 14 days from the court,” he said, adding that the court was expected to grant at least four to five days remand.

Accountability watchdog justifies PTI chairman’s arrest through Rangers

When asked about the condition of the PTI chief, the source said Mr Khan was detained in NAB’s Rawalpindi/Islamabad regional headquarters “in a comfortable atmosphere”.
Mr Khan will not be “treated harshly”, rather he will only be questioned regarding his alleged involvement in the case and seeking monetary benefits.
In an official statement, the bureau has also given the details about the case against Mr Khan.
‘Lawful arrest’
The anti-graft watchdog has also justified Mr Khan’s arrest with the help of Rangers from inside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises on Tuesday and termed it legal and purely according to the NAB laws.
“NAB arrested former prime minister Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case. The case relates to illegal acquisition of land and construction for Al-Qadir University involving unlawful benefit given in recovery of prime proceeds (190 million pounds) through National Crime Agency, UK,” the statement said.
“The arrest has been made after fulfilling the lawful procedures of inquiry and investigation conducted by NAB,” the anti-graft watchdog asserted.
It said during the process of inquiry/investigation, several notices were issued to Mr Khan and his wife as they were the trustees of Al-Qadir Trust.
“However, none of the call-up notices was responded to by the former prime minister or his wife.”
Meanwhile, the NAB is also out to arrest other alleged characters in the Al-Qadir University and Trust case — in which Mr Khan was arrested — and has completed the process to issue a red warrant through Interpol to arrest Mr Khan’s former adviser on accountability, Shehzad Akbar.
 
 

The name statement accused Mr Akbar of being “the key person” in the case.
“He [Mr Akbar] and the former prime minister misled the federal cabinet by concealing the documents related to the settlement agreement. Money was received under the settlement agreement and was supposed to be deposited in the national exchequer,” it added.
The NAB statement said the process of issuing of Red notice against former adviser Shehzad Akbar, who is absconding, has already been initiated.
During the inquiry, NAB served notices to as many as 21 PTI leaders, who were part of the federal cabinet when the summary to deposit the money in the Supreme Court’s account was approved.  These members included Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Murad Saeed, Pervez Khattak, Shafqat Mahmood, Shireen Mazari, Ali Zaidi and Hammad Azhar.
According to the media reports NAB had earlier summoned real estate tycoon Malik Riaz and other beneficiaries. According to a NAB’s notice, Mr Riaz had been asked to appear before a combined investigation team on Dec 1 last year at the bureau’s Rawalpindi headquarters.
It said the inquiry into allegations of misuse of authority, financial gains and criminal breach of trust had revealed that Ali Riaz Malik and others entered into an out-of-court settlement agreement with Britain’s National Crime Agency for the repatriation of funds to the government of Pakistan.
“Moreover, M/s Bahria Town donated land measuring 458 acres, four marlas and 58 square feet, situated at Mauza Barkala, Tehsil Sohawa, District Jhelum, for Al Qadir Trust University. Therefore, you are in possession of information /evidence whatsoever, which relates to the commission of the said offence(s),” the notice added.
Mr Riaz was asked to furnish a complete record of the agreement through which the land was donated to Al Qadir Trust.
In his press conference on Tuesday following the arrest, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah also accused Mr Khan and his wife of accepting Rs5bn and hundreds of kanals of land from Bahria Town for protecting the real estate firm in a money laundering case. He alleged that Mr Khan’s government extended the property tycoon a favour by protecting the Rs50bn repatriated to Pakistan.
After that, Mr Riaz allotted 458 kanals of land, with an on-paper value of Rs530m, to a trust owned by the PTI chief and his wife.
The minister had said another 240 kanals were transferred to Farah Shehzadi, commonly known as Farah and believed to be a close friend of Mr Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi.In March 2022, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed, accepted a settlement of Rs460bn offered by Bahria Town, after the court found that the land acquired by the company for its housing society was illegal.

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: The PTI leadership has strongly condemned the arrest of party chairman Imran Khan, announced a countrywide strike on Wednesday (today) and appealed to the nation to come out onto the streets against the ‘rising fascism’ telling supporters that a ‘make or break moment’ has approached.
However, the senior leadership also announced that the schedule of public meetings across the country, approved by Mr Khan days before his arrest, would remain unchanged.
Hours after the arrest, PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi convened a meeting of the ‘emergency committee’ comprising Senators Saifullah Khan, Azam Swati and Ejaz Chaudhry, PTI senior leaders Murad Saeed, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur and Hassan Niazi to review the situation from every aspect and announce a comprehensive plan of action.
Also, PTI Central Secretary General Asad Umar said Mr Qureshi-led seven-member committee, which was formed by Mr Khan, would announce party’s plan of action after Pakistan’s biggest political leader was arrested. “The whole world is being shown there is no law left in the country,” he remarked. The vice chairman, meanwhile, urged people to come out in support of Mr Khan who was “abducted” from the court premises in a “false and fabricated” case.
‘Pre-planned attack’
At Karachi airport before catching a flight to Islamabad, Mr Qureshi told reporters that the arrest was connected with the London visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, alleging that it was “a pre-planned attack” by the government on the ex-premier and warned of strong protest against the “illegal move”.
Mr Qureshi rejected the reports of violence amid street protests by the PTI and said public wrath was invited by the government. “The people are protesting on their own,” he said in response to a question. “The people of Pakistan across the country took to the street to protest the arrest of Imran Khan. They are peaceful and only want their beloved leader’s safety.”
And it didn’t happen suddenly, he said, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended his London stay as he knew this [arrest plan of Imran Khan] very well. “The arrest of Imran Khan is somehow connected with London [visit of Shehbaz Sharif],” the vice chairman said, adding that even well before his appearance before the court Mr Khan in a video statement announced “he’s ready for arrest”.
‘Rangers attacked IHC, abducted Imran’
PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said that former prime minister was “abducted” from court premises where “scores of lawyers and general people were tortured”. He urged the people to come out of their homes, as “IHC had been attacked”.
Also, PTI senior vice president Shireen Mazari said the court was attacked by the Rangers personnel as if they were invading an occupied land, while lawyers and IHC staff had been thrashed. 
‘Life in danger’
PTI Central Secretary Information Farrukh Habib said Mr Khan sacrificed everything for ‘true freedom’ of the people and it was nation’s turn to take to the streets for his early release.
He also said it was a real test for IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, because Mr Khan came to appear in his court when he was ‘abducted’ from court premises. He feared Mr Khan’s life was in danger.
Mr Habib said the Abdul Qadir University was an educational institution and there was nothing in the name of Imran Khan or Bushra Bibi.
PTI senior leader Murad Saeed asked the masses to bring the whole country’s machinery to a grinding halt, as it was decisive moment when the Muslim ummah’s leader was ‘detained and tortured’.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen, an ally of the PTI, also announced all-out support to the anti-government protests against Mr Khan’s arrest.  
Protest outside Nawaz’s flat
In London, the party’s supporters gathered outside Avenfield House, the Park Lane residence of PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif. 
On Tuesday evening, scores of PTI’s UK supporters had poured into Dunraven Street, the street leading to the gated apartment block where Mr Sharif and members of his family reside, and shouted anti-Nawaz slogans.

2,Imran repeats allegations against senior army officer,"LAHORE: PTI chief Imran Khan on Tuesday doubled down on his allegations against a serving senior military officer,...","LAHORE: PTI chief Imran Khan on Tuesday doubled down on his allegations against a serving senior military officer, who he has accused on several occasions of hatching a plot to assassinate him, Dawn.com reported.  
The PTI chairman made the remarks ahead of departing for Islamabad to appear before the Islamabad High Court, from where he was later arrested.
His biting rejoinder comes a day after an ISPR statement a day ago conde­mning “irresponsible and baseless allegations” by Mr Khan. In a video message shared on Tuesday, Mr Khan replied to the ISPR and “attempts by PDM and their handlers” regarding his arrest.
“Before I leave, I want to say two things. Firstly, the ISPR has issued a statement that the institution has been disrespected — the army has been disrespected [by] naming an intelligence officer that has tried to kill me twice.
“ISPR sahib, listen to me carefully. Respect is not [confined] to a single institution; respect should be for every single citizen,” he said.
He highlighted that he was the chief of the country’s “largest” political party, adding that he did not need to lie.
“This man tried to kill me twice and whenever an investigation is carried out, I will prove that it was this man and there is a whole gang with him,” he said, adding that the nation was well aware of who was standing with the officer.

3,PML-N celebrates arrest,PPP leader says party believes in equality of all before law,"LAHORE: The PML-N on Tuesday celebrated the arrest of PTI chief Imran Khan.
PML-N Lahore president Saiful Malook Khok­har held a celebration at his Khokhar Palace in Jauhar Town. He organised the event at the time when PTI supporters were holding demonstrations in several parts of the city. 
Khokhar and other party workers distributed sweets and termed Imran Khan’s arrest a good omen for the country’s politics. 
In another event, PML-N’s Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman held a ceremony at the party office and distributed sweets among the participants. 
Minister of State for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Faisal Karim Kundi, while reacting to Imran Khan’s arrest on Tuesday, said the  PPP believed in the equality of all before the law, according to APP.

PPP leader says party believes in equality of all before law

Talking to a private news channel, he said that if Imran Khan believed that he was innocent, he should pursue legal ways to prove it. 
Federal Minister for Climate Change and PPP leader Sherry Rehman berated Imran Khan for levelling concocted accusations against senior military and intelligence officers. In a series of tweets, the minister said PTI chief’s accusations against serving military and intelligence agency officials were regrettable and condemnable. 
Reacting to the arrest of Imran Khan, Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Sirajul Haq said that no one was above the law. However, the JI has a clear stance that the political victimisation in the name of accountability was unjustified and unfair. 
The JI, he said, deman­ded across the board accountability. He also expressed doubt about the continuation of dialogue among political parties on elections after the arrest of PTI chairman Imran Khan. He said the political environment has become tense after Khan’s arrest. 
The NAB, he said, had already lost credibility and there was a dire need for not repeating the past mistakes of targeting people or political leaders without any credible proof of corruption or malpractices.

The scholarships will enable students to learn courses part of Google Career Certificates (GCC). The programme was launched last year.
The announcement was made at an event on Tues­day which was also atten­ded by IT and Tele­com­mu­nication Minister Syed Aminul Haque.

5,Arshad Sharif’s killing: SC angry over release of initial report,Chief justice orders AGP to furnish reports supported with documents.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed displeasure over release to the media of the initial report of a fact-finding committee into the killing of journalist Arshad Sharif.
“This was done deliberately,” regretted Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, adding that people were careless and negligent in the execution of their duty.
The CJP asked Attorney General (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan to take up the matter with the authorities concerned so that the person behind the release of the report was found out.
The report was leaked probably by those who retain its possession, Justice Bandial observed.
The observations came after the AGP explained that the Kenyan authorities were upset over release of the findings.
The court is playing the role of a facilitator since Arshad Sharif was a well-known journalist, the CJP said, adding the court would protect journalists because freedom of expression was a fundamental right under the Constitution.
Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi said it was the court’s responsibility to ensure justice was done in the case.
Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman told the court the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore had concluded that unsigned report was released to the media and not the five signed ones.
The fact-finding report had concluded that the murder of journalist Arshad Sharif was a “planned, targeted assassination” which purportedly involved “transnational characters”.
The CJP observed the fact-finding report actually did bring material and even interviewed the persons accused of the killing by reaching out to them. “But then Kenyan authorities became non-responsive and non-cooperative,” the CJP regretted.
Before adjourning further proceedings to June 13, the CJP ordered the AGP to furnish reports supported with documents. He also said it must be ensured that a limited number of people visit Kenya since the country was short of foreign exchange.
The AGP was asked to carry out research for engaging the best Kenyan counsel within a limited budget for trial at Kenyan courts.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar said the report should include a request to Interpol to issue red warrants against two Pakistani hosts in Kenya — Waqar and Khurram, request for Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) to Kenya and information regarding progress of investigation against those involved in the killing.
Justice Ijazul Ahsan wondered whether the FIA had started the process to ensure that red warrants were issued by Interpol for the arrest of two Pakistanis in Kenya who had hosted the journalist.
Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, representing the mother and the first wife of Arshad Sharif, requested the court to allow him to read the fact-finding report as well as reports by the SJIT.
The attorney general assured the court that SJIT would leave for Kenya on May 17, but not before getting assurance of cooperation by Kenyan authorities.
When Justice Mazhar wondered whether any proceedings had been initiated against the two Kenyan police officials said to have been involved in the assassination of Arshad Shari.
The AGP replied that Kenyan authorities had initiated trial against police officials after charging them with for manslaughter.

6,Govt blocks internet to ‘stop violence’,"""The data service has been stopped as it was helping spread violence across the country,"" the spokesperson said.","ISLAMABAD: Mobile internet and major social media platforms were shut down on Tuesday after videos began to emerge of arson and violence during protests against the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
All four cellular mobile companies — Jazz, Zong4G, Telenor and Ufone — were directed by the telecom regulator, Pakistan Telecommuni­cation Authority (PTA), to suspend data service.
A PTA spokesperson confirmed that the directive has been issued to the cellular mobile companies after a written request from the Ministry of Interior.
The data service has been stopped as it was helping spread violence across the country, the spokesperson said.
The decision was taken after social media was flooded with footage of a mob clashing with police in Karachi, attacking and entering the army’s head office GHQ in Rawalpindi and vandalising the official residence of a high-ranking military officer in Lahore.
Panic gripped several parts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi in the evening as data services were suspended and many areas witnessed power shutdown too at the same time.
While fixed-line broadband was functioning and no directives were issued by the regulator in this regard, the authorities had slowed Twitter and YouTube platforms to considerable levels.
An internet service provider said that service disruption was not only witnessed in major cities but also in smaller cities like D.I. Khan and Mardan.
The international monitor NetBlocks, which tracks internet disruptions, confirmed that the services of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube were affected on multiple ISPs in Pakistan on Tuesday.
“Additionally, total internet shutdowns have been observed in some regions,” NetBlocks anno­u­nced on its Twitter account.
It added that in addition to social media restrictions, real-time network data show total internet shutdowns in some regions accross the country.
However, other websites, including those of news media, could be acce­ssed on fixed line internet networks, it added.
