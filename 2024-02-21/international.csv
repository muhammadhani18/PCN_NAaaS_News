0,No let-up in Balochistan ‘poll fraud’ protests,"In addition to four-party alliance, ANP and PNAB also stage demonstrations in Quetta, Chaman","Widespread protests persist against alleged poll rigging in Quetta and other regions of Balochistan, marking a significant escalation in unrest. The four-party alliance comprising Baloch, Pashtun, and Hazara nationalist parties has maintained a sit-in outside the deputy commissioner’s office in Quetta, denouncing the purported election irregularities.
“We refuse to relent until our demands are addressed,” declared Haji Atta Muhammad Bangulzai, a prominent leader of the National Party (NP), who claims victory in a provincial assembly seat from the Sariab Road Quetta constituency. Notably, women are actively participating in the protest demonstration, underscoring the widespread discontent.
The alliance, consisting of Balochistan National Party (Mengal), Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party (NP), and Hazara Democratic Party (HDP), has issued ultimatums to the Election Commission of Pakistan and returning officers across the province, warning of intensified protests if their demands are not met.
In a separate demonstration, supporters of the Pashtoonkhwa National Awami Party (PNAP) marched through Quetta’s streets, decrying the alleged overturning of Khushal Khan Kakar’s victory in NA 251 Zhob, Killa Saifullah, by the returning officer.

“Our candidate’s triumph in NA 251 was unjustly nullified,” asserted Raza Muhammad Raza, a central leader of PNAP, amidst fervent flag-waving. The protest rally, originating from Jinnah Road, converged into a sizable demonstration at Bacha Khan Chowk, with attendees vociferously condemning the Election Commission of Pakistan and the returning officer.
Their primary demand is the immediate issuance of the victory notification for Khushal Khan Kakar in NA 251. Simultaneously, the Awami National Party (ANP) mobilized in protest against alleged election malpractices in Chaman, led by provincial president Asghar Khan Achakzai, who criticized the returning officer and ECP for purportedly overturning his electoral success.
Additionally, the Sibi Ittehad and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) organized protests in Sibi, Naseerabad, and Loralai, demanding the prompt issuance of victory notifications for their respective candidates.
These protests, ongoing since February 9, have brought Balochistan to a virtual standstill, as major highways remained blocked, underscoring the deep-seated frustration and discontent among the populace regarding the integrity of the electoral process.
On February 15, at least two people were killed and around a dozen injured during an exchange of fire between two rival political groups in the Hub city of Balochistan as police failed to bring the situation under control.
A peaceful protest in PB-21 against alleged result changes in the general elections turned violent. Chaos erupted on the national highway near the Civic Center, resulting in the loss of two lives and injuries to around a dozen people in a gunfight between two groups.
