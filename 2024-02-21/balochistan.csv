2,Shooting probe unveils connections,Deceased shooter’s long-standing ties to prime accused lead to multiple arrests,"Investigations into the recent shooting incident at a private housing society during a wedding ceremony have revealed startling connections between the deceased shooter and prime accused individuals Khawaja Aqeel alias Gogi Butt and Khawaja Tareef Gulshan alias Teefi Butt, who have been long-term employers of the deceased.
Muzzafar Hussain, the deceased shooter, was found to have been in possession of two mobile phones, with one of the SIM cards reportedly registered under the name of a woman from Karachi.
The SIM card was acquired by Hussain on February 17, a day prior to the murder.
Further investigations led a police team to Karachi, where three suspects allegedly linked to the issuance of the SIM card were taken into custody.
Simultaneously, police conducted raids at the residences of the prime accused persons in Gowalmandi, Naseerabad, and a private housing society on Canal Road.
It was discovered that Gogi Butt had been present in Lahore at the time of the incident but quickly fled to Karachi within hours of the murder, and subsequently travelled abroad.
The police probe extended to various individuals present at the wedding ceremony, including Sub-Inspector Shakeel Butt of the Organized Crime Unit (OCU) in Iqbal Town, Lahore.

Butt had attended the ceremony alongside Ameer Balaj Tipu, the victim of the shooting. Additionally, Butt’s presence at the Allama Iqbal International Airport during the murder of Tipu Truckanwala 14 years ago raised suspicions.
However, a spokesperson for the OCU, Malik Asad, denied reports of Shakeel Butt’s arrest, stating that Butt had attended the event as a guest in his personal capacity. Meanwhile, the fourth wife of the deceased shooter, Muzzafar Hussain, has been included in the investigation after contacting the police through legal representation to claim her husband’s body.
To expedite the investigation process, six teams from Lahore police, including operations, investigations, and the organised crime unit, have been formed.
These teams are actively pursuing leads and evidence, such as Call Data Records (CDRs), geo-fencing data, and CCTV footage.
Additionally, a suspect driving a Black Vigo vehicle, spotted rushing out of the housing society where the incident occurred, is under scrutiny.
The vehicle, suspected to have been used by the deceased shooter’s accomplices to flee the crime scene, is being traced by the police.

3,PFA launches milk traceability system,Programme initially rolled out in 10 tehsils,"The Punjab Food Authority has introduced a ‘milk traceability system’ in 10 tehsils of the province to trace the product from the farms to stores and homes.
PFA Director General Muhammad Asim Javaid briefed the media on Tuesday about the system, its execution as well as registration of milk carrier vehicles.
He said the system was meant to keep track of where the milk comes from, how it's processed and how it reaches homes. “This way, we can ensure that the milk we use is safe, clean and up to the standards set by the authority,” he said.
In the first phase, the PFA has selected the 10 tehsils of Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Multan, Sahiwal and Bahawalpur for the programme.

The DG said it would be compulsory for milk suppliers to register with the PFA by the end of March. All milk tankers, chillers, pick-ups, bikes and rickshaws will be registered under the traceability system.
He termed the system a big step towards ensuring consumer confidence and promoting transparency in the dairy industry, which would also add value to their products.
He said complete record of the daily milk supply of the registered milkmen and suppliers would be maintained.
Muhammad Asim said that more than 400 million litres of milk had been checked across the province since 2017. The PFA discarded 8.24 million litres of substandard and adulterated milk.

4,Govt fails to respect job quotas,"Differently-abled people, transgender persons have not been recruited despite the announcement of reserved seats","In an attempt to appease foreign and local human rights groups, the government has time and again announced special quotas for civil service positions for differently-abled persons however, poor implementation and a lack of dedication towards reserving the seats has meant that thousands of aspiring candidates for government jobs remain at fortunes mercy.
Zakia Parveen, a government job aspirant from Lahore, has suffered from polio since childhood due to which her physical mobility is constrained, and she has to use a wheelchair. Her husband too lives with hearing and speech impairment. “I have passed the intermediate exam and have been trying for a government job since several years but have not been successful,” lamented Zakia, who further claimed that thousands of differently-abled people like her had been unsuccessful in securing a government job despite having the necessary education, skills and ability.
“As per data from the World Health Organization, 15 to 20 percent of Pakistan’s total population comprises of people suffering from some kind of disability. But, unfortunately, the quota of jobs for special persons is only 3 per cent,” revealed Wajid Hussain, President of the Rights of Special Persons Welfare Foundation (ROSP), who was of the opinion that a lack of awareness and facilities for the special needs of differently-abled persons had aggravated their isolation from paid employment.
“Transportation is a big problem for differently-abled persons and half their salary is spent on commute only,” added Hussain.

“Differently-abled persons require a disability certificate to get a job, but it is very difficult to obtain this certificate since only one hospital, the Services Hospital, issues it in the city. It takes the whole day for many differently-abled persons to reach there and wait for their turn,” explained Syeda Imtiaz Fatima, founder of the Independent Living Home.
According to a report obtained by the Express Tribune from the Pakistan Public Administration Research Center, Establishment Division for the year 2021-22, the number of differently-abled persons recruited under the two percent quota in federal departments was only 1704 while the total number of federal employees was 575,354. Furthermore, despite the reservation of the 3 per cent quota, more than 150 reserved seats in Punjab were vacant, while no reserved seats quota existed for the transgender community.
Zanaya Chaudhry, a trans rights activist, working as a contractual Victim Support Officer for the Punjab Police confirmed that no quota was fixed for the transgender community in government jobs. “A major reason behind this is that most educated transgender persons, including myself have had their gender written as male on their educational certificates. Even though, I was able to change my gender officially, most people are unable to do so since the process is long, complicated and costly,” shared Zanaya.
Speaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, Punjab Social Protection Authority’s (PSWA) Vice-Chairperson Jahan Ara Watto said, “The Labor Department is working to ensure that the 3 per cent quota allocated for special persons is respected in government employment, The biggest problem for people with disabilities is the lack of basic training, education, technical skills, access to infrastructure, transport and proper medical care facilities.
