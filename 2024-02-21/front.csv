0,PDM 2.0 set in,"Shehbaz-Zardari to reclaim highest offices of PM, president","The Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz finally cooked up a deal on Tuesday night to once again sew together a coalition government in the Centre – ending ten days of intense negotiations after an inconclusive national election failed to crown a clear winner.
The parties reached a consensus on splitting up the power pie, deciding on crucial positions including prime minister, president, governorships, and chairman Senate.
Under the power-sharing recipe, Shehbaz Sharif is set to assume the role of prime minister once again, while Asif Ali Zardari will reoccupy the presidential chair.
In addition, a PML-N leader confirmed that the PPP is slated to assume the roles of Senate chairman and Punjab governor, while the governors in both Sindh and Balochistan will belong to PML-N.
Following much uncertainty post-polls, top leaders from both major parties confirmed that they were once again joining forces to form the government “in the nation’s best interest” in their seventh meeting.
The agreement put the brakes on the days of political limbo, potentially resolving the deadlock in the wake of the Feb 8 elections that left the national assembly hanging in the balance.
The development came as despite consecutive meetings, the situation appeared to be slipping out of control when Bilawal, in a press briefing earlier in the day, clearly stated that PPP would cast its vote for PML-N's prime ministerial candidate on its own conditions.
However, by the end of the day, there was a surprising turn of events as Bilawal declared that the PPP would extend support to Shehbaz to become the premier before midnight.

The official declaration that the PPP would cast their votes in favour of Shehbaz for his prime ministerial election, reciprocated by PML-N's support for PPP to secure Zardari as the resident, was announced during a late-night press conference at Zardari House in Islamabad.
Before this public announcement, both sides initially fine-tuned the details of the upcoming coalition government through their respective committees. The finalisation of the modalities took place at the residence of PML-N leader Ishaq Dar on Tuesday, with the top leadership of both parties in attendance.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari confirmed at the conference that former premier Shehbaz Sharif, who was seated beside him, would be the coalition's candidate for prime minister. He added that his father Asif Ali Zardari will be the alliance's candidate for the country's president.

Shehbaz Sharif said the two parties had the numbers to form a government and also had the support of other smaller parties. PML-N is the largest party with 79 seats and PPP is second with 54. They, along with four other smaller parties, have a comfortable majority in the legislature of 264 seats.
The delay in forming a government has caused concern as Pakistan is grappling with an economic crisis amid slow growth and record inflation, rising militant violence, and needs a stable administration with the authority to make tough decisions.
Bhutto Zardari said the parties would push to form a government as soon as possible. According to the country's constitution, a session of parliament has to be called by Feb 29 after which a vote for a new prime minister will take place.
""Pakistan Peoples Party and Muslim League Nawaz now possess the requisite numbers, placing us in a position to establish the forthcoming government,"" stated PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari during a press conference in Islamabad, accompanied by senior leaders from both parties.

With no single political party securing a simple majority in the February 8 elections, alliances became necessary for the pursuit of governmental power. The delay in reaching an agreement had raised concerns.
While negotiations unfolded for government formation, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had formed an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to secure the necessary numbers through reserved seats in the assemblies.
However, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari informed reporters that the SIC lacked sufficient numbers to lead the next central government. He revealed that Shehbaz would be the next prime minister, with Zardari as the joint presidential candidate for both parties.
Emphasising their commitment to resolving the ongoing crises, Bilawal expressed optimism about the ability of both parties to deliver results once in power.

Addressing a question about PML-N leader Ishaq Dar's nomination as Senate chairman, Bilawal explained that decisions were made during meetings and would be announced separately by each party. He highlighted the efficiency of past coalitions and decision-making processes compared to previous tenures.
PPP Co-chairman Zardari assured the public that their struggle aimed to benefit ""you, Pakistan, and the coming generations."" He underscored the consensus within the parties on the need to ensure Pakistan's success for future generations.

1,Rs7.13 per unit power tariff hike in the offing,Proposed increase based on account of FCA for January,"The inflation-stricken nation, already struggling to meet ends meet, braces for another power shock as it anticipates a tariff hike of Rs7.13 per unit on account of fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for the month of January 2024.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) is scheduled to conduct a hearing on February 23 concerning the adjustment of fuel charges for ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) in the last month.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G) has provided a detailed information regarding the actual fuel charges incurred by these companies during January.
Based on this data, the CPPA-G has proposed an increase of Rs.7.1308/kWh over the reference fuel charges for Discos, totalling Rs7.4894/kWh for the last month.
The actual price of electricity stood at a higher rate of Rs14.6 per unit due to power generated through expensive fuel such as high-speed diesel (HSD).
The breakdown reveals varying costs across different generation sources, ranging from Rs11.9213/kWh to Rs45.6066/kWh for HSD.
In January, the CPPA-G unveiled the precise fuel charges incurred by Discos.
The breakdown exposes diverse costs across various generation sources, with hydel at Rs11.9213 per unit.
The share of hydel electricity had dropped to 924Gwh accounting for 11.12 per cent out of the total energy mix.
The canals were closed during January, leading to a massive drop in water releases from dams, resulting in reduced electricity generation.
As of January 31, 2024, Pakistan had a cumulative installed power generation capacity of 46,035 megawatts (MW).
This extraordinary capacity encompasses 28,811MW from thermal sources, 10,635MW from hydroelectric sources, 1,838MW from wind energy, 882MW from solar energy, 249MW from bagasse, and 3,620MW from nuclear power.
However, hydel generation dropped to 924Gwh against a total capacity of 20,635 MW due to closure of canals during the period under review.
The government had to run power plants based on expensive fuel of HSD at a cost of Rs45.6066 per unit to meet the demand of electricity.
Though its share of electricity in total generation was 102Gwh or 1.22 per cent it cost Rs4.6 billion at Rs45.6 per unit. The government had also produced electricity from another expensive fuel of furnace oil at a cost of Rs35.4 per unit.
Furnace oil based plants produced 750.4Gwh at a cost of Rs26.5 billion.
The share of electricity based on imported coal was 6.93 per cent or 576Gwh at a cost of Rs21 per unit. The total cost of electricity stood at Rs12.12 billion.
The electricity was generated with local gas at Rs13.7486/kWh, RLNG at Rs24.2952/kWh, nuclear at Rs1.3281/kWh, and imported Iranian energy at Rs32.8030/kWh.
Various stakeholders will participate in the Nepra hearing to voice objections against the proposed increase in electricity prices.

2,SHC orders restoration of social media apps,CJ Abbasi seeks explanation for internet outage on election day,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) ordered on Wednesday the restoration of all social media apps, including the micorblogging website ‘X’, and sought explanation from the relevant authorities regarding internet outage on the election day.
A two-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, heard the petitions against the shutdown of internet services on the election day. The court expressed concern over the widespread shutdown of internet services during the crucial election period.
The lawyer for the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) informed the court that instructions from the interior ministry had to be implemented, adding that they received the instructions and implemented them.
The government lawyer argued that there were certain legal issues because of which such action had to be taken. The chief justice told the government side to fix the issues before things go out of hands. “You do your job better and we will do our job,” the chief justice remarked.
Amid political, economic and security challenges coupled with rigging allegations arising out of February 8 elections, the government restricted access to ‘X’ – formerly known as Twitter – in the country without giving any reasons.
Media watchdog the Freedom Network termed the internet outage an “undeclared censorship” and held the caretaker government responsible for “violating fundamental rights of citizens”. In a statement it demanded that the public access to the social networking platform must be restored immediately.
During the SHC proceedings, the chief justice highlighted the criticism and allegations of irregularities raised by national and international observers and media outlets. In sarcastic remarks, he addressed the authorities, saying: “You people conducted a very good election. Everyone in the world is hailing it.”
The chief justice further remarked, “You shut down the internet...you did not allow people to contest elections. You people did not allow anyone to run an election campaign,” suggesting that the internet shutdown might have hindered the democratic process.
The court ordered the restoration of all social media apps, including X. It also sought an explanation from the authorities concerned regarding the suspension of internet services on the election day and adjourned the hearing until March 5.
Meanwhile, services of social media platform X (formerly Twitter) have been disrupted for the fifth day today. The platform has been inaccessible since Saturday when former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha held a press conference and accused the chief election commissioner and chief justice of being involved in rigging the general elections.
As the proceedings commenced, Justice Abbasi quipped: “The way you held elections, everyone around the world witnessed it. Even the international media is telling the world how elections were held.”

He noted that the internet was not working “here, there or anywhere”, adding that the services were disrupted everywhere.
“Don’t do this, the public understands who is doing what,” the judge remarked. “Let the whistle of the pressure cooker blow lightly, the more you try to clamp it down the larger the explosion would be,” he warned.
“Who’s going to be president, who’s going to be prime minister, who will get governorship; if this had to happen, why were elections held?” Justice Abbasi asked.
Justice Abbasi said: “What was the need for the elections if positions were to be distributed sitting in a
drawing hall? You people are powerful and can do whatever you want to.”
He further lamented that the courts and all other institutions had lost their respect. “Who is running the country?” the judge asked.
For his part, the PTA counsel said the government had decided to shut down internet and cellular services on Feb 8 over security reservations submitted by provinces.
“A law and order situation in the country was prevented because of this decision,” he claimed, adding that the most important factor was national security.
However, Justice Abbasi said “a joke was made by shutting down the entire country” and highlighted that the Centre was putting the entire blame on provincial governments. He also noted that internet services should be shut down in select areas and not in the entire country if a law and order situation arises.

3,Naqvi's resignation misses its mark,"It is prerogative of SJC to proceed with matter accordingly, reads apex court order","In a majority verdict that will have implications for former Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, the apex court has ruled that if the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has started misconduct proceedings against a judge, these proceedings will continue even if the judge retires or resigns.
""If proceedings have already been initiated by the SJC against a judge, the same shall not abate on his resignation or retirement, as the case may be, during such proceedings. It is the prerogative of the SJC to proceed with the matter accordingly,"" said a short order issued by a five-judge larger bench on Wednesday.
The bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan was hearing an intra-court appeal filed by the government against a Supreme Court verdict that declared that judges who retire or resign do not fall within the ambit of Article 209, which deals with misconduct by superior court judges.
A division bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, had passed this order last year—on June 27, 2023.
Under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, an intra-court appeal can be filed against a Supreme Court order. Such appeals are supposed to be filed within 30 days after a verdict.
However, the government filed the intra-court appeal against the Supreme Court ruling on January 23, 2024—almost seven months later—after Justice Naqvi submitted his resignation while the SJC was concluding misconduct proceedings against him on allegations of financial corruption and manipulation of benches.
In its short order, the Supreme Court condoned the delay by the government in filing the appeal while partially allowing it. The order noted that one member of the larger bench—Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi—disagreed with the majority's decision on the point of ""limitation as well as on merits.""
Earlier, during the proceeding of the case, Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan argued that it is the prerogative of the SJC to take action on misconduct committed by a judge during his service. ""The judiciary guarantees fundamental rights; therefore, it should be independent,"" he said.
Awan said independence of the judiciary will be affected if it avoids accountability of judges. He said under Article 209, only the SJC has the authority to inquire against superior court judges.

""It is not necessary to recommend their removal if judges violate the Code of Conduct. If a judge is suffering from a curable mental illness, the SJC can also grant leave to that judge for treatment. It can also admonish a judge who is not punctual,"" he said.
He said when a complaint is brought before the council, it is necessary to give some opinion on it. Awan said after the retirement of a judge, he may be appointed to constitutional positions such as Chief Election Commissioner, Shariah Court judges, or tribunals.
""It is essential for the council to give its opinion on the allegations against a judge so that appointments can be made on constitutional positions.""
The AGP said judges should be held accountable, but this accountability should not diminish the dignity of the Supreme Court. ""No other institution can take action against judges. For public trust, the SJC should work transparently,"" he added.
One of the amici curiae, Khawaja Haris, said with the retirement or resignation of a judge, the SJC's proceedings become meaningless.
“It is not necessary for a judge to resign only because the allegations against him are true; a judge can also resign if he cannot tolerate the ridicule,” he said.
When one of the judges, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, asked if a judge should not give reasons for his leaving the post in his resignation, Haris said such reason should definitely be cited if the law demands it.
“The purpose of Article 209 is to remove a judge from office. If a judge is not in office, then how can the council proceed with the action? If a judge has retired or resigned, then what recommendation will the council make to the president?” he asked.
When Justice Mandokhail questioned whether the SJC should abruptly terminate its proceedings upon resignation of a judge, Haris replied in the affirmative. ""For example, if a judge resigns on the 11th and the council resumes proceedings on the 12th, then the judge is no longer present.""
Justice Mandokhail said Section 5 of Article 209 states that the SJC can continue proceedings even if a judge is not in office.
“In the case of a judge's resignation or retirement, only the part related to recommending to the president will become irrelevant. Inquiry on a complaint against a judge is necessary. Wouldn't a judge prefer to go home acquitted of the allegations against him?” he noted.
Haris said under the laws of Pakistan, the sentence awarded to a convicted is terminated if he passes away.
When the judge asked as to who can stop the SJC if it decides to take action against a judge, Khawaja Haris replied that the Supreme Court has that authority. He cited the example of Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry case in which the SC stopped the SJC from conducting proceedings.
Another amicus curiae, Akram Sheikh, however, opined that the SJC proceedings should not depend on a judge’s resignation or retirement.
Earlier, Justice Mussarat Hilali, a bench member, cited the example of a judge in Kolkata High Court, noting that misconduct proceedings against the judge did not stop upon her resignation.

4,PTI gambit ahead of reserved allotment,PML-N to bag 19 seats in NA followed by PPP with 11,"The process of allotment of reserved seats for women and minorities to the political parties in the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures has entered its final stage, following the compiling of the results of the recent general polls by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) but the situation has become intriguing after the PTI-backed independent lawmakers, who has just joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), has 93 members in the lower house of parliament as well 84 and 116 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab assemblies, respectively.
As per the Constitution, the reserved seats are allocated to the political parties on the basis of the number of their lawmakers elected on the general seats. For their allocation, the ECP had already received the priority list of candidates from the parties before the February 8 general elections.
The situation this year is different from the previous elections as the largest group of lawmakers are independents, who cannot have the reserved seats.
Barring a few, these independents are backed by the PTI, which was unable contest on its popular electoral symbol of the ‘cricket bat’.
There are a total of 346 reserved seats for women -- 60 in the NA and 66, 29, 26, and 11 in the provincial legislatures of Punjab, Sindh, K-P, and Balochistan.
Similarly, there are 10 reserved seats for minorities in the lower house. Besides, there are eight, nine and three reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Sindh, and Balochistan assemblies.
Based on the current election results, the PML-N is likely to bag 17 reserved seats for women in the NA, 33 in Punjab and one in Balochistan.
Besides, it will also be allocated two reserved seats for minorities in the lower house and four in Punjab.
The PPP will fetch 10 reserved seats in the NA from Sindh as well as a reserved seat each for women and minorities from Punjab in the lower house.
The party will receive 19 reserved seats for women and six for minorities in the Sindh Assembly. In addition, it will bag two reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Assembly as well.
The MQM-P will bag four women's seats in the NA. It will also fetch six seats for women and two for minorities in the Sindh Assembly.
Based on these figures, if the PTI-backed members after their inclusion in the SIC, the party will be allocated 22 reserved seats for women in the NA, 20 in K-P, and 27 in Punjab, beside three seats for minorities.
However, the SIC had neither applied for any reserved seat to the ECP -- a requirement under the law -- nor had it filed a priority list of candidates before the elections.
Also, the ECP has already rejected the Form 33 nominations filed by the PTI candidates for the reserved seats.
Sources said the SIC would apply for the allocation of the reserved seats to the ECP.
In case, the ECP decides against the SIC, those 22 NA and 20 provincial assembly seats might be allocated to the other parties.
According to the lists submitted to the ECP, the PML-N women lawmakers who will take the NA seats include Tahira Aurangzeb, Shaista Pervaiz Malik, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Nuzhat Sadiq, Musarrat Asif, Seema Mohiuddin, Shaza Fatima, Romina Khurshid Alam, Wajiha Qamar, Zaib Jaffar, Kiran Imran, Anusha Rahman, Zahra Wadood Fatemi, Asyia Naz Tanoli, Saba Sadiq, and Farah Naz Akbar.
The party’s nominees to take seats in the Punjab Assembly include Zakia Khan, Ishrat Ashraf, Azma Bokhari, Hina Pervaiz Butt, Salma Saadia, Rahila Naeem, Bushra Anjum, Sania Ashiq, Salma Butt, Kanwal Pervaiz Chaudhry, Mehwish Sultana, Nosheen Adnan, Asma Ehtishamul Haq, Kausar Javed, Uzma Jabeen, Ambreen Ismail, Mumtaz Begum, Sandal Malik Hussain, Rukhsana Kausar, Shazia Rizwan, Motiya Begum, Rabia Naseem Farooqui, Sonia Ashir and Uzma Kardar.
For the PPP, those taking the reserved seats in the NA include Hina Rabbani Khar, Shehla Raza, Shagufta Jumani, Mehreen Razak Bhutto, Naz Baloch, Sharmila Farooqi, Mehtab Akbar Rashdi, Shazia Sobia and Mudassar Sahar Kamran.
Those to take seats in the Sindh Assembly include Seema Khurram, Tanzeela Umm Habiba, Rehana Leghari, Yasmin Shah, Nuzhat Pathan, Syeda Marvi Faseeh, Sadia Javed, Farzana Hanif, Sajila, Hina Dastgir, Rukhsana Parvez, Nida Khoro, Saima Agha, Ruma Sabat, Arooba Rabbani, Khairun Nisa and Maleeha Manzoor.
The MQM-P's top list for the NA includes Asia Ishaq Siddiqui, Nighat Shakeel Khan, and Sabeen Ghori.
Sofia Saeed Shah, Sikandar Khatoon, Kiran Masood, Farah Sohail, Bilqis Mukhtar, and Qaratul Ain are the MQM-P’s picks for the seats in the Sindh Assembly.
In the current National Assembly at least 10 political parties are out of the race for receiving the reserved seats.
These parties include the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), Markazi Muslim League (MML), PML-Q, PML-Zia, BNP-M, BNP-Awami, BAP, PkMAP, ANP and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI).
Previously, the PTI started negotiations with the JI to use its platform for bagging the reserved seats. However the talks, according to sources, broke down because the JI had already submitted its list of candidates for the reserved seats that could not be altered.
According to the sources, if the PTI used the JI platform, it would put 22 JI lawmakers in the NA, besides 30 in the Punjab Assembly and a large group in the K-P Assembly.
The PTI independent members were of the opinion that the move would directly benefit the JI.  Therefore, they refrained from forming an alliance with the party.
An ECP spokesperson drew attention of the politicians for the reserved seats to file the returns of their election expenses (Form C) by Wednesday (today).
The spokesperson added that if they did not file the returns, the notification of their success would not be issued.
