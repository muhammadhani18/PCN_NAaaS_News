0,Rupee falls to 3-week low against dollar,"RDA inflows fall to $142m in Jan 2024, compared to $160m in Dec 2023","In an unexpected move, the Pakistani currency plunged to a three-week low at Rs279.57 against the US dollar in the interbank market, ending nearly two weeks of stability. This sudden decline comes amidst a reduction in inflows of foreign currencies into the system.
The overvalued currency in the interbank market seemed to have taken cues from the declining open market rates, especially against the backdrop of political uncertainty and its potential impact on securing the next IMF loan programme, crucial for stabilising the local economy.
In a recent development, the inflows of foreign currency sent home by overseas Pakistanis through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) slowed down to $142 million in January 2024, compared to $160 million in the previous month of December 2023, according to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data.
The domestic currency dropped by 0.07% or Rs0.21, closing at a three-week low of Rs279.57 against the greenback, as per SBP data.

Previously, the currency had gained around 10% or Rs28 over the past five months, reaching a three-month high of slightly over Rs279/$ until last week in the interbank market, compared to the record low of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) matrix suggests that the currency was overvalued at previous week levels and required some depreciation to make imports more expensive and exports more competitive. The REER appreciated to 101.7 in January from 98.8 in December 2023.
In the open market, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, the currency extended losses by a further 0.05%, or Rs0.16, closing at Rs282.32/$, maintaining its downturn for the eighth consecutive working day in the smaller market. The disparity in the value of the rupee between the interbank and open markets widened to Rs2.75 (almost 1%).

1,FBR collection surges to Rs5.150 trillion,"Reports 30% growth amid strong taxation drive, anti-smuggling efforts","The Federal Board of Revenue has collected Rs5.150 trillion from July 2023 to mid-February 2024, compared to Rs3.973 trillion over the same period last fiscal year, reflecting a 30% growth. Tax refunds increased by over 28% during this period, as stated in a press release issued by the finance ministry on Tuesday.
Domestic tax growth has been approximately 40%, while import duty and related taxes grew by 16% from July 2023 to January 2024. The surge in revenues coincided with GDP revival and enhanced scrutiny of FBR collections. However, growth in import taxes decreased due to downward adjustments in import tariffs over the years and recent restrictions on import licenses imposed by the state bank.
Revenue collection from imports reflects improvements in import valuation, yielding Rs151 billion, along with a significant 69% growth in anti-smuggling efforts. 
Revenue mobilisation from domestic taxes now accounts for over 64% of total revenues collected, while the share from import taxes has declined to 36% from over 50% three years ago. This revenue growth was driven by various sources of taxation. Income tax collections surged by 40%, from Rs1.751 billion to Rs2.447 billion. Major contributors included banks, the petroleum and POL sector, the textile industry, the power sector and various service sectors.

2,Budget deficit increases to Rs8.54tr,Cuts external loan estimates by over $6 billion to $11.4 billion,"The interim government has made major revisions to this fiscal year’s budget, significantly increasing the federal budget deficit to a new record high of Rs8.54 trillion but cutting the external loans estimates by over $6 billion due to the non-materialisation of Eurobonds and foreign commercial loans.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Finance released its new Annual Borrowing Plan, detailing the revised estimates of Pakistan’s growing gross financing needs for bridging the budget deficit and debt repayments.
The new report reveals that, compared to the Rs7.5 trillion federal budget deficit target approved by the last National Assembly, the Ministry of Finance has projected a record Rs8.54 trillion deficit for fiscal year 2023-24. This revised estimate is Rs1.03 trillion or 14% higher than the budgeted target and is equal to 8% of the size of the economy—a level considered highly unsustainable and already burdened by debt.
The revision was necessitated solely due to earlier under-reporting of interest payments and unrealistic estimates of foreign debt-related inflows. The Express Tribune reported last September that the Ministry of Finance understated the interest cost by over Rs1 trillion and over-projected the disbursement of foreign loans by around $4.5 billion.
The report shows that, against the budget estimate of Rs7.3 trillion cost on account of interest payments, the revised allocation under this head is Rs8.33 trillion—a slippage of Rs1.03 trillion or 14%. The cost of domestic interest payments has increased from Rs6.4 trillion to Rs7.4 trillion. Similarly, the allocation for interest payments on external loans has also increased from Rs872 billion to Rs998 billion.
As a result of these revisions, if all other expenditures remain constant, the size of the federal budget has now jumped to a record Rs15.5 trillion compared to the Rs14.5 trillion outlay approved by the last National Assembly in June 2023.
Prepared by the Debt Management Office of the finance ministry, the new Annual Borrowing Plan lays down the borrowing strategy of the government to meet its gross financing needs (GFN). The report underlines that the government will continue to engage with domestic and international investors to improve coordination and information disclosure.
Had the government listened to the debt office in June last year, it would have avoided the latest revision on account of debt servicing costs.
The ministry further stated that interest expenses during the first half of this fiscal year amounted to Rs4.2 trillion, with 88% attributed to interest on domestic debt.
For the current fiscal year, Pakistan’s gross financing needs are estimated at a record Rs25.5 trillion or equal to 24% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), significantly higher than the sustainable financing level estimated at around 15% of GDP for a developing country like Pakistan.
Debt forecast
The Ministry of Finance has also revised its projections of borrowings from both domestic and external sources. The reliance on domestic sources has been increased substantially due to reluctance on the part of foreign lenders to provide new money due to poor credit ratings despite an International Monetary Fund umbrella.
The report shows that the government has cut its projections of gross foreign loans from Rs7.2 trillion to just Rs3.3 trillion—a reduction of 54% in rupee terms. There has been a corresponding increase in domestic loans—up from nearly Rs31 trillion to Rs34.2 trillion.
In dollar terms, the ministry has cut the foreign inflow projections from $17.7 billion to $11.4 billion—a downward adjustment of $6.3 billion, according to the new Annual Borrowing Plan. The revision has mainly been made on account of projections for Eurobonds and foreign commercial loans.

Read Budget deficit surges over 50%
The Ministry of Finance has dropped the plan to float $1.5 billion Eurobonds. It has also cut the estimates of receiving $4.5 billion foreign commercial loans to just around $2.5 billion. The report shows the projected inflows under the heads of both the commercial sources and “others” at $3.1 billion. This includes a $1 billion rollover of Chinese commercial loans maturing in June.
The finance ministry stated that external budgetary disbursements were recorded as $5.4 billion during the first half of this fiscal year. Compared to this, the external budgetary repayment during the first half of the fiscal year amounted to $3.3 billion, it added. In addition to this, China rolled over $1 billion in July last year and Saudi Arabia also extended $3 billion for one more year in December.
The Ministry of Finance stated that the government remained committed to completing actions associated with multilateral programme loans, which are in the pipeline and are projected to be disbursed during the second half of this fiscal year.
The government still hopes to receive $5.2 billion from multilateral creditors, which is largely in line with the original projections.
The ministry stated that Pakistan “stands committed to repay $1 billion Eurobond in April 2024”. It added that the issuance of new Eurobond-backed debt “will be considered once feasible”. It also expected bilateral deposits to be rolled over during the January-June period of this fiscal year.
A $2 billion Chinese debt is maturing on March 23rd and $2 billion in June (including $1 billion commercial).
The finance ministry stated that the government implemented a range of reform measures as part of the programme loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. These measures included the publication of the National Medium-Term Fiscal Framework and Goods and Services Tax harmonisation across federal and provincial jurisdictions.
It further stated that it also implemented the lenders’ conditions related to debt management, property valuation, and the energy sector, digitalisation of the payment system, improved tax administration, improved quality of public expenditures and cash management, the supply of credit for women, development of entrepreneurial capacity of women, and establishing strong institutional capacity for women in public and financial institutions.
The finance ministry stated that its borrowing operations remained smooth during the first half of this fiscal year. Due to expenditure rationalisation measures taken by the government, a federal primary surplus of Rs1.5 trillion was posted during the first half. However, the report showed that by the end of this fiscal year, this primary surplus would turn into a Rs202 billion primary deficit. It stated that in order to make debt management operations more competitive and improve transparency in borrowing operations as well as diversify the investors’ base, the government undertook amendments in the Treasury Bills Rules, 1998, and Ijara Sukuk Rules, 2008.
Pursuant to these amendments, the government carried out a maiden auction of one-year fixed-rate Ijara Sukuk at the stock market. It received healthy participation of Rs478 billion against a target of Rs30 billion.

3,Power Division claims circular debt frozen at Rs2.310tr,"Says efficiency measures, anti-theft drive resulted in meeting IMF target","The Power Division, on Tuesday, claimed that it had met the target of freezing circular debt at Rs2.310 trillion as of December 21, 2023, in its efforts to manage the power sector and address technical and commercial losses.
The Power Division secretary informed a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Power, chaired by Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, about this achievement.

The Secretary of the Power Division provided a detailed briefing on the status of circular debt, explaining that all circular debts had met their set target of Rs2.310 trillion as of December 21, 2023, including those successfully negotiated with the International Monetary Fund, ensuring consistency in 2024 as well.

The Power Division attributed the achievement of targets to efficiency in managing the power sector and addressing technical and commercial losses through tariff adjustments. Additionally, Rs85.7 billion has been recovered due to an anti-theft drive initiated in the second week of August 2023.

The ministry stated that addressing circular debt would lead to progress rather than regression. Despite objections from the Election Commission, the Secretary of the Power Division emphasised that restrictions on staff posting had been imposed to control electricity theft.

The session began with inquiries about the report regarding two matters: awarding of contracts to M/s Sinohydro Corporation for LoT-I, M/s Harbin Electric International for LoT-II, and consultant M/s GOPA Intec for the construction of a 765kV double circuit transmission line from Dasu Hydro Power Station to Islamabad I/C Grid Station and ADB project ACSR Bunting Conductor LoT-11 A, discussed and referred to the Power Division in the last meeting.

The managing director of NESPAK provided a detailed briefing on DTLP (Lot-I by M/s Sinohydro Corporation Limited), DTLP (Lot-II by M/s Harbin Electric International), DTLP (Consultant Hiring by M/s GOPA Intec), and ADB-4018-2022 (M/s Newage Cables Lahore). Additionally, he discussed the pre-qualification matter with Lot-I by M/s Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The minister for Energy (Power Division) added that the World Bank, being the donor agency, has the right to set the framework for changes, emphasising complete transparency and refuting malicious actions.

The committee members also discussed Public Petition No PP-5485 regarding the restoration of electricity in Mirani Dam Feeder Dasht, District Kech. The Power Division explained that the system had deteriorated due to floods and stressed the necessity of local support, as 80% of the inefficiency is attributed to a lack of financial resources and law enforcement support. The chairman committee assured the ministry of his support and recommended writing a letter to the provincial government of Balochistan to facilitate the supply of electricity in the area.

Furthermore, the committee members discussed the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce in its meeting held on September 12th and 13th, 2023, in Karachi. The secretary of the Power Division expressed that the commerce, power, finance, and petroleum divisions are collectively working to resolve the matter, especially concerning the substantial tariff involved.

The committee members also considered Public Petition No PP-5652 & 5653 against the management of K-Electric (KE) IBC for the illegal disconnection of PMT in Jahanabad near Gulshan-e-Maymar, Karachi. The KE official explained that after analysis, it was discovered that the fault was at the PMT end, and the issue had already been resolved.

4,Power generation drops 2.4% in Jan amid rising fuel costs,Cost of production surged by 23% due to increased reliance on expensive fuels,"Pakistan’s power generation dropped by 2.4% to 8,314 Gigawatt hours (GWh) in January 2024 due to low demand in the system during the winter month. However, the cost of the fuel component in the overall production surprisingly surged by 23% to Rs13.79 per unit due to increased reliance on expensive fuels like imported gas, furnace oil, and diesel.
According to data compiled by Arif Habib Limited, electricity generation decreased by 2.4% in the month under review compared to 8,515 GWh in January 2023.

Despite the low demand in the system, Pakistan increased generation from expensive fuel-run power plants after generation from comparatively low-cost powerhouses declined, including nuclear plants, local coal-fired plants, and local gas-run plants. Production from the cheapest hydropower plants increased on a year-on-year basis but remained relatively low in the month.

While speaking to The Express Tribune, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company’s Head of Research, Samiullah Tariq, stated that production from the cheapest hydropower plants increased by 15.5% to 924 GWh in January on a year-on-year basis.
Production from hydel plants, however, remains low usually in January when the flow of water decreases due to the maintenance of canals.

Production from the second-cheapest nuclear power plants reduced by around 8% to 1,728 GWh in January compared to the same month of the previous year, “apparently due to conjunction on transmission lines taking power from the south to the northern parts of the country,” Tariq said.

He maintained that while nuclear power plants are installed in Karachi (south), production from the plants is utilised primarily in the high-demand areas located in the north of the country.

Besides, production from other cheaper sources like solar and wind also remained low in January compared to the same month of the previous year due to seasonal constraints.

In this backdrop, and to keep the transmission lines working, the government had to increase production from expensive options like furnace oil and diesel.

Read Power generation hits 33-month low
Additionally, higher availability of imported (expensive) LNG in the month allowed the government to utilise the fuel for power generation, pushing the power tariff higher.

AHL stated in a brief comment that during January 2024, actual power generation was 4.7% lower than the reference generation. “This decline in generation is expected to result in higher capacity charges for the third quarter (Jan-Mar) FY23 QTA (quarterly tariff adjustment).”

Tariq explained that the lower production causes an increase in capacity payment, resulting in making power tariffs more expensive for end-consumers.

The research house’s work shows generation on diesel cost (only fuel component) at Rs45.61 per unit in January, while there was no diesel-based production in January 2023.
The fuel cost of furnace oil surged by 22.33% to Rs35.44 per unit in the month compared to Rs28.97 per unit in the corresponding month of the previous year.

The price of imported power surged by almost 28% to Rs32.80 per unit. The cost of production (fuel cost only) through imported gas-fired power plants rose by 11% to Rs24.30 per unit.

The cost of production on local gas shot up by 43.3% to Rs13.75 per unit after the government increased the fuel price for the first time in November 2023. The local gas was made further expensive for different users the second time in February 2024.

The cost of generation through local coal-fired plants surprisingly spiked by 72.3% to Rs11.92 per unit in January compared to Rs6.92 per unit in January 2023.

Nuclear power became costlier by almost 24% to Rs1.33 per unit compared to Rs1.07 per unit this time last year.

5,PSX slips despite strong opening,"KSE-100 index adds 4.50 points, settles at 60,464.24","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed some productivity on Tuesday, although it failed to build on Monday’s gains as investors continued grappling with uncertainty over the political scenario.
The trading session began positively, reaching an intraday high of 61,237.51 points before midday. However, the KSE-100 index couldn’t sustain this momentum as investors struggled with warnings from Fitch regarding potential upheavals on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and dismal data on the current account deficit, which stood at $269 million in January 2024. Consequently, the index slipped below the 61,000 mark and eventually touched an intraday low of 60,420.83 points in its final trading hours.
Despite this, Barclays remained optimistic, stating that Pakistan is unlikely to default on Eurobonds and praised the Sharif-led government for playing a less disruptive role. This aided the index to close on a positive note with some gains.
Notably, in the pharmaceutical sector, stocks surged following news of deregulation on non-essential medication prices. “Stocks closed flat as investors weigh Fitch warnings over upheavals on IMF programme on political uncertainty and dismal data on the current account deficit at $269 million in January 2024,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Barclays overweight on Pakistan unlikely to opt default on Eurobonds and asserts Sharif-led government less disruptive played catalyst role in positive close.”
At the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded gains of 4.50 points, or 0.01%, settling at 60,464.24.
Topline Securities noted in its report that the KSE-100 index opened positively, reaching an intraday high of 777.77 points. However, the index couldn’t sustain the positivity, closing at 60,464.24 (+4.50 points).
“The market sentiment soured amidst enduring political gridlock hampering the formation of the federal government and a dearth of favourable catalysts.”

“In the pharmaceutical domain, a surge ensued following news of the ministry’s green light for deregulating the prices of non-essential medications,” it said. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report that the inability to build on Monday’s gains saw the KSE-100 contained with HoD coming in at 61,237, well below 62,000 near term resistance.
“49 stocks rose and 42 fell with Hub Power Company (+1.99%), Systems Limited (+2.28%), and Pakistan State Oil (+3.65%) the biggest contributors to index gains while Oil and Gas Development Company (-2.18%), Pakistan Petroleum (-2.06%), and Mari Petroleum Company (-2.03%) the largest downside contributors,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the positive news flow on the political front regarding a resolution to form a government lifted the market. “Going forward, we recommend investors to avail any downside as an opportunity to buy in the banking and exploration and production (E&P) sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 364.4 million shares against Monday’s tally of 261.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs10.9 billion.
Shares of 349 companies were traded, with 174 stocks closing higher, 155 dropping, and 20 remaining unchanged. Bank of Punjab led in volume with trading in 117.02 million shares, gaining Rs0.25 to close at Rs6.27. It was followed by Pakistan International Airlines Corp with 19.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.04 to close at Rs11.10, and K-Electric with 19.2 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs4.26.
Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs127.9 million, according to NCPL.

6,Chinese water-saving facilities delivered,"Advanced equipment to be used on 2,000ha in smart farm project","The first batch of equipment for the ‘Million Acres of Green Pakistan Smart Farm Project’, involving Chinese water-saving industry leader Tianjin Dayu Irrigation Group, has been packed and delivered.
Intelligent water and fertiliser integrated irrigation equipment will be utilised on 2,000 hectares of farmland in Pakistan for crop planting and irrigation of wheat, cotton, tomatoes, corn, and other crops, supporting smart farm construction.
On July 7, 2023, the then-prime minister launched the LIMS (Land Information and Management System) initiative, which includes the ‘Million Acres of Green Pakistan Smart Farm Project’, aiming to enhance agricultural development, productivity, and meet growing population needs through advanced technology and modern irrigation systems.
“Agriculture is Pakistan’s pillar industry. The world’s most advanced technology will help us increase production. It can not only be for self-use, but will also be of great help to our food exports in the future. At the same time, Dayu Group has also made considerable achievements in flood prevention, disaster early warning, rural sewage treatment, and so on. We hope to cooperate closely with Dayu in multiple dimensions,” said Ghulam Qadir, Pakistan’s Commercial Counsellor in the Pakistan Embassy, Beijing.

7,Experts warn of impending food crisis,Highlight risks of climate change at Pak-Korea nutrition conference,"Food and agricultural experts have stressed that failing to take appropriate initiatives could severely impact the future generations of the country due to rising food shortages and malnutrition resulting from various factors. They highlighted that Pakistan is facing numerous challenges regarding food insecurity and malnutrition, which stem from issues such as poverty, limited access to clean water, inadequate infrastructure, and climate change-induced disasters like floods, torrential rains, and droughts. The experts suggested that the government should make comprehensive efforts to address these challenges by improving agricultural practices, investing in infrastructure, enhancing social safety nets, and promoting sustainable development initiatives.
These discussions took place during a two-day Pakistan-Korea Nutrition Centre (PKNC) conference on food nutrition and public health held at the main auditorium hall of Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) on Tuesday. The event was organised by SAU’s Institute of Food Sciences and Technology in collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency Pakistan and the University of Agriculture Faisalabad.
Experts underscored the need to control post-harvest losses by implementing various measures, including improving infrastructure for storage and transportation, promoting modern harvesting techniques, educating farmers on proper handling and storage practices, implementing effective pest control measures, encouraging the use of appropriate packaging materials, and investing in technology for monitoring and managing post-harvest processes. They also highlighted the importance of establishing cold chain facilities and promoting value addition through food processing to reduce losses and improve the efficiency of the agricultural supply chain.
Dr Kim Jae Han, Programme Manager of Pakistan-Korea Nutrition Centre, advocated for increased attention to agricultural production and rural health. He delivered a presentation on the significance of nutrition and health education programmes at universities.

Read Global collaboration for food security stressed
Sindh Agriculture Research Director General Noor Muhammad Baloch highlighted the need to reclaim 8 million hectares of uncultivated land for agriculture and to train rural women in kitchen gardening.
SAU VC Professor Dr Fateh Marri highlighted that 45% of children under five years of age in Pakistan are affected by food shortages, with over 32% being underweight for their age and 15% suffering from severe malnutrition. He stressed the need for collaboration among scientific institutions, experts, and stakeholders to ensure food security.
“Climate change has had negative effects on agricultural production and its quality, which also pose major risks to food security,” he added.
Sindh Food Authority Director General (DG) Agha Fakhar Hussain stressed the importance of addressing health hazards associated with harmful food and announced the expansion of the food business monitoring system. Moreover, initiatives such as chemical analysis and microbiology laboratories are in progress, along with training and internship programmes for university graduates to play a role in local communities.
SAU Institute of Food Sciences and Technology Director Professor Dr Aijaz Hussain Soomro said factors of climate change, including more rains, sudden floods, and water shortages, have been taking a heavy toll on food security in the country.
University of Agriculture Faisalabad Dean Dr Masood Sadiq Butt highlighted the benefits of food processing, value addition, food composition, maternal and child health, and education.

9,PM highlights rich natural resources,Says decision of US-based firm to invest $200m was vote of confidence in policies,"Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, on Tuesday, reassured the government’s all-out support to investors, underscoring that the effective utilisation of human as well as mineral resources would lead to a stable, prosperous, and rising Pakistan.
“Our human resource is more important than our mineral resource. The human resource, coupled with the mineral resource, will lead to a stable, prosperous, and rising Pakistan,” the prime minister said, addressing the signing ceremony of a joint venture agreement between Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC) and the US-based Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated for establishing a dedicated facility for crushing and packaging pink salt for export purposes.
Managing Director of the PMDC, Asad Ahmed, and President of Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated, Ahmed Nadeem Khan, signed the agreement, witnessed by Prime Minister Kakar, Energy Minister Muhammad Ali, and relevant senior authorities.
The prime minister said the practice of exporting raw materials should come to an end as the export of products after value addition was direly needed.
“This is the path for Pakistan. This is the right step. We will be exporting quality product in the coming days. Pakistan will get rightful branding for its product. This will pave the way for further opportunities,” the prime minister remarked, who also distributed awards among individuals who played a key role in the joint venture agreement.
Calling the US a “most valued” trading partner of Pakistan, he said the agreement symbolised the investment climate in the country that would further strengthen the friendship between the two countries and their people.
He said the decision of the US-based firm to invest $200 million in Pakistan was a resounding vote of confidence in the government’s economic policies. Prime Minister Kakar said the investment was not just about pink salt but about trust, partnership, and shared prosperity.
He told the gathering that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was playing an important role in creating an enabling environment for foreign direct investment. It serves as a one-window facility for investors besides streamlining processes and removing bureaucratic hurdles to attract investment in the fields of mining, energy, IT, agriculture, livestock, industry, and tourism, he added.
The prime minister lauded the friendship of the American people, calling them the “most warm and generous” people on earth with openness and liberal values which was a role model for a thriving economy.

He said Pakistan was not rich for its geostrategic location rather it was a geo-economic offer as the country sat on the Tethyan Belt of 2800sq km filled with immense mineral resources.
Earlier, Energy Minister Muhammad Ali said the agreement was the beginning of a long journey that would boost investors’ confidence. He said Pakistan had tremendous potential in the mineral sector, and the government was committed, focused, and has prioritised the sector to exploit the potential through more investment in the pink salt sector.
PMDC Chairman Shamsuddin lauded the SIFC’s role which led to a surge in PMDC’s profit by three to four times compared to last year. He said the PMDC’s geologists were actively moving around for exploration purposes and hoped that the number of mining leases would continue to grow.
Shamsuddin called for further empowerment of the SIFC, strengthening of the Geological Survey of Pakistan besides providing security to miners, and amending the rules to streamline processes.
Managing Director of PMDC Engineer Asad Ahmed said the agreement represented the culmination of excessive collaboration between the partners and thanked the petroleum ministry and SIFC for effective coordination.
Chief Communications Officer of the Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated Mubarak Khan called the agreement the beginning of a great journey and a great opportunity for Pakistan as the pink salt would act as an ambassador in millions of homes internationally.
Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated said the project would lead to the global monetisation of Pakistan’s mineral resources, which was one of the richest countries with huge mineral resources.
