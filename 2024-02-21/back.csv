0,"PML-N’s ‘last stint’ in power, predicts Vawda","Ex-minister claims N-League, PPP, PTI in phases of fizzling out","Former federal minister Faisal Vawda on Tuesday predicted that the next federal government would be the “last one” of the PML-N and after that it would be “limited to Punjab” – just like the MQM-P was “restricted” to the urban areas of Sindh.
“It [PML-N] would work with every part [of the machine]. It will work for a while and then break down. This is the future of the PML-N,” Vawda told a private TV news channel.

Vawda made similar predictions about his former party PTI and PPP as well.

“These are three parties are in their phases of fizzling out,” he added.

He forecasted that after the PPP fizzled out, the PTI would be the next to go.

“The PTI is forming governments on chances.”

He elaborated that the PTI was claiming that it would form its government here and there despite lacking the numerical strength to do so.

“It [PTI] is not within a democratic system. The politics of ‘Maula Jutt’ will not work.”

He advised his former party to become part of the system if it wanted to serve the country and then address its problems.
The former federal minister believed that that a coalition government would be formed within six or eight days.

“Politically and democratically they [the PML-N and PPP] are dead. There are also locked because of the circumstances and events. They will form the government and enjoy the power,” he added.

Apparently addressing the ‘powerful circles’, he said they had “enjoyed” the “expired” leaders, adding that the nation had told them where “they” stood, referring to the recent general elections.

Vawda further claimed that an official would step down from a “high post” to take over as the Senate chairman and remain neutral.

2,SC rebukes police for warrantless entry,Says privacy of home is inviolable under Article 14(1) of the Constitution,"The Supreme Court has rebuked the Islamabad Police for entering the house of a suspect without an arrest warrant, emphasizing that the privacy of the home is inviolable under Article 14(1) of the Constitution.

""Without obtaining a search warrant, the privacy of the petitioner’s home was violated. Article 8 of the Constitution gives paramountcy to the Fundamental Rights (including Article 14).

""[This] cannot be abridged, and if any law is made in contravention thereof, it states that it shall to such extent be void,"" said an 8-page written order authored by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa.

Justice Isa was leading a three-member bench that heard the bail application of a Pir, who was booked under Section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), 1860 — blasphemy law — for allegedly displaying a poster at his residence showing pictures of sacred personalities.

The complainant, who had gone to the Pir’s residence for a ""dum,"" had reported to the police, which had raided the Pir’s house and taken the alleged poster into their possession.

The verdict noted that when the court inquired from police officials whether they obtained a search warrant before entering the petitioner’s house, they replied in the negative.

""Since Section 295-C of the PPC was mentioned as the only offence in the FIR, we inquired whether the matter had been investigated by an officer of the rank of SP [superintendent police], as required by Section 156-A of the Code, and were told that this too was not done.""

The court noted that an offence under Section 295-C of the PPC must be investigated by an officer not below the rank of a superintendent police (SP), as stipulated by Section 156A of the code.

It stated that Verse 27, Chapter 24 (An-Nur) of the Holy Qur’an states that believers do not enter houses other than their own until they have asked permission.

""When the police themselves do not abide by the law, it is a matter of grave concern. And all the more so when a citizen’s liberty is involved. It is noted that in such cases the complainant, rather than the police, takes the lead, and also effectively takes over the investigation.

""This is done in complete derogation of the law and the Constitution. The SSP stated that he will ensure that in the future, the law is strictly followed. He further states that he will be examining whether disciplinary action is required to be initiated against the delinquent policemen,"" it said.

6,ROs give testimonies before ECP panel,"Reject claims of former commissioner that elections in Rawalpindi were massively rigged, sources say"," 
A high level committee formed to investigate the explosive allegations of Rawalpindi division’s former commissioner Liauat Ali Chatha has recorded testimonies of all the returning officers (ROs) for the 13 National Assembly and 26 Punjab Assembly constituencies in the division.
The ROs on Tuesday also submitted their written statements.
According to sources in the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the ROs have rejected Chatha’s claims that elections in Rawalpindi were massively rigged.
The officials have stated that they did not face any pressure to change election results and that elections on February 8 took place in a transparent and peaceful manner.
The sources told The Express Tribune that the committee has now started compiling its report which it will soon submit to the ECP. On Tuesday, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) also submitted a transcript of Chatha's press conference to the probe panel.
Chatha sent shockwaves through the country on Saturday by claiming that massive rigging took place in all constituencies of Rawalpindi under his watch in the February 8 elections.
Taking responsibility for what he termed a “heinous crime”, Chatha accused the chief election commissioner and the chief justice of Pakistan of complicity.
In a stunning admission, Chatha also announced his intention to surrender to the authorities, acknowledging his role in tampering with the electoral outcome by flipping losers into winners.
A day after the incident, the ECP announced the formation of the high-level committee to probe the allegations. On Monday, the six district returning officers (DROs) of Rawalpindi division had submitted their written statements to the committee.

7,JCP to pick next LHC CJ on 23rd,Incumbent chief justice of provincial high court set to retire on March 7,"The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is scheduled to meet on Friday, February 23, to discuss the elevation of Lahore High Court (LHC) senior judge Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan to the position of the provincial high court’s chief justice.

The LHC’s incumbent chief justice, Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, is set to retire next month, on March 7. Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa, who is also the JCP chairman, will chair the upcoming meeting of the commission.
On December 4, the CJ formed a committee to review the JCP Rules 2010 and define the protocols for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.

The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) has persistently advocated for alterations in the JCP rules, proposing that the sole authority to select judges should not rest with the chief justice of Pakistan.

However, at the December 4 meeting, two JCP members, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, had expressed objections to the committee's formation at this juncture, especially in the absence of an elected government.

PBC member Advocate Akhtar Hussain had highlighted that judge appointments, being a policy matter, have nevertheless been executed. Stressing the urgency of filling vacant positions in high courts, Hussain had urged the expeditious framing of judge nomination regulations.

On December 17, The Express Tribune had reported that the committee, formed by CJ Isa, is contemplating the establishment of a committee to nominate candidates for appointment as judges in the superior courts.

Sources had suggested that the committee aimed to regulate the discretionary powers of chief justices concerning the appointment of judges to the superior judiciary.

A member of the rules committee informed The Express Tribune that there was also a proposal for a medical board to assess the health and mental condition of judge nominees.

To ensure timely appointments to vacant positions in high courts and the apex court, deadlines will be specified in the JCP rules.

Candidates will engage in informal interactions with JCP members. Several proposals are under consideration to enhance the criteria for judges' appointments, he had said.

8,PTI gears up for fresh intra-party polls,"After previous setbacks, PTI to hold anouther round of internal polls in 15 days","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is gearing up for another round of intra-party elections, scheduled to take place within the next 15 days, according to party sources.

The party has already set the wheels in motion for the crucial electoral process.

Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has been designated as the chairman, while Raoof Hassan will assume the role of Chief Election Commissioner for PTI's intra-party polls.

The elections are slated to be conducted simultaneously across the country.

The development follows the recent setback experienced by PTI in the inter-party polls. The last round of such polls faced rejection by the apex court.

Previously, on February 2, a day after PTI announced the schedule for fresh inter-party polls, the party opted to postpone them until after February 8.

The decision was attributed to the commitments of members in their respective constituencies and alleged ""unlawful blocking of PTI venues by the administration.""

Ahead of the polls, the Supreme Court had stripped the party of its symbol, upholding the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) decision to declare PTI's internal polls as ""unconstitutional.""

Consequently, the party lost its iconic 'bat' electoral symbol, compelling its members to contest elections as independent candidates under different symbols. Furthermore, PTI forfeited the right to reserved seats for women and minorities.

In the aftermath of the general elections on February 8, a significant number of PTI-backed independent candidates emerged victorious. However, due to the altered political landscape, the party had to forge an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to secure reserved seats.
