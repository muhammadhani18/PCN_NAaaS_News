0,‘Cultural diversity without mother tongues can’t sustain’,Dr Wassan said that the 'Mother Tongue Day' serves as a reminder of the imperative to preserve linguistic diversity,"To uphold folk wisdom, heritage, and culture, anthropologists and linguists emphasise the importance of fostering all local languages, advocating that primary-level education should be delivered in the mother tongue. 
Today, Pakistan, alongside the rest of the world, commemorates 'Mother Tongue Day' under the theme of 'Multilingual Education: A Pillar of Intergenerational Learning'.
""Language is a fundamental element of knowledge, through which it is transformed,"" remarked anthropologist Dr. Rafique Wassan. ""Moreover, language serves to protect and preserve culture,"" he added.
UNESCO highlights the role of multilingual and multicultural societies, emphasising that languages serve as conduits for transmitting and sustaining traditional knowledge and cultural heritage sustainably. Alarmingly, UNESCO reports that globally, 40 percent of the population lacks access to education in a language they speak or understand.
Ramzan Baloch, a writer, raises concerns about languages unsupported by the state, such as Balochi, lamenting its lack of encouragement in school curriculums.

""If we aspire to cultivate a diverse society, we must actively promote all languages spoken within the country,"" Dr. Wassan urged, citing the threat of language imperialism that jeopardizes hundreds of languages. ""There is a complete dominancy of English language across the world. Everyone wants to learn it. It seems the only way of survival for many,"" he added.
Dr. Wassan, speaking from his anthropological perspective, advocates for the conservation of all languages, underscoring their role in facilitating understanding across different cultures and preserving heritage. ""We have to respect all languages. All languages,"" he urged.
""The essence of folk wisdom lies in language. The organic solution to any issue lies in the mother tongue, and we should respect each other's languages,"" asserted Amar Fayaz, the linguist. 
Fayaz emphasises the pivotal role of language in transmitting knowledge from one individual to another, asserting that no single language can single-handedly preserve humanity, rather, it is the collective interconnectedness of languages that achieves this.
Highlighting the politicization of languages in Pakistan, Fayaz urges for a shift towards fostering love and empathy through our languages, emphasizing their inherent interconnectedness.
In cities like Karachi, many parents express apprehension as their children do not learn their mother tongues in schools. ""The education system aims to teach children a particular language, primarily English, creating a significant detachment from our own culture,"" lamented Mustafa Aziz, a resident of Mehmoodabad. 
Aziz's concerns echo those of Baloch, who criticizes the intellectual class for neglecting their own languages.
Referring to the United Nations' endorsement of linguistic rights, Baloch advocates for primary education to be delivered in the mother tongue. 
Dr Wassan said that the 'Mother Tongue Day' serves as a reminder of the imperative to preserve linguistic diversity, ensuring the safeguarding of our collective cultural heritage for generations to come.

1,Sindh allows Centre to use PSM land for EPZ,Provincial cabinet also approves increase in Abiyana rates,"The caretaker Sindh cabinet has agreed to allow the federal government to use the land of Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) for the establishment of an Export Processing Zone (EPZ) on the condition that the land should be utilised exclusively for industrial purposes. The PSM land ownership right has been a bone of contention between the federal and provincial governments.
The cabinet, which convened with caretaker chief minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar in the chair, also made several other decisions which included the approval of an increase in the rates of Abiyana (water charges), conducting surveys of unsurveyed land, and rewriting the record of rights.
Minister of Irrigation Ishwar Lal informed the cabinet that gradual increases in Abiyana rates and water supply charges are necessary to meet the maintenance & repair (M&R) requirements of irrigation infrastructure. The current Abiyana collection is significantly lower than the M&R expenditure.

The cabinet approved a 100% increase in Abiyana rates for crops and water charges for municipal/domestic, industrial, and commercial uses.
The cabinet was informed that survey of the unsurveyed land would commence in each district, with 32 survey teams being constituted for the purpose. The teams, equipped with DGPS and other accessories, will send their findings to a designated lab for processing and preparation of land records.
Minister of Revenue Younus Dhaga presented plans for the re-writing and special revision of old land records. The cabinet approved a budget of Rs2,922.19 million for this purpose, with 10% to be released in the current financial year and the remainder in the next fiscal year.

2,‘Govt formed with ‘stolen mandate’ will not last long’,"PPP, PML-N and MQM will soon meet their political death, says Haleem","Haleem Adil Sheikh, President of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Sindh, has asserted that the government formed with what he claims to be a ""stolen mandate"" will lead to the political demise of the PPP, PML-N, and MQM. Haleem stated that this time, these opposition parties would be buried forever, and the PTI, led by Kaptaan, will emerge victorious.
While speaking to the media after appearing in an anti-terrorism court, Haleem expressed gratitude to the people of Pakistan, especially those in Karachi and Hyderabad, who despite facing challenges, supported the PTI during the chairman's imprisonment. 
He acknowledged the voters' determination in choosing the PTI, even when the party did not have its iconic 'bat' symbol, and its candidates were assigned unconventional and funny symbols like ""kaddu, tenda, baigan, and joota."" Haleem highlighted the resilience of PTI supporters who located PTI candidates and voted for them.

Reflecting on the recent political events, Sheikh stressed that the people gave PTI a mandate on February 8, but on February 9, a different selection occurred. He criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), saying that it got itself stuck in a quagmire - the more it pushes, the deeper it sinks.
Haleem claimed that the prime minister slot has become a ""hot seat,"" suggesting that whoever occupies it will face challenges. 
He insisted that the 180 seats robbed from the PTI will be reclaimed, and the government will be formed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and at the Centre. He warned that if the opposition forms a government with a ""fake and robbed mandate,"" it will lead to a collective political grave for PPP, PML-N, and MQM.

Protest

7,Three names short-listed for FUU VC,Sindh left out of the race in short-listing done through voting,"The Senate of the Federal Urdu University (FUU) has short-listed three names for the slot of vice chancellor of the varsity through a voting mechanism.
The three names, forwarded to President Dr Arif Alvi, who is also the chancellor of the university, are: Dr Bakht Jahan, Dr Muhammad Ali Shah, and Dr Zaabta Khan Shinwari, respectively the first, second, and third choices. Sindh is left out of the race in short listing done through voting.
The names were short-listed during a meeting of university senate chaired by Chancellor Alvi at the Presidency in Islamabad. All members of the senate reached a consensus on the first two names, Dr Bakht Jahan and Dr Muhammad Ali Shah. 
However, opinions were divided on the third candidate. Some members proposed Dr Athar Mehboob, but after extensive discussion and a voting process, Dr Zaabta Khan's name was included as the third candidate. The president did not participate in the voting process.
A senate member who attended the meeting informed The Express Tribune that during deliberations on the selection board for lecturers and assistant professors, some senators expressed concerns about the lack of sharing the inquiry report on which the board's formation was based.

Chancellor Alvi expressed his displeasure in response. Subsequently, a decision was made to maintain the current selection board. The new VC will have the authority to decide within six months of appointment whether to retain or dissolve the board and form a new one.
The Senate meeting did not address the university's financial crisis, leaving the resolution of this issue to the incoming VC. The Express Tribune reached out to VC candidate Dr Bakht Jahan for his plans to address the financial crisis. 
He said that he intended to collaborate with stakeholders and make decisions in consultation with them. He emphasised the importance of stakeholders owning the rule of law and the university. When asked about his approach, he said, ""I will adhere to the law, and I need to familiarise myself with its contents.""
Dr Muhammad Ali Shah, another candidate for the VC position, commented on strategies to resolve the financial crisis. He acknowledged that financial challenges are not unique and outlined a plan to increase resources, control expenses, and seek support from the public and private sectors. 
Regarding the transfer of the principal seat, he said that, if appointed, he would continue to travel between Karachi and Islamabad as the university has campuses in both cities, making it impractical to stay in one location.
