0,Rawalpindi tackles flooding risks,Allocates Rs48m for feasibility study to reroute sewage from Nullah Leh to Soan River,"The Planning and Development Department (P&DD) Punjab has approved funds worth Rs48 million to hire consultancy services for the feasibility study of shifting sewage from the City and Cantt areas of Rawalpindi to the Soan River through a large trunk sewerage system. The objective is to resolve the long-standing problem of Nullah Leh in three phases.
The trunk sewerage system will be built on both sides of the Nullah Lei in the first phase, the canal will be paved from the middle to accommodate the rainwater in the second phase, while roads will be constructed on both sides of Nullah Leh in the third phase.
The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has been appointed as the executing agency to hire the services of a consultant for a comprehensive feasibility study to construct a large sewage trunk on both sides of Nullah Leh. The cost of the project has been approved under Project Concept-2 (PC-2) and it will be included in the future annual development program (ADP).

The consultant will be assigned to prepare Project Concept -1 (PC-1) so that under the second phase, the middle part of the drain can be paved and the clean rainwater be passed from there and thrown into Swan River.
Under the first phase, trunk sewerage will be constructed on both sides of Nullah Lei along the 16km long route from New Katarian Bridge to Swan River, for which funds will be released after the feasibility study is completed.
According to the RDA sources, Nullah Lei will be covered with sewer trunks construction in the first phase, the middle part of Nullah Lei will be paved and rainwater will flow from there in the second phase and the third phase, roads will be constructed on both sides of Nullah Leh. The project will ease the woes of Rawalpindi city and Cantt motorists through an alternative route of traffic to Islamabad.
The Nullah Leh’s open sewage has been the cause of heavy losses of life and property during floods in monsoon. The need to solve the long-standing problem was strongly felt in 2006-7 when 80 human lives were lost and financial losses of billions of rupees during a historic flood in 2001-2.
The project to construct the Expressway with a secure sewerage system began in 2006-7, however, the 2008 governments in the federal and Punjab terminated the project.
Despite all efforts and announcements, the work on the Nullah Lei project could not be started due to its high cost, but now the caretaker Punjab government decided to start the Nullah Lei project in three phases.

5,"Fireworks, aerial firing banned in Pindi",Authorities aim to curb dangerous practices during Shab-e-Barat,"Amid the illegal sale of fireworks material, the Rawalpindi district administration has imposed an immediate ban on fireworks, firecrackers, and aerial firing under Section 144 on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat, which is expected to be observed on February 25.
The Station House Officers (SHOs) at all police stations across the district have been ordered to crack down on the sellers of fireworks and crackers forthwith.
The ban on the use of firecrackers hasn’t deterred the surge in sales of firecrackers, locally manufactured firecrackers, and Chinese matchstick firecrackers in the markets. 
Children are seen popping Chinese match crackers all day long in the city's streets and neighborhoods, resulting in small altercations among people.
Despite efforts, the police seem powerless to prohibit the selling of firecrackers. Some people have bought a lot of Chinese match crackers to bother the citizens on Shab-e-Barat, which is on upcoming Sunday, February 25.

Chinese match crackers are sold in a Rs30 worth box, which contains 20 to 25 small match crackers. Many students and children are busy purchasing these crackers with their own pocket money, even if their parents are stopping them.
Despite the ban, vendors continue to sell crackers and phuljari (sparklers) in the street markets throughout the city. Fireworks are being sold secretly and only to customers of acquaintance.
Nirankari Bazaar, situated between the City and Ganj Mandi police stations, is the wholesale hub for Chinese match firecrackers and indigenous firecrackers. Using referrals and connections, the shopkeepers of neighbouring tehsils of Murree, Kotli Sattian, Kahuta, Gujar Khan, and Taxila are even purchasing fireworks from Nirankari Bazaar. Local shopkeepers are no exception.
There are reports that a good quantity of fireworks have been stored in nearby warehouses by the wholesalers, who will supply these goods to shops secretly.
Youngsters have also reportedly purchased a large quantity of bullets and arranged weapons for intense aerial firing on Shab-e-Barat.
