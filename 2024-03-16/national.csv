0,Big industries’ output edges down,"High policy rate, increasing business cost hit manufacturing sector hard","The production of goods by Pakistan’s big industries slowed down during the first seven months of the current fiscal year and their growth fell 0.52% year-on-year as the manufacturing sector took a hit from the record high interest rate and the increasing cost of doing business.
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Friday that the growth in output of large-scale manufacturing (LSM) industries decreased less than 1% during July-January period of financial year 2023-24.
Big industrial units are suffering from restrictions on imports, the highest-ever interest rate of 22% and a constant increase in utility prices.
PBS released the manufacturing output figures three days before a scheduled meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The central bank will on Monday decide the policy rate for the next one and a half month amid hopes that the rate reduction cycle will begin soon as it stayed at the highest level for a longer period.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said this week that due to a substantial slowdown in inflation, the interest rate may start coming down from the current fiscal year.
The MPC’s decision will be guided by the outcome of the ongoing talks between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of the last loan tranche of $1.1 billion. In inaugural sessions, IMF Mission Chief Nathan Porter termed inflation still high.
The LSM trend indicates that this year Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth may remain around 2%. The government has targeted economic growth of 3.5% for the year.
During the first quarter (Jul-Sept) of the current fiscal year, the economy grew by 2.1% on the back of expansion of the agriculture sector. The National Accounts Committee will approve second quarter’s GDP growth figure by the end of March.
Caretaker finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar said last month that economic growth may increase by 3% during the second quarter, thanks to a healthy growth in the agriculture sector.
PBS reported that LSM output increased by 1.8% during January over the same month a year ago. In December, the growth rate was 3.4%, which has now slowed down further. On a month-on-month basis, the output growth was flat.
Since large industries contribute heavily to revenue collection and job creation, any change in their growth levels impacts the government and business sentiment across the board.
LSM contributes nearly one-tenth to the total national output, however, a constant decline in its share and growth may cause a lot of problems for the government, which is already struggling to create new job opportunities for the bulging workforce.
Main contributors to the overall negative growth of 0.52% include tobacco, textile, paper and board, iron and steel products, fabricated metal, computer, electronics and optical products, automobiles, electrical equipment, non-metallic minerals and transport equipment.
The performance of the auto industry remains subdued due to massive increases in input prices and the tightening auto financing. Car production decreased by 48% and sales dropped by nearly 49%. Trucks and buses’ production fell by 58% and their sales dipped nearly half.
During the seven-month period from July to January FY24, 12 out of 22 industries recorded a positive growth. These included food, beverages, clothing, leather products, coke and petroleum products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, rubber products, wood products, furniture, machinery and equipment, and footballs.
Pakistan’s unemployment rate remains high and a constant sluggish growth in the industrial sector is reducing employment opportunities.
Age and gender-wise unemployment analysis demonstrates that the youth between 15 and 24 years has the highest unemployment rate of 11.1%, followed by the age group of 25-34 years having a 7.3% unemployment ratio.
Unemployment among graduates is as high as 23.5%. The high unemployment among the educated youth also points to the irrelevance of general education to market needs. Moreover, there is a lack of entrepreneurial culture and necessary support.
Public spending on education and health stands around 2% of GDP compared to the average of 3.3% in other South Asian countries.
High percentages of out-of-school children have led to low education levels and low skilled labour, which mostly finds employment in the informal sector.
Pakistan’s technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programmes face multiple challenges related to access, coverage, governance and quality. Resultantly, there is a mismatch between the market demand and supply of skilled manpower, particularly for the international market.

1,Pakistan partners with Gates’ Foundation to overhaul FBR,Karandaaz Pakistan to use funds to hire firm to assess best way to digitalise tax system,"Pakistan entered into an agreement on Friday to utilise the resources of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to improve the poor efficiency of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), aimed at enhancing an extremely narrow tax base and low collection.
A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed by representatives of the FBR and Karandaaz Pakistan – an entity sponsored by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The CEO of Karandaaz Pakistan, Waqasul Hasan, also met with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb before the signing of the agreement. Aurangzeb has vowed to completely digitise FBR, aimed at ending corruption and leakages.
By using financial resources from the Gates’ foundation, Karandaaz Pakistan will hire a consulting firm to assess the business needs, existing IT infrastructure, systems, business processes, all existing available information, and assessment reports to establish the context and scope of work for digitalising the tax system of Pakistan.
On the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Karandaaz Pakistan was engaged to revolutionise the obsolete tax system. The decision to involve Karandaaz Pakistan underscores that the World Bank’s $400 million Pakistan Raises Revenue and the Asian Development Bank’s $300 million Domestic Resource Mobilisation programmes have failed to yield the desired results.
Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio hovers around 9%, while less than 3.4 million people are active taxpayers – two numbers that speak volumes about the inefficiency of the FBR and the failed donors-driven past attempts to restructure the tax machinery.

According to the MoU, the FBR will provide any existing assessment reports and studies, tax reforms agenda, vision, guidance, data, support, and relevant decision-making to Karandaaz to help the entity provide technical assistance. However, the FBR will not provide the personal details of the citizens.
The FBR will also provide all such data that help demonstrate the impact of the technical assistance and can be useful for the purposes of improving performance quality for stakeholders.
The agreement has been signed for a period of two years and can be further extended.
Karandaaz Pakistan will hire a consulting firm that has a proven track record of developing comprehensive digital strategies and implementation programmes for large public sector organisations, comparable to a tax regulatory authority in particular.
The consulting firm will also have proven expertise in business process assessment, improvement, and reengineering, including experience in data management, structuring, analytics, and governance.
The consulting firm will prepare a digital and IT transformation strategy and develop an implementation programme. It will also be required to mobilise the implementation of the devised programme to support procurement of the new IT systems, costing of the systems, and advisory for identifying the most suitable vendors.
The consulting firm will also design the change management strategy related to the digitalisation initiatives.
Karandaaz, on the advice of and in consultation with the Gates’ Foundation, will engage with FBR for the provision of financial and technical assistance, support, provision of works, and services that may be required by FBR for digitalising the tax system.
A Donors Coordination Committee will be established to share information and resources that could be leveraged to achieve the desired outcomes without duplication of effort and consumption of resources.

2,Weekly inflation hits 9-week high,High demand for food items in Ramazan fuels increase in prices,"Pakistan’s inflation reading hit a nine-week high at 1.36% in the week ended March 14, 2024 as energy and food prices rose significantly at the outset of Ramazan, squeezing the purchasing power of ordinary consumers.
According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics’ (PBS) data, the weekly inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI), maintained its uptrend for the fourth consecutive week.
It surged 32.89% in the week ended March 14 as compared to the same week of last year.
The increase in the SPI reading was led primarily by the price of tomato, which surged 21.96% to Rs166.58 per kg in the week under review compared to Rs136.59 per kg in the previous week. The second major boost to inflation came from bananas, which became costlier by 21.76% to Rs187.22 per dozen as opposed to Rs153.76 per dozen in the prior week.
Egg prices shot up by 7.15% to Rs277.11 per dozen compared to Rs258.63 per dozen a week earlier. Onion got costlier by 5.57% to Rs251.58 per kg from Rs238.30 per kg. The price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) went up by 4.45% to Rs295.35 per kg compared to Rs282.78 per kg in the past week.Prices of other goods rose up to 4% which included garlic, mutton, beef, chicken, georgette, shirting and long cloth, according to the PBS.
During the week under review, out of the 51 items covered by the SPI basket, prices of 18 (35.29%) items increased, 10 (19.61%) items decreased and 23 (45.10%) items remained unchanged.
Optimus Capital Management, in a short commentary, said the surge in weekly inflation by 1.36% was fueled mainly by electricity charges (which contributed 0.54 percentage point), tomatoes, bananas and onion, which cumulatively contributed 0.56 percentage point.
Meanwhile, the government temporarily suspended exports of onion and banana during Ramazan, until April 15, to stabilise prices in local markets. 
A leading exporter said the price of onion, used in almost all dishes, would gradually come down over the next few days as exporters were still purchasing the vegetable. He, however, said bananas were exported in very little quantities and the ban on their export would make no difference in its prices in local markets. The hike in the fruit’s price was largely associated with the production shortfall compared to its demand in the country.
The benchmark monthly inflation reading, measured by the Consumer Price Index, is likely to slow down to 20-21% in March due to a high base effect.

3,Stocks lose ground in range-bound trading,"KSE-100 index slips 247.80 points, settles at 64,816.47","Pakistan’s stock market on Friday fell nearly 250 points in range-bound trading as investors resorted to profit-taking over economic concerns and uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
At the commencement of trading, the KSE-100 index spiked and soon hit its intra-day high at 65,353.66 points. However, it could not maintain the momentum and took a dive in the very first hour when investors booked profits in stocks standing at high valuations.
The index fluctuated widely throughout the day with many ups and downs, touching its intra-day low at 64,759.60 towards the close of trading.
The major focus of the day was the ongoing review talks with the IMF and the announcement of monetary policy early next week. Many analysts expect the central bank to maintain the status quo, though others hoped for a rate cut to prop up economic activities.
“Profit-taking was witnessed at the PSX amid pressure on overbought stocks owing to investor concerns about economic uncertainty,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
“External financing challenges, uncertainty about the outcome of Pakistan-IMF review talks and expectations of status quo in the monetary policy announcement on March 18 amid 32.89% year-on-year surge in SPI inflation played the role of catalysts in bearish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 247.80 points, or 0.38%, and settled at 64,816.47.
Topline Securities, in its report, said that a range-bound session was observed as the index traded between its intra-day high of 289 points and intra-day low of -248 points. It closed at 64,816, down by 0.38%.
“This volatility in the market can be attributed to news that an IMF team has expressed displeasure over the Ministry of Finance’s remarks that it has met all structural benchmarks before the completion of the review by the fund staff and monetary policy on Monday,” it said. As a result, “investors preferred to remain on the sidelines.”
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented that the KSE-100 fell 1.5% week-on-week “with supply keeping the index suppressed below 66k”.
The current draw on liquidity remained at the all-time high of 67k with weekly support at 63k, it said.
“Friday saw selling pressure shave 0.6% off the index during the day with only 30 stocks rising and 63 falling.”
Meezan Bank (+1.25%), Lucky Cement (+1.31%) and NBP (+3.69%) were the biggest contributors to the index’s gains while OGDC (-2.45%), Hubco (-0.86%) and PPL (-1.19%) were the biggest drags, AHL added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 259.4 million shares against Thursday’s tally of 315.2 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs10.1 billion.
Shares of 322 companies were traded. Of these, 113 stocks closed higher, 192 dropped and 17 remained unchanged.
Hascol Petroleum was the volume leader with trading in 56.96 million shares, gaining Rs0.18 to close at Rs8.56. It was followed by Cnergyico PK with 19.6 million shares, losing Rs0.15 to close at Rs4.94 and WorldCall Telecom with 16.5 million shares, losing Rs0.01 to close at Rs1.34. Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs81.4 million, according to the NCCPL.

4,DGTO revokes solar association licence,"Accuses association of committing irregularities, violation of rules","The director general of trade organisations (DGTO), which works under the Ministry of Commerce, has revoked the licence of Pakistan Solar Association (PSA), allegedly because of its involvement in irregularities and gross violation of rules.
In an order, the DGTO barred key PSA members from taking membership of any other trade organisation as well as imposed a fine.
Officials working in the solar industry welcomed the DGTO’s decision, saying the PSA had “hijacked the entire industry”.
According to the DGTO, the current executive committee of the PSA has been found complicit and well aware of the illegal management of the affairs at the association by the “fake and bogus” secretary general.
The executive committee deliberately kept the information concealed from the regulator of trade organisations. “Therefore, it has been found in violation of the law.”
“Hence, the membership of all the executive committee members of PSA is hereby cancelled, exercising the powers conferred under Rule 11(3) of the ToRs (Terms of Reference), 2013,” the regulator said, adding that they were barred from taking membership of any trade organisation for a period of five years.
The DGTO also withdrew the conditional renewal of the licence of the association by the then regulator as the PSA failed to meet renewal conditions within the stipulated time period despite multiple reminders.

“By virtue of the withdrawal of the licence renewal, the PSA stands expired with immediate effect,” read the order.
It cancelled the membership of human resources committee members. They were also barred from membership of any trade organisation for a period of five years for appointing the secretary general against the laid-down procedure in the ToRs, 2013.
“Recommendation is hereby made to the federal government to cancel the licence of the defunct, expired and non-compliant,” said the regulator.
The regulator’s action came after the receipt of several complaints against the association. Following a reply from the PSA, a hearing was scheduled for October 10, 2023 to determine truth.
Secretary General Mohsin Shaukat did not turn up at several hearings and he finally appeared before the regulator on February 29, 2024. However, he failed to show any bank account through which he received his salary from the PSA.
During the course of the inquiry, it was established that the secretary general was a “dummy”. An inquiry committee noted that the “fake” secretary general was a direct shareholder in the affairs of the PSA.
He was also part of the management that was deemed a serious conflict of interest.
When contacted for comments, Mohsin Shaukat said that PSA’s lawyer was working on it and would share the verdict accordingly.
During the course of investigation, when inquiry committee members reached the PSA office during working hours, they found the office closed.
On a telephonic call, PSA chairman himself came and opened the office, which otherwise should have remained open for members and stakeholders.
The chairman was asked to produce documents related to Rule 22 of ToRs, which was a mandatory requirement of the law. However, he failed to provide such documents.
The association also failed to submit annual reporting requirements to the DGTO office for the year 2023 including the financial statements prepared by auditors and approved by the executive committee.
It could not submit the plan of activities for next year and a soft and hard copy of the list of its members as on November 30, 2023.
The inquiry committee, after returning to its office in Islamabad, examined the records and found a large number of irregularities.

In the energy sector, the project titled “Construction of 220kV Transmission Line (28km) along with 2nd Circuit Stringing of 132kV Transmission Line from Jiwani to Gwadar (94km) Revised,” worth Rs4,540.010 million, was approved by the forum. The project is proposed to be financed through the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
The main objective of the power sector is to provide uninterrupted power supply to consumers of all categories and to enhance the commercial viability of the sector as a whole. The proposed project involves the construction of grid stations aimed at providing and maintaining a fault-free high voltage system with minimum losses and expenditure.
The second project approved by the CDWP is related to the Physical Planning and Housing sector, titled “Gravity Based Safe Drinking Water Supply System in Havelian, Abbottabad, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P),” worth Rs3,336.20 million. The sponsoring agency for this project is the government of K-P. APP

6,Govt implements Ramazan export ban to stabilise prices,Temporary measure taken by cabinet ensures domestic supply of bananas and onions,"The government has implemented a temporary ban on the export of bananas and onions during Ramazan in response to rising prices.
In the National Assembly on Friday, Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan addressed concerns regarding the export ban, clarifying that it is specifically for Ramazan and is temporary.
The decision to impose the ban was made at the cabinet level following the submission of a summary by the Ministry of National Food Security and concerns raised by the Sensitive Price Index and export associations. This action was prompted by a calling attention notice raised by Syed Naveed Qamar and other legislators regarding the impact of the ban on agricultural exports.
Minister Jam Kamal Khan assured the assembly that the ban would remain in effect until the 15th of the following month, highlighting the government’s sensitivity to the concerns raised by agriculturists.
Read: Oil prices may be left unchanged in Ramazan
The temporary ban aims to ensure adequate domestic supply of these essential commodities during the holy month, alleviating concerns among the public and preventing a false perception of scarcity.
While the ban restricts export opportunities for farmers in the short term, it demonstrates the government’s proactive approach to managing food security during religious observances.
However, Kamal assured that the government is attentive to the concerns of agriculturists and indicated that the timeframe for the ban could be shortened if circumstances permit.

7,Rupee hits new 5-month high at 278.74/$,The currency received a boost from a $17 million increase in the country’s foreign exchange reserves (held by the SBP),"The Pakistani currency edged up to a new over five-month high at Rs278.74 against the US dollar in the interbank market, maintaining an uptick for the third consecutive working day, fuelled by relatively better supply of the greenback in the domestic economy.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency improved by Rs0.03 against the foreign currency on a day-to-day basis on Friday.
The local currency has cumulatively strengthened by 10.17% or Rs28.36 over the past six months compared to its all-time low of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023. The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported a Rs0.01 increase on a day-to-day basis, closing at Rs281.25/$ in the open market.

The currency received a boost from a $17 million increase in the country’s foreign exchange reserves (held by the SBP), which rose to $7.9 billion, according to the central bank’s weekly update on Thursday.
The increase in reserves confirms that the supply of foreign currency has remained higher than demand in the system, as exporters continued to sell higher amounts of US dollars on futures counters. Additionally, overseas Pakistanis maintained sending higher funds to their family members and friends in the homeland during the ongoing fasting month and ahead of the Eid festival.

8,IMF assured of power tariff hike,"Islamabad pledges tariff adjustments, privatisation of DISCOs to tackle woes","Pakistan has assured the International Monetary Fund of a timely increase in electricity prices, including the recovery of pending generation costs totalling over Rs210 billion – a move that may help the power sector achieve financial viability but at people’s expense.
Islamabad has also assured the global lender that it stands ready to hand over the power distribution companies to the private sector under concession agreements – a pledge that marks the first but necessary policy departure by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif constituted a committee to transfer these distribution companies to the provinces.
These assurances were given during the ongoing talks to reach a staff-level agreement for the release of the $1.1 billion loan tranche. Unlike in the past, this time the IMF did not encounter many issues while dealing with the Ministry of Energy.
Pakistan made these commitments to ensure the financial viability of the power sector. There is no particular requirement to increase the tariff solely for the sake of the last loan tranche, which will be disbursed next month subject to board approval.
The sources said that the Ministry of Energy apprised the global lender that Pakistan stands ready to implement the next annual base tariff adjustment. The Fund was told that the process to finalise the tariffs would be completed by June, and the adjustment would be made with effect from July.
It will be the third consecutive year that electricity prices would go up due to annual adjustments. During the past two years, the government had increased the average prices in the range of Rs7 per unit to Rs8 per unit. The annual adjustments are in addition to the monthly and quarterly price adjustments.
When contacted, an official of the Power Division said that it was premature to ascertain the exact quantum of the increase. He said that the power distribution companies have filed petitions with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), and any assessment can be made by the end of next month.
Government officials said that the level of circular debt and the amount of budget subsidies would be other determining factors for the price hike.
Read: Fertiliser industry urges uniform gas tariff
Despite multiple rounds of price increases, the electricity sector’s circular debt is around Rs2.7 trillion, including Rs378 billion added during the July-December period of this fiscal year.
The sources said that the IMF was also sensitive about the constant price hike. The Fund is now discussing measures with Pakistani authorities to reduce the cost of generation, including through power purchase agreement revisions.
The IMF pointed out the outstanding recoveries of over Rs210 billion on account of past power generation costs. The IMF was informed that the government was on track to recover the outstanding generation cost through the monthly and quarterly adjustments. Past recoveries will also be made through April tariff adjustments, they added.
The IMF also raised concerns about the government’s approach to the privatisation of the power distribution companies.
Pakistan authorities have assured the IMF that the government is committed to private sector participation in the management of the power distribution companies.
Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif set up a committee for transferring 10 power distribution companies to provinces, which was not in line with last month’s decision of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) that wanted to hand over those firms to the private sector.
During previous attempts to transfer ownership of power companies to provinces, only Sindh had shown willingness, and that too on the condition that the sector’s losses and obligations would remain the responsibility of the federal government.
The transfer of DISCOs to provinces will not solve the problem until it is decided to end the uniform tariff policy, under which an honest consumer of Islamabad pays for theft in Sukkur and Karachi.
The IMF was of the view that handing over the power distribution companies to provincial governments would not resolve the core issue of inefficiencies, the sources said.
However, the Fund was also concerned about any increase in electricity prices because of incentives to be offered to the private sector for investing in the distribution network.
The IMF has also asked Pakistan to hand over data related to the expiry of existing Power Purchase Agreements signed with various power generation companies. The IMF was of the view that any benefit arising out of expiry of the existing agreements should be used to reduce prices.
The IMF has also urged Pakistan to review its policy of providing locally subsidised gas to fertiliser plants – a policy that diverts resources away from the power sector, which relies on expensive imported gas and contributes to price increases.
Review talks are proceeding smoothly, and a staff-level agreement is expected next week.

9,Industrialists laud appointment of banker as finance minister,Urge autonomy for technocrats to drive policy reform and stability,"Industrialists view the appointment of an experienced banker like Federal Finance and Revenue Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as a revolutionary step that could soon alleviate the country’s economic woes. They urged the country’s top leadership to allow such technocrats to work independently without interference or hurdles.
In the past, technocrats in the cabinet were not given the autonomy to address challenges effectively, resulting in failures, they said. The industrialists emphasised the need for bold decisions in the country’s best interest to overcome multiple challenges and restore stability.
“If the government succeeds in sincerely and seriously facilitating industry and revamping both health and education sectors, they will win laurels soon and will be on the right track. Until there is some political stability, economic stability cannot come. Political stability can bring about economic stability,” said Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI) President Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani.

He believes that the finance minister, as a technocrat, can negotiate better terms with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) compared to a politician. Shaikhani notes that people are reluctant to invest in the country due to financial and energy crises, and technocrats like Aurangzeb can devise better economic policies suited to industrialists and business leaders.
“We will have to take austerity measures immediately and cut luxuries of the privileged class—bureaucracy—to save the national kitty from extra burdens of their luxury vehicles and magnificent offices-cum-residences. Pakistan is a beautiful and peaceful country for all businesses,” he added.
Pakistan Business Group (PBG) Chairman and Founder, and former president of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), Farazur Rahman believes that this decision highlights the government’s determination to tackle the country’s economic woes with expertise.
He highlighted that actions in the coming months will shape the trajectory of the country’s financial landscape. Rahman suggests that reducing energy prices will help develop industries like textiles and Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs). To alleviate external debt, he stresses the need to encourage foreign investments and support local industrialists.
Rahman asserted that the national economy cannot emerge from the crisis until the federal finance minister takes immediate steps to lower electricity and gas prices. He believes that if local industries continue to operate, the country’s revenue will also increase.
