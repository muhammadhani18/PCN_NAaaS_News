0,Man convicted for solemnizing second marriage without first wife's consent,"Family court sentences man to seven months imprisonment, imposes fine of Rs500,000","A family court sentenced a man in Lahore to seven months imprisonment, imposing a fine of Rs500,000, on Saturday for solemnizing a second marriage without the consent of his first wife.
“Muhammad Aurangzeb Khan accused is held guilty and convicted for the offence under section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961”, judge Adnan Liaqat’s maintained in his order.
Petitioner Zona Nasar stated in her complaint that she married Aurangzeb Khan on September 24, 2011. She contended that Khan contracted a second marriage without obtaining her consent thereby, violating the provisions outlined in the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance,1961.
The petitioner presented in court her marriage certificate, birth certificate, and B-Form of the couple's child as well as an attested copy of the accused's second marriage certificate. She also submitted testimonies from witnesses.

In his defense, the accused maintained that it was only after his first wife’s permission that he contracted the second marriage, adding that he did not conceal his marital status. Khan accused the prosecution witnesses of deposing against him falsely.
To back his claims, the accused produced a copy of a suit for dissolution of marriage, complaints of the wife’s alleged misconduct, and other documents.
His counsel argued that the accused contracted the marriage with his first wife’s verbal permission and that she was aware of it, but did not file any complaint earlier. He said the complainant did not produce her father and brother as witnesses during the trial, in front of whom she had given permission. He said the accused did not conceal his first marriage in the nikahnama of his second marriage, also denying evicting the complainant from their house.
However, after hearing detailed arguments and in light of the evidence produced, the court convicted the husband after guilt was proved on his part.

1,SBP denies reports of issuing polymer currency notes,"Central bank calls reports 'baseless', asserts 'no such plan underway'","The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) denied reports, circulating on social media and news channels, that it was issuing a new series of polymer currency notes. 
In a statement on Saturday, the central bank refuted the reports as 'unfounded and lacking merit'. According to the SBP, there are currently no plans or proposals to transition from paper to plastic (polymer) currency notes.

The statement emphasised that the utilization of cotton-based paper for currency production remains the standard, with materials primarily sourced locally from Security Papers Limited – which uses mainly local raw materials.
The reports regarding the issuance of polymer currency notes come days after the recent controversy about the misprinting of Rs1,000 notes in circulation.
A one-minute video went viral earlier this week, showing no printing on the backside of a few Rs1,000 notes. The video maker, who did not appear on camera but identified himself with his voice in the background as a National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) branch manager in Model Colony, Karachi, displayed the misprinted notes in his hand.
A spokesperson for SBP – later on Wednesday - said that commercial banks and individuals who have received the one-sided printed notes can exchange them at the bank branches where they received the faulty notes. They can also exchange the notes at the designated 16 offices of the central bank nationwide.

5,AI urges 'immediate' restoration of X in Pakistan,"Criticises ‘complete silence’ of PTA, demands repeal of laws such as Section 37 of PECA","Amnesty International, along with a coalition of human rights activists and civil society organisations, has called for the immediate restoration of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), blocked in the country since February 17.
X has been inaccessible since former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha resigned over what he said was alleged “election rigging” in the Rawalpindi division.
The platform ban came after the blockage of mobile phone services on election day - February 8.
""The arbitrary blocking of platforms, including the prolonged and unannounced disruption of ""X"" (formerly known as Twitter) since 17 February 2024, is a sobering illustration of growing digital censorship in the country,"" said the statement.
The international non-governmental human rights organisation's statement highlighted the detrimental impact of internet shutdowns and social media platform blocking on political discourse and the free flow of information, particularly in the lead-up to and following crucial electoral processes.
""Such actions not only silence diverse political voices but also create an environment which contributes to the spread of misinformation.""
The Amnesty International statement comes amidst mounting concerns over the erosion of freedom of expression and access to information in the country.
The human rights organisation also criticised the ""complete silence of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA)"" and termed it extremely alarming as the authority failed to furnish any reasons for the ban and ""exceeded its mandate to block an entire internet platform"".
Read X factor: Twitter ban hits businesses, news in Pakistan
""The absence of transparency in the decision-making processes surrounding network shutdowns and platform blocking and complete disregard for any accountability has resulted in an obvious erosion of trust between the state and its citizens,"" added the statement.
Elaborating on the concerns, the organisation said the reported throttling of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) further impedes people's access to information and infringes upon their right to privacy.
Amnesty International and its partners called for immediate action to reverse the course of digital censorship in Pakistan.
Specifically, Amnesty International urged the government to unblock X, repeal censorship-enabling laws such as Section 37 of The Prevention of Electronic Crime Act(PECA), and act transparently on decisions impacting internet usage for political and economic purposes.
Additionally, the human rights organisation and other signatories of the statement demanded a clarification outlining the legal basis for recent platform blockages and a commitment to upholding Pakistan's international obligations to freedom of expression and access to information.
The incoming government, regulators, and public bodies were implored to recognise the enduring impact of actions that restrict the flow of information and impede citizens' ability to express themselves, particularly concerning political participation.
Pakistan entered on Saturday its fourth week of nationwide disruption to social media platform X, with activists waging a court battle to get it restored.

7,PR runs world’s longest freight train,"It boasts length of 2,500 feet and comprises 50 coaches"," 
The Pakistan Railways has set a record by running the world’s longest freight train that boasted an impressive length of over 2,500 feet and comprised a whopping 50 coaches, its spokesperson said on Friday.
The spokesperson added that the freight train was propelled by a formidable GE U40 locomotive engine.
He said this train journey commenced from Karachi, carrying a staggering load of over 3,000 tons of cargo, destined for Kotri.
“This monumental initiative not only signifies a breakthrough for Pakistan Railways but also promises substantial benefits for the nation,” he added.
Despite its colossal size, the freight train achieved remarkable speeds, attaining a top speed of 60-km per hour and maintaining an impressive average speed of 38-km per hour throughout its journey.
Similarly, the spokesperson said the sheer scale of the freight vehicle's capacity was awe-inspiring, capable of accommodating goods equivalent to that of more than 94 22-wheeler trucks.
By transferring such massive quantities of cargo via rail, the spokesperson said the endeavor was poised to alleviate the burden on road traffic significantly, easing congestion and enhancing transportation efficiency across the country.
Moreover, he said the shift towards rail transport for freight purposes aligns with the global efforts towards environmental preservation, as it effectively reduces pollution and carbon emissions associated with traditional road transport methods.

8,Court set to hear Nawaz sons' plea on 19th,"Accountability court gives NAB three more days to prepare arguments, submit record"," 
An accountability court in Islamabad has given the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) until March 19 to prepare arguments and submit records of the references in which former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s sons, Hassan and Hussain, were co-accused.
Islamabad Accountability Court-I Judge Nasir Javed Rana resumed hearing Hassan and Hussain's plea for their acquittal in the Flagship, Al-Azizia, and Avenfield references on Friday.
Advocate Qazi Misbah appeared on behalf of Hassan and Hussain along with the pleader of the accused, Rana Irfan. Hassan and Hussain had requested exemption from attending Friday's hearing, a request which the court accepted.
Prosecutors Afzal Qureshi, Sohail Arif, and Mirza Usman appeared in court on behalf of NAB. They requested the court to grant them time to prepare arguments as well as present the relevant record. The court granted NAB time until March 19.
A day earlier, on Thursday, Hassan and Hussain received significant relief as the accountability court revoked its earlier order declaring them proclaimed offenders and canceled their permanent arrest warrants.

Hassan and Hussain had returned to Pakistan on March 12 after the same judge suspended their arrest warrants on March 7.
They were named as accused along with Nawaz Sharif in all three references—the Avenfield case, the Flagship case, and the Al-Azizia case—filed by NAB in July 2017 on the order of the Supreme Court following the Panama Papers scandal.
As the brothers, who live in the United Kingdom, did not attend the legal proceedings, the courts that heard these cases had declared them proclaimed offenders and issued permanent arrest warrants.
Last year, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) acquitted Nawaz Sharif in both the Avenfield and Al-Azizia cases on November 29 and December 12, 2023, respectively. Meanwhile, NAB withdrew its appeal against an accountability court’s verdict to acquit Nawaz in the Flagship reference.
During the hearing on Friday, Judge Nasir Javed Rana told the lawyers that he has the charge of Islamabad Accountability Court-I and -III, while he is also the duty judge for Islamabad Accountability Court-II. “The charge for Accountability Court-II has also been assigned to me. The notification will be issued today,"" he said.

9,IMF office: PTI distances itself from protests,Imran says protests 'right' but unaware of 'anti-military slogans',"In the wake of protests spearheaded by overseas Pakistanis in the United States, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has distanced his party from the ongoing demonstrations abroad, clarifying that it had no involvement in the rallies outside the headquarters of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Addressing the media outside Adiala Jail, following a hearing on the 190 million NCA scandal case against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, Barrister Gohar stated, ""If overseas Pakistanis are making up something, then it would be their own decision.""
He said there was no directive to prevent aid to Pakistan in the letter to the IMF. Instead, the focus was on ensuring clean and transparent elections.
On the other hand, in an informal conversation with journalists within the courtroom at Adiala Jail, Imran Khan commented on the IMF protest, terming it ‘right’ but claiming ignorance regarding any anti-army sloganeering that may have occurred during the demonstration.
His clarification came a day after several PTI workers from the overseas chapter staged protests outside the IMF and WB headquarters in Washington, alleging irregularities in the 2024 general elections in Pakistan. The protest in the US also saw the presence of former PM Imran's ex-chief of staff Shahbaz Gill and PTI spokesperson in the United States, Sajjad Burki.
Organised by ""First Pakistan Global,"" the demonstration accused PTI of having its National Assembly seats reduced from 180 to 90 in the general elections.
The protests drew criticism from the Pakistani government, particularly at a time when the country was seeking another bailout package from the global lender to address economic challenges.

Responding to queries, the PTI chairman clarified that while the party did not request the IMF to halt financial aid to Pakistan, it did urge the global lender to reconsider its commitments to free and fair elections and transparent fund allocations.
Amid reports of internal strife within PTI over its alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), Barrister Gohar reaffirmed the seriousness of the merger, stating it was the best decision given the circumstances. He highlighted the importance of securing reserved seats amidst the loss of the party's ""bat"" symbol.
""We sought protection not only for reserved seats but also to prevent defections by merging with a political party,"" Barrister Gohar asserted.
Expressing confidence in the Supreme Court (SC) to deliver justice, Barrister Gohar elaborated on PTI's pursuit of 80 seats, including 67 reserved for women and 11 for minorities. He announced plans to seek an interpretation of Article 51 of the
Constitution regarding the allocation of reserved seats.
Furthermore, Barrister Gohar revealed intentions to challenge the Peshawar High Court's (PHC) decision upholding the Election
Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) ruling denying reserved seats to PTI, indicating an impending legal battle in the apex court.
He said that Asad Qaiser never said that the resolution in favour of Palestine would not be allowed in the National Assembly, adding that this is a misunderstanding which may have happened due to the noise in the house. On the resolution on Women's Day, he said women who are enduring prosecution should also be highlighted.
Gohar said we are trying to strengthen the faith in democracy and ensure that money is not spent in the Senate election.
He further said that the secrecy of the vote in the Senate election should be maintained and that the ECP should oversee the procedure for verifying this vote.
