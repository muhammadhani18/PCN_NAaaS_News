KARACHI: Defying hurdles erected by police and arrests of workers, a large number of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf workers staged a rally on Sunday evening and demanded that party founder Imran Khan be released from prison immediately. 
The PTI had initially announced a rally from its headquarters Insaf House on Sharea Faisal to Mazar-i-Quaid. However, before the start of the event a heavy contingent of police cordoned off the area and made the event almost impossible.
A PTI spokesperson, Moha­mmed Ali Bozdar, claimed that the police detained over 20 workers from Hassan Square, Sachal, Korangi, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Sharea Faisal and other areas. 
However, police sources denied arrest of any PTI worker. 
A senior official, who wished not to be named, said that they just ‘prevented’ the activists from taking out the rally from Insaf House as they did not have any permission from the district administration.
It all started in the second half of the day when PTI leaders led by its Sindh chapter president Haleem Adil Sheikh and senior vice president Sher Afzal Marwat, who landed in Karachi specially to attend the event, assembled at Insaf House to find heavy contingent of police surrounding the area. 
Within next few minutes, the police blocked both tracks of Sharea Faisal to stop the rally from taking off, which caused a gridlock on the key thoroughfare. 
However, PTI workers defied police arrangements, upon which the police detained a number of activists promoting strong protest from the party on main Sharea Faisal. 
“We had announced the rally several days ago,” said Haleem Adil Sheikh while talking to reporters. 
“All of a sudden the police jumped in and placed hurdles on our route without mentioning any reason. They harassed our workers, arrested them and moved them to Baloch Colony police station. What kind of democracy is this? It’s worse than dictatorship. But let me be very clear. We won’t stop. Peaceful protest is our right and we will exercise it at every cost.” 
The protest followed talks between police authorities and PTI leaders that led to release of party workers, a PTI spokesman said. 
Finally, the rally started from Sharea Faisal and reached its destination by sunset, during which it was joined by number of other rallies form other parts of the city. 
Addressing the rally, the leaders vowed to continue their struggle for a ‘true democratic state’ with rule of law and where people “would be free to choose their rulers”. 
“The people of Karachi have proved again that they’re only with Imran Khan and they can’t be scared off such illegal tactics,” said Mr Marwat while addressing the rally. 
“The mandate of Karachi and entire Pakistan belongs to Imran Khan and anyone who wishes to minus Imran Khan from the country’s politics actually lives in fool’s paradise. Today’s massive rally and this sea of people is message to all those forces that they can no more keep Imran Khan behind the bars.” 
Haleem Adil in his address said that the Sunday’s event was only a ‘trailer’ for the upcoming power show on April 28 in Karachi. 
“The people of Karachi would come out again on April 28 for another massive rally which would be in Bagh-i-Jinnah,” he said. 
“Karachi’s residents have consistently supported the PTI. In 2024 elections, the people witnessed massive rigging through which all of our Karachi seats were taken away. The people now demand accountability for the theft of mandate. This forthcoming rally in Karachi will be monumental.”

5,"After Punjab, people of Sindh await drop in roti prices",Price of flour No2.5 reduced to Rs96 per kg from Rs122 a kilo,"KARACHI: While the Punjab government has reduced roti prices in order to provide relief to its people, citizens are awaiting a drop in prices of naan after a sharp reduction in prices of different varieties of flour in Sindh. 
A week ago, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cut the rate of roti and naan, fixing the price of a 100 gram roti at Rs16 and of 120g naan at Rs20.
However, the Sindh government and the Karachi commissioner have yet to take  notice of delay in price reduction of various roti varieties. 
While millers have slashed the prices of flour No2.5, Maida (super fine flour)  and fine flour, tandoor operators appear to be not ready to pass on the benefit of reduction in flour prices to people after a bumper wheat crop and its massive import in the country.

Price of flour No2.5 reduced to Rs96 per kg from Rs122 a kilo

Amid inaction from the government, consumers are paying high prices of chapatti, which is selling at Rs15-20 per piece, Naan at Rs25-30, and Sheermal and Taftaan at Rs80-90. 
Speaking to Dawn, most consumers criticise the performance of the commissioner regarding outright profiteering by retailers of fruit, grocery, vegetables, bakery and confectionery items during Ramazan.  
They say they are expecting a massive reduction in roti prices after a drop throughout the country.  
On the other hand, tandoor owners in various areas warn that if the government tries to enforce any kind of pressure on them to sell roti varieties at reduced rates without any homework on “soaring production cost”, they may shut down their operations in protest.  
Flour prices 
Millers have slashed the prices of flour No2.5, Maida (super fine flour) and fine flour to Rs96 per kg, Rs123 and Rs124 from Rs122, Rs136 and Rs140 per kg prevailing in February 2024, respectively.  
Similarly, the wholesale prices of flour No.2.5 is now Rs97 per kg as against Rs123 per kg while Maida and fine flour are selling at Rs122 instead of Rs133 per kg.  
Chairman of Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association Rauf Ibrahim has expressed surprise as to why the commissioner of Karachi is still reluctant to issue new revised rates of various flour varieties after downward trajectory in their ex-mill and wholesale rates.  
He has also said that the commissioner seems unaware that the wheat flour rate has plunged below the commissioner Karachi’s wholesale and retail rates of Rs123 and Rs128 per kg.  
The delay in revising down the flour rates is encouraging retailers to easily charge extra rupees from consumers based on higher official rates.  
Lack of interest by the price regulator has also given a free hand to bakery and confectionary item makers to continue to charge high rates from consumers on items in which Maida and fine flour are extensively used.  
Rauf Ibrahim says market retailers are selling chakki flour at Rs150-160 per kg while its price should come down to Rs135 per kg.  
Shopkeepers are still demanding Rs130-150 per kg for flour No.2.5, Maida and fine flour.  
The chairman of wholesalers and grocers body also says that low weight tandoori Naan should be sold at Rs15-16 per piece, while higher weight Naan should be available at Rs20 per piece and Chapati price should not exceed Rs12 depending on the weight after the price cut in flour.  
It is also seen that most consumers also do not bother about the weight of roti which provides opportunity to tandoors to sell lesser weight roti at higher rate.   
Tandoor owners claim that chapati is 80-90 grams while Naan carries a weight of 160-170 grams.  
They say that it is true that the price of flour has come down, but the issue of non-availability of subsidised natural gas has forced them to opt for costly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), whose price is Rs260 per kg.  
One can calculate the price of filling a 45kg LPG cylinder at this rate.  
They say the price of electricity has more than doubled in the last few years.  
A number of tandoor owners are using white paper to wrap roti, which costs Rs300 per kg instead of old newspapers which are cheaper.  
They say the price of plastic shopping bag is Rs350-450 per kg depending on quality, while labour charges and sugar rates have also been increased.  
Many tandoors are operating on rental spaces whose prices have also touched the roof.  
They say that many tandoor operators are using generators in the event of loadshedding, which are run on petrol and diesel whose rates have also gone up.  
They have urged the government to first take stock of the situation regarding production cost and other rising expenses in running tandoors before making any ‘unilateral’ decision of announcing any cut in Roti rates.  
Wheat price after massive import 
A huge import of wheat of around 3.5 million tonnes costing one billion dollars from September-March 2024 by the private sector has brought down wheat rate to Rs8,200-8,300 per 100kg bag from Rs10,800 a few months back thus making a strong case for price cut in flour varieties.  
Besides Sindh wheat crop is also available at Rs8,500 per 100kg bag as compared to Rs9,500 earlier in the month.  
However, the millers have taken too much time to reduce the rates of flour despite import of cheaper wheat from Ukraine and Russia followed by strong rupee against the dollar in the above period, making landed cost of imported grain lower.  
Chairman of Cereal Association of Pakistan Muzammil Chappal said the government’s timely decision to allow import of wheat by the private sector without involving any subsidy had kept wheat prices stable in local markets besides averting any grain shortage.  
He said Pakistan had to import wheat due to a low wheat crop of 27 million tonnes in 2023 as against the consumption of 31mn tonnes.  
Wheat import was allowed till February 2024 but later on, the government had extended till March 2024 due to some disturbances in the Red and Black Sea, he added.

6,"This week 50 years ago: Z A Bukhari, struggle against imperialism and insecticides","Z A BUKHARI was a broadcasting giant and a noteworthy poet. A celebrity of in his own right, he introduced and...","Z A BUKHARI was a broadcasting giant and a noteworthy poet. A celebrity of in his own right, he introduced and trained a decent number of artists at Radio Pakistan where he worked for a long stretch of time. On April 22, 1974 it was reported that Z A Bukhari had returned to Karachi from the United Kingdom after receiving treatment at a clinic in London. The former director-general of Radio Pakistan had a heart attack on Jan 2 and was taken to the Cardiovascular Disease Hospital in the city. He was subsequently flown to London for a specialist treatment where he stayed for almost eight weeks.
Bukhari sahib was also well versed in the art of public speaking. In those days, the spirit of activism and the ability to speak well in public could be found in individuals belonging to professions related to the well-being of mankind. On April 24, Karachi’s journalists at a meeting resolved to fight against imperialism and colonialism in order to establish a progressive socioeconomic order. In a resolution adopted on the occasion of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, the Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) reaffirmed its determination to struggle against imperialism in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Shen Pe-wen of the Consulate of the People’s Republic of China was the chief guest at the meeting. The speakers included: Zafar Rizvi, Abdul Habib Khan Ghouri, Abdul Hameed Chapra, Inam Durrani and Hasan Abidi.
The question of ‘resolve’, albeit in a different manner, came under scrutiny on April 23 as well when the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) waged an ‘air-attack’ on mosquitoes on an experimental basis by spraying insecticides from a light aircraft over three main mosquito-breeding grounds in the city. It was the first ever aerial spray in the metropolis which was carried out in the morning covering Mahmoodabad, PECHS Block 6 (from Baloch Colony to Korangi Road) and Defence Housing Society. The campaign cost the KMC Rs20,000 for 500 acres apart from the expenditure on field operations. The KMC believed if 80 per cent of the desired results were achieved, it would be a good investment since it was not possible to go for spraying manually from the ground.
Two days later, on April 25, satisfactory results were claimed by the KMC from aerial spraying of insecticides. According to a report, 80pc of mosquito-larvae were killed and mortality among adult mosquitoes was encouraging, too. The effect of the drive on the first day was not high but on the second day the percentage increased considerably. However, an examination of several ponds in residential areas showed that the campaign was ineffective because of the high velocity of the wind.
Speaking of numbers, on April 27, more than 1500 students of Karachi College for Women boycotted classes as a protest against the transfer of seven lecturers of the institution. They gathered on college premises where they expressed their resentment at the order of transfer issued to the teachers. They appealed to the chief minister of Sindh, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, to intervene and direct the Education Department to withdraw the order.

8,Karachi ATC acquits Lyari gangster in explosives case for ‘lack of evidence’,"However, Nisar Ahmed alias Mullah Nisar will remain behind bars since he is facing trial in over 40 cases, his lawyer says.","KARACHI: An antiterrorism court has acquitted a suspected gangster in a case pertaining to possession of explosives, illicit weapons and an attack on a raiding party of law enforcement agencies for lack of evidence.
Nisar Ahmed alias Mullah Nisar— said to be initially associated with chief of the outlawed Peoples Amn Committee and the Lyari kingpin Uzair Baloch but later parted ways due to some differences — was charged with allegedly attacking the personnel of law enforcement agencies when they raided in a Lyari locality to arrest the accused and his accomplices in January 2014.
After conducting the trial and recording the evidence of witnesses as well as final arguments from both sides, the ATC-III judge exonerated the accused for lack of evidence.
However, he will remain behind bars since his lawyer stated that he is facing trial in over 40 cases. So far, he has been acquitted in seven cases. 
According to the prosecution, acting on a tip-off, Rangers and police had conducted a raid near Bakra Piri in Lyari on January 24, 2014. The accused along with his accomplices had opened fire at the personnel of paramilitary force as well as police and a suspect, Aslam, was killed in the shootout while Mullah Nisar along with some other suspects had managed to escape.
A case was registered at the Kalakot police station against the accused and his accomplices under several provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, Explosive Substances Act and Anti-Terrorism Act as the police said that explosives and illicit weapons were found from the slain suspect.
The prosecution further maintained that the accused was a key character of the Lyari gang warfare and had been arrested in December 2022 during a joint operation of Rangers and police when he returned home from a neighbouring country to organise his gang while he was involved in several cases of targeted killings, police encounters, terrorism, extortion, etc.
Defence counsel Abid Zaman said that the court acquitted the accused in the present case since the prosecution had failed to establish the charges beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt.

9,Dacoit carrying Rs2m head money gunned down in Shikarpur,Two hostages freed in other police operations,"SUKKUR: Shikarpur police on Sunday claimed to have killed three dacoits, including ‘SP Tegho’, one of the most-wanted bandits carrying Rs2m head money, and wounded his associate during encounters at different places on previous night. They also claimed to have rescued two hostages and recovered two snatched cars during the actions.
Shikarpur SSP Irfarn Ali Samoo told Dawn over phone that police had received information that a gang of dacoits was travelling by a car, which was passing through a section of the Dakhan link road within the limits of the Madeji police station. He said that police rushed to the specified spot and challenged the gangsters but they opened fire, which was returned. During the encounter, two dacoits were killed on the spot, he said, adding that the weapons and car used by the outlaws were taken into custody after the encounter.
The bodies were shifted to the taluka hospital for a postmortem examination.

Two hostages freed in other police operations 

Later, the deceased outlaws were identified as Ali Jan Sabzoi and Rafique alias Rafu Jafferi, believed to be associated with Nisar Sabzoi and Arslan Sabzoi gangs, the SSP said.
The police officer said that in the kutcha area of Garhi Tegho, a police team gunned down a dreaded dacoit, ‘SP Tegho’, who carried Rs2m head money.
It was an intelligence-based targeted action, the SSP said, pointing out that such actions were under way against criminal gangs and their facilitators in the riverine areas.
Local reporters, however, claimed that SP Tegho and a passer-by, Amjad, were killed in a clash between two rival communities of the Garhi Tegho riverine area. Five other persons were wounded in the gun battle during which sophisticated heavy weapons were used by both sides, they said.
In yet another encounter, two dacoits, Nawab Teghani and Aijaz, were wounded in a similar action, the SSP said.
Two hostages recovered
SSP Samoon said that the Naparkot police safely rescued two hostages, Imran Pahor and Channesar Pahor, who were kidnaped about a month ago from the Karampur Laro (turning) in Kandhkot.
They were escorted to the area’s police station and would be handed over to their families after legal formalities, he said.
Meanwhile, Kandhkot police and Rangers personnel killed a dacoit in a joint operation during which several hideouts of the outlaws were torched and destroyed in the riverine area of Khair Shah, within the limits of the B-Section police on Saturday night and Sunday. Several snatched motorcycles were recovered during the operation, they said.
The Kandhkot police said the wanted dacoit, Sanwal Mohammadani, was wounded in the action and transported to the taluka hospital, where doctors referred him to the Sukkur Civil Hospital due to his precarious condition. He, however, succumbed to his wounds during treatment, the police said.

The seminar was held under the ‘Sindhri Mango GI Project’ at the Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam, the other day.  Dr Inayatullah Rajpar, Dean of Faculty of Crop Production,  discussed swift global recognition of various indigenous products and  critical role of GI registration in maintaining their quality and standards. 
“We must play a positive role in earning global acclaim for  countless indigenous products in Sindh, including Sindhri mango from  Mirpurkhas, henna from Mehar and Tharo Shah, Kunri’s chilies, Mehar  city’s barfi, Hyderabad’s bangles, Khairpur’s dates, Larkana’s  guava etc,” he added. 
Peter Damary, international consultant for Sindhri mango GI  project, highlighted merits of geographical indication registration for  numerous Pakistani products including those from Sindh.  
He said that establishing a “Made in Pakistan” standard for the  indigenous products could serve as a potential economic tool for  promoting and boosting both national and international trade, enabling  Pakistani products to be marketed at premium prices. 
National consultant for the project, Ms Noor Asfia,  said that over 200 products were ideal for global branding. “It is  imperative for us to consider how rest of the world is progressing  rapidly. In this regard, academia and industry must play their  respective roles,” she stated.  
She noted that Kunri, a town in Sindh, contributed 83pc to the  country’s chilies exports and three per cent to global exports of the commodity. Hyderabad city’s bangles were registered under the GI following which India’s Hyderabad Deccan also got itself registered, she said. 
The university’s advanced studies director, Dr Abdul Mubeen  Lodhi, stated that besides agricultural products, items such as Sindhi  caps, handicrafts and culture-related products could also qualify for GI  registration. 
SAU vice chancellor’s adviser on academic affairs Dr  Ziaul Hassan Shah, and ORIC director Dr Tanveer Fatima Miano also  spoke at the programme. 
The event witnessed a large number of faculty and  students.  
Earlier, the team visited various faculties including Malir and Horticulture mango orchards.

He in a press statement said that the HCCI wanted action against Hesco on the pattern of the measures being taken against the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) as per disclosure of Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.  
He said that traders and businessmen of Hyderabad had long been protesting against Hesco’s poor performance in Hyderabad, the province’s second largest and industrialised city. 
He said the interior minister had recently expressed his concern over overbilling by Lesco and entrusted an inquiry to the FIA vowing to put an end to the practice. “We demand a similar inquiry against Hesco because we are also highly concerned about overbilling. Traders and members of the business community of Hyderabad are already protesting against Hesco’s performance,” he said, adding that they had been burdened with fuel price adjustment charges and other taxes, besides electricity tariff. A decline in industrial activities was being caused by power distribution companies (Discos) and it was right time the federal government introduced reforms in the companies to ensure promotion of industrial activities, he said.
Mr Siddiqui said that unannounced loadshedding was imposed routinely due to “criminal negligence” of Hesco staff and management which had a bad impact on industrial growth.  
Besides, he said, bona fide consumers who were good paymasters were slapped with detection bills. In addition to these issues Hesco had started overbilling to the tune of 30 to 100 units in each bill for industrial and commercial sectors as well as poor consumers every month. According to a safe estimate, industrial and commercial sector consumers would have to bear the burden of billions of electricity units, he said. 
He said that the situation was leading to serious unrest among business community members. He strongly condemned overbilling by Hesco.  
He urged the federal energy minister to take immediate notice of Hesco’s unfair practices and take practical measures to save the industrial sector from collapse.
