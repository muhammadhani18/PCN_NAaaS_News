0,50 more bodies found at hospital in Gaza’s Khan Younis,14 killed in occupied West Bank; Netanyahu vows to fight possible US sanctions.,"• Gaza death toll nears 35,000
• 14 killed in occupied West Bank
• Netanyahu vows to fight possible US sanctions
GAZA: Health workers have uncovered at least 50 bodies of people killed and buried by Israeli forces at a hospital, in the southern city of Khan Younis.
But while Israeli military said it was checking reports about the  recovery of 50 bodies, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared far  from being willing to respect the United Nations resolution calling for a  ceasefire, saying he would fight against sanctions being imposed on any  Israeli army units.
Israel’s invasion has so far killed 34,097 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
Separately, the Palesti­nian Red Crescent said on Saturday that at least 14 people  were killed during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli army said it killed 10 people during the operation at Nur Shams camp.
Another mass grave
“Inside the Nasser Medical Complex  there are mass graves dug by the Israeli occupation … we were shocked  by the presence of bodies of 50 martyrs in one of the pits yesterday,”  said Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the Gaza civil defence agency.
“We  are continuing the search operation today and are waiting for all  graves to be exhumed in order to give a final number of martyrs.”
He said some of those killed had been tortured.
“There were no clothes on some bodies, which certainly indicates (the victims) faced torture and abuse,” Mr Bassal said.
In  a separate statement, Hamas condemned the “mass grave of those executed  in cold blood and buried with military bulldozers in the hospital’s  courtyard”.
It said more than 50 bodies had been recovered there.
Several  of the bodies wrapped in white shrouds were later collected by  relatives, said an AFP photographer who reported that civil defence  workers were seen exhuming bodies from the courtyard on Sunday.
Israel carried out deadly strikes in Gaza, first responders in the war-battered Palestinian territory said, as violence flared in the  occupied West Bank.
The bodies of 13 people, mostly children,  were recovered after an Israeli strike hit the home of a family near the  southernmost Gaza city of Rafah, the agency said. Other people were  believed to be under rubble.
A separate Israeli strike on a home  in the Rafah area killed at least three people and wounded others, the  civil defence agency said.
Resident Umm Hassan Kloub, 35, said her children screamed when they “woke up to a nightmare of an explosion”.
“Every second we live in terror, even the sound of Israeli aircraft doesn’t stop,” she said.
“We don’t know whether we will live or die. This is not life.”
Netanyahu vows to resist sanctions
On Saturday, Axios news site reported that Washington was planning to impose sanctions on Israel’s Netzah Yehuda battalion for rights violations during an operation in the occupied West Bank.
“If anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit of the IDF, I will fight it with all my strength,” Neta­nyahu said in a statement.
His remarks came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hinted at such steps when asked by a reporter in Italy about reports that his department had recommended cuts in military aid to an Israeli unit involved in violent incidents in the occupied West Bank.

2,‘Once a century’ floods to hit southern China,• Emergency plans activated to safeguard 127m people from imminent flooding • Officials warn of record water levels in,"• Emergency plans activated to safeguard 127m people from imminent flooding
• Officials warn of record water levels in key river basins
BEIJING: Severe floods “seen around once a century” are expected to hit parts of southern China, state media said Sunday, as heavy rains prompted authorities to step up disaster precautions.
Major rivers, waterways and reservoirs in Guangdong province are threatening to unleash dangerous floods, forcing the government on Sunday to enact emergency response plans to protect more than 127 million people.
Calling the situation “grim”, local weather officials said sections of rivers and tributaries at the Xijiang and Beijiang river basins are hitting water levels in a rare spike that only has a one-in-50 chance of happening in any given year, state broadcaster CCTV news said on Sunday.
Guangdong officials urged departments in all localities and municipalities to begin emergency planning to avert natural disasters and promptly disperse disaster relief funds and materials to ensure affected people have food, clothing, water and a place to live.
The province, a major exporter and one of China’s main commercial and trading centres, has seen torrid downpours for several days and strong winds due to severe convective weather, which has also affected other parts of China.
A 12-hour stretch of heavy rain, starting from 8pm on Saturday, battered the central and northern parts of the province in the cities of Zhaoqing, Shaoguan, Qingyuan and Jiangmen.
Almost 20,000 people have been evacuated in Qingyuan, according to state media, and some power facilities in Zhaoqing were damaged, cutting power to some places.
About 1,103 schools in Zhaoqing, Shaoguan and Qingyuan will suspend classes on Monday, Chinese state radio said.  
Raging muddy flood waters swept one vehicle down a narrow street in Zhaoqing, showed a video released by Hongxing News.
Authorities in Qingyuan and Shaoguan also suspended ships from travelling through several rivers. Many hydrological stations in the province are exceeding water levels, weather officials warned, and in the provincial capital Guangzhou, a city of 18 million, reservoirs have reached flood limits, city officials announced on Sunday.
Data showed 2,609 hydrological stations with daily rainfall greater than 50mm, accounting for about 59pc of all observation stations.
In neighbouring Guangxi, west of Guangdong, violent hurricane-like winds whipped the region, destroying buildings state media video footage showed. Some places have also experienced hailstones and major flooding, CCTV said.
As of 10am, 65 landslides were recorded in the city of Hezhou located in Guangxi, state media reported. Landslides injured at least six people and trapped others, state media reported on Sunday.
CCTV said on Sunday that rains had sparked landslides affecting six villages in the northern Guangdong town of Jiangwan, “causing people to become trapped”.
No deaths were immediately reported and the total number of trapped people was not specified.
Weather forecasters are expecting heavy rain through Monday in Guangxi region, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces.

3,One killed in Kabul attack claimed by IS,"“The sticky bomb was planted on a minibus,” Kabul police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said in a statement.","KABUL: One person was killed and three others were wounded in an explosion in Kabul, Afghan police said on Sunday, with the Islamic State group claiming responsibility for the sticky bomb attack.
The improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated in the Kot-i-Sangi neighbourhood, near an enclave of the historically persecuted Shia Hazara community, which has been targeted by the militant group in the past. “The sticky bomb was planted on a minibus,” Kabul police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said in a statement late on Saturday.
“The driver of the vehicle lost his life, and three other civilians were injured.” Security personnel were investigating the incident, the statement added.
The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility on its Telegram channel, saying a minibus carrying Hazaras was blown up as it passed through a Taliban checkpoint. The attack “led to its destruction and the killing and wounding of around 10” people, the IS statement said.
The number of bombings and suicide attacks in Afghanistan has reduced dramatically since the Afghan Taliban ended their insurgency after ousting the US-backed government and returning to power in August 2021. But several armed groups, including IS, remain a threat.

4,Khamenei praises ‘success’ of military after attack on Israel,Says armed forces proved the emergence of the power of the Iranian nation’s determination at the international level.,"TEHRAN: In his first public comments since Tehran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday  praised country’s armed forces for their  “success”.
Khamenei praised the armed forces, in a meeting with Iranian military commanders, for their  “success in recent events”, a week after the country’s first-ever direct attack on Israel from its own territory.
“The armed forces showed a good image of their abilities and power and an admirable image of the Iranian nation,” Khamenei said.
“They also proved the emergence of the power of the Iranian nation’s determination at the international level.”
“The armed forces’ recent achievements have created a sense of splendour and magnificence about Islamic Iran in the eyes of the world,” Khamenei said in quotes posted on his official X account.
 






Israel claimed it intercepted 99 per cent of the more than 300 drones and missiles fired at it, with the aid of the United States and other allies and that those which got through caused only minor damage.
Addressing his country’s attack on Israel, Khamenei said  “the issue of the number of missiles fired or the missiles that hit the target” was  “secondary”.
“The main issue is the emergence of the willpower of the Iranian nation and the armed forces in the international arena,” he said, according to his official website.
Khamenei thanked the country’s armed forces  for the attack, saying the country had  demonstrated its power.
“In the recent operation, the  armed forces managed to minimise costs and maximise gains,” he added, urging military officials to  “ceaselessly pursue military  innovation and learn the enemy’s tactics”.

5,Seven go missing after choppers collide in Japan,One crew member dies shortly after being rescued,"TOKYO: Two Japanese military helicopters apparently collided before crashing into the sea, leaving at least one crew member dead and seven others missing on Sunday, officials said.
The crew member was initially rescued, but he did not survive, according to a spokesman for Japan’s Self-Defense Force (SDF) who confirmed the late Saturday incident to AFP.
The helicopters appear to have crashed during night-time training of countering submarines off the Izu Islands in the Pacific Ocean, officials said. 
Defence Minister Minoru Kihara said rescuers “spotted what are believed to be part of the aircraft in the sea, and we believe that the two helicopters crashed”. 

One crew member dies shortly after being rescued

“At this point, the cause is unknown, but firstly we do our best to save lives,” he said before he told the media that the crew member who was rescued “was confirmed dead”. 
The minister said the authorities “discovered the flight recorders in places close to each other,” and so “possibility is high that [the two helicopters] collided.” 
“The flight recorders are being analysed” while officials are interviewing crew of a third helicopter that was joining the drill but was not involved in the accident, chief of staff Ryo Sakai of the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) told reporters.
Communication with one chopper was lost at 10:38pm off the island of Torishima, and a minute later an emergency signal was received from this aircraft, broadcaster NHK reported. Some 25 minutes later, at around 11:04pm, the military realised that communication with the other aircraft was also lost in the same area.
The Mitsubishi SH-60K helicopters from the MSDF are mainly based on and operate from naval destroyers.
The MSDF said as there were no other aircraft nor vessels in nearby waters, involvement of another country in the incident is unlikely, NHK added.

6,Landslide win for pro-China leader’s party in Maldives vote,"In 93-member parliament, Muizzu’s party wins 66 of the first 86 declared seats.","MALE: The party of Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu won control of parliament in a Sunday election landslide, results showed, with voters backing his tilt towards China and away from regional powerhouse and traditional benefactor India.
Muizzu’s People’s National Congress (PNC) won 66 of the first 86 seats declared, according to the Elections Comm­ission of Maldives results, already more than enough for a super-majority in the 93-member majlis, or parliament.
The vote was seen as a crucial test for Muizzu’s plan to press ahead with closer economic cooperation with China.
The PNC and its allies had only eight seats in the outgoing parliament, with the lack of a majority stymieing Muizzu after his presidential election victory in September.

In 93-member parliament, Muizzu’s party wins 66 of the first 86 declared seats

The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) — which had previously had a super-majority of its own — was headed for a humiliating defeat with just a dozen seats.
Muizzu, 45, had been among the first to vote on Sunday, casting his ballot at a school in the capital Male — where he was previously mayor — and urging Maldivians to turn out in high numbers.
“All citizens should come out and exercise their right to vote as soon as possible,” Muizzu told reporters.
The Maldives — a low-lying nation of some 1,192 tiny coral islands scattered some 800kms across the equator — is one of the countries most vulnerable to sea level rises caused by global warming.
Muizzu, a former construction minister, has promised he will beat back the waves through ambitious land reclamation and building islands higher, a policy which environmentalists argue could even exacerbate flooding risks.
Muizzu won last Septem­ber’s presidential poll as a proxy for pro-China ex-president Abd­ulla Yameen, freed last week after a court set aside his 11-year jail term for corruption.
Indian troops leaving
This month, as campaigning for the parliamentary elections was in full swing, Muizzu awarded high-profile infrastructure contracts to Chinese state-owned companies.
His administration is also in the process of sending home a garrison of 89 Indian troops who operate reconnaissance aircraft gifted by New Delhi to patrol the Maldives’ vast maritime borders.
The outgoing parliament, dominated by the pro-India MDP of Muizzu’s immediate predecessor Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, has sought to disrupt his efforts to realign Maldivian diplomacy.
Since Muizzu came to power, lawmakers blocked three of his nominees to the cabinet and refused some of his spending proposals.
“Geopolitics is very much in the background as parties campaign for votes in Sunday’s election,” a senior Muizzu aide told AFP ahead of the poll, asking not to be named.
“He came to power on a promise to send back Indian troops and he is working on it. The parliament has not been cooperating with him since he came to power.”
Solih was also among those voting early and expressed confidence his party would emerge victorious. There was no immediate reaction from his party to their poor showing in Sunday’s vote.
Election chief Fuad Thaufeeq said after polls closed that turnout had already reached 73 per cent of the 284,663 electorate when half an hour of voting remained.
Muizzu’s prospects received a fillip with the release of his mentor Yameen from house arrest, on Thursday.
A court in the capital Male, ordered a retrial in the graft and money laundering cases that saw Yameen being sent behind bars, after he lost a re-election bid in 2018.
