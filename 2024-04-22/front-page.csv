• Initial, unconfirmed results indicate ruling party leading on nearly all Punjab seats
• Lone Sindh seat goes to PPP; PTI grabs two more seats in KP; PML-N and BNP-M set to bag one seat each in Balochistan
• Polling day marred by multiple incidents of violence across country; one killed in Narowal
ISLAMABAD: The ruling PML-N seemed to be in a commanding position after the close of polling, as by-elections were held in 21 constituencies across the country, initial and unofficial results showed on Sunday.
In Punjab, the election was held on 12 provincial and two national assembly seats, in Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, the election was held on four seats, two seats in Balo­chistan, and one National Assembly seat in Sindh was also up for grabs.
As per a preliminary count, the PML-N appeared to be leading in all constituencies in Punjab, except Rahim Yar Khan.
In Sindh, the PPP candidate was the likely winner whereas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PTI-backed candidates were leading on two seats in D.I. Khan and Kohat, with PTI-backed Faisal Amin Khan Gandapur securing victory in NA-44, as per the unofficial result released by the returning officer in D.I. Khan.
Although parts of Punjab and KP saw across-the-board suspension of mobile and internet services and the army was deployed for security purposes along with police and civil armed forces, the by-polls witnessed multiple incidents of violence, leading to the death of a PML-N supporter in a clash outside a Narowal polling station.
In Sheikhupura, four people were wounded whereas PML-N and PPP supporters clashed in Rahim Yar Khan.
Punjab
The NA seats on which by-elections took place included NA-119 (Lahore) and NA-132 (Kasur), while the Punjab Assembly seats for which the by-polls took place included PP-22 (Chakwal), PP-32 (Gujrat), PP-36 (Wazirabad), PP-54 (Narowal), PP-93 (Bhakkar), PP-139 (Sheikh­upura), PP-147, PP-149, PP-158, and PP-164 (Lahore), PP-266 (Rahim Yar Khan) and PP-290 (Dera Ghazi Khan).
In Punjab, the turnout was low as key leaders stayed away from electioneering. However, the polling exercise was marred by allegations of rigging, with the PTI claiming to be at the receiving end.
A supposed ‘confession’ by a presiding officer at a polling station in Lahore was circulated with the claim that he had obtained the signatures of agents before the end of polling, while a video clip supposedly showing irregularities at a Wazirabad polling station also circulated on Sunday.
The PTI alleged that the presiding officer for polling station-127 in Lahore’s PP-149 had made polling agents sign the Form-45 before the culmination of the polling and the officer was quoted as “admitting” the irregularity arguing that “he had done so to save time”. PTI-SIC candidate Zeshan Rashid staged a sit-in at the polling station to protest this transgression.
In Gujrat, former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi’s wife Sumera Elahi alleged that ballot papers were snatched and stuffed into ballot boxes in favour of PML-Q’s Musa Elahi, a nephew of ex-CM Parvez, at the Kathala polling station while the police ignored this practice. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and opposition leader in the national assembly Omar Ayub Khan along with other party leaders also reached Gujrat to monitor the situation.
The Lahore police also arrested former PTI MPA Shabbir Gujjar from the Valencia Town polling station apparently without any charge.
Likewise, a video clip showed the recovery of dozens of ballot papers purportedly from the presiding officer of a polling station in PP-36 Wazirabad. In Rahim Yar Khan, the PPP workers alleged that PML-N supporters attacked them with batons to push them away from the polling stations where the PPP  candidate was winning.
They claimed that a female polling agent of the PPP was also “kidnapped by the ruling party supporters”. By the filing of this report at 11pm, the ruling PML-N was leading all the electoral contests except in Rahim Yar Khan.
Balochistan
In Balochistan, elections were held on PB-22 (Lasbela) and PB-20 (Wadh), whereas re-polling was held in PB-50 (Qila Abdullah) amid some reports of violence.
According to the unofficial result, PML-N’s Nawab­zada Zareen Magsi won from Lasbela with 49,777 votes while independent candidate Shahn­awaz Hassan got 3,869 votes. In Wadh, Mir Jahanzeb Mengal obtained 30,455 votes while Shafiq Mengal got 14,311 votes.
In Lasbela, Mir Hassan Jamote who was contesting the by-election on the PPP ticket withdrew from the contest in favour of Zareen Magsi on the directive of President Asif Ali Zardari. Nawabzada Zareen Magsi is son of Mir Aamir Magsi, a leader of PPP Sindh and son-in-law of ex-CM Jam Kamal.
In Qila Abdullah, armed men barged into polling stations during the re-polling, prompting a notice from the ECP chief, Sikandar Sultan Raja who asked the police chief to submit a report in this regard. “Strict action should be taken against those who are responsible for entering the polling stations,” he told the Balochistan IGP.
In a press conference, Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) leader Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal claimed that armed men entered polling stations and took hostages.
The Awami National Party leaders shifted the blame and said the PkMAP was behind this incident. However, the polling continued.
The Supreme Court had ordered re-polling in the constituency when the election commission’s decision regarding re-polling in 12 polling stations was challenged. The apex court rejected the decision of the election commission and ordered re-election in the entire constituency.
Engineer Zamrak Khan Piralizai of the ANP and Mirwais Achakzai of the PkMAP were vying for this seat. On February 8, the former was elected to this seat for the fourth time.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
In KP, by-elections were held in NA-8 (Bajaur), NA-44 (D.I. Khan), PK-22 (Bajaur) and PK-91 (Kohat). The situation largely remained peaceful barring minor altercations at some polling stations. Voters and supporters of various candidates complained about sudden changes to some polling stations in Khar and Sadiqabad areas of the Bajaur district.
Workers of different political parties, however, said the turnout was lower than expected, while the participation of women voters was even lower. Polling staff at several polling stations for women told Dawn the number of women voters was “very low”.
In NA-8, the competition acc­o­rding to the unofficial initial results, seemed to be between PTI-backed Gul Zafar Khan and the independent candidate Mubarak Zeb Khan, younger brother of the slain PTI leader Rehan Zeb Khan. Mubarak Zeb Khan was reportedly the winner in PK-22 as well.
The NA-44 seat became vacant when Faisal Amin’s brother and Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sardar Ali Amin Khan Gandapur vacated it.
According to unofficial results of all 358 polling stations issued by the Returning Officer, PTI-backed Faisal Amin Khan Gandapur secured 66,332 votes while his runner up candidate Abdur Rasheed Khan Kundi of PPP bagged 21,972 votes.
The overall voter turn out remained quite low which was 24.40 per cent.
Sindh
In Sindh, PPP’s Khursheed Ahmed Junejo was ahead with 15,932 votes from 65 polling stations according to the unofficial results from NA-196 in Shahdadkot. Mr Junejo bagged 15,932 votes from 65 polling stations out of the total 303 polling stations in Shahdadkot.

1,Two Customs men slain in another attack in Dera Ismail Khan,"A civilian, whose identity was yet to be ascertained, was also killed.","DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least three people, including two Customs officials, were slain in an attack near Bannu Road late on Saturday, according to police.
This was the second attack on Customs officials in Dera Ismail Khan in five days.

2,India to rerun election in 11 Manipur areas amid violence,"The main opposition Congress party has demanded a rerun at 47 Manipur polling stations, alleging that booths were captured and elections were rigged.","NEW DELHI: Amid reports of violence and damage to voting machines in the Manipur state torn by months of ethnic clashes, India will rerun voting at 11 polling stations in the northeastern state on Monday.
The main opposition Congress party had demanded a rerun at 47 Manipur polling stations, alleging that booths were captured and elections were rigged.
However, election autho­rities declared the voting void at the 11 locations and ordered fresh poll, the chief electoral officer of Manipur announced.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is forecast to win a rare third term on the back of issues such as Hindu nationalism.
Clashes among armed groups and attempts to take over polling stations under heavy security were reported on the very first day of voting on Friday in the Manipur state. 
Despite the threat of armed clashes that have killed at least 220 people in the past year, voters turned out in large numbers.
Manipur has been roiled by fighting between the majority Meitei and tribal Kuki-Zo people since May. It remains divided between a valley controlled by Meiteis and Kuki-dominated hills, separated by a stretch of no-man’s land monitored by federal paramilitary forces.

3,"Ministries, divisions ordered to return surplus funds by May 15",IMF negotiations prompt deadline shift to surrender unused funds.,"ISLAMABAD: In the run-up to the finalisation of the federal budget for 2024-25, the Ministry of Finance has asked all ministries, divisions, departments, and self-governing entities to surrender by May 15 the funds that they think cannot be utilised within the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 2024.
Under the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) of 2019, all entities established or operated with public funds are required to surrender their surplus funds each year by May 31 for the closing of fiscal year books. This surrender of funds serves as the basis for the approval and allocation of funds for the subsequent fiscal year.
However, the Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual (APPM) of the federal government requires that such un-utilised funds or those anticipated to remain un-utilised should be surrendered latest by May 15 each year. Therefore, the finance secretary has instructed all counterparts in other ministries to adhere to the APPM for greater clarity.
As a result, the deadline for surrendering unutilised funds has been advanced to May 15, in view of upcoming negotiations with the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) for a 24th bailout programme. The allocations for both development and non-development expenditures for the next fiscal year will be based on actual expenditures in the current year.

IMF negotiations prompt deadline shift to surrender unused funds

In an order, the finance ministry has asked all the principal accounting officers “to ensure that all surrender orders are issued and communicated to” the director of budget computerisation latest by May 15 for entry into the central budget software system, SAP. The order applies to all ministries, divisions, their attached departments and subordinate offices, and autonomous organisations as required under Section 12 of the PFMA.
Under the financial rules and PFMA 2019, an amount included in the original approved budget is required to be given back to the Ministry of Finance as the custodian of the federal finances “because it has not or will not be spent in the financial year by the entity”.
Section 12 of the PFMA 2019 binds that “all ministries, divisions, their atta­ched departments, and sub-ordinate offices and autonomous organisations shall surrender to the Finance Divi­sion [by thirty-first day of May each year], all anticipated savings in the grants or assignment accounts, or grant-in-aid controlled by them”.
In an exceptional case of exigency, the Finance Division has the power to extend the prescribed time limit before the close of the financial year. The Finance Division is also required, under the section to communicate the acceptance of such surrenders before close of the financial year and where requirement is justified, shall provide for equivalent amount in the next financial year’s budget.
Under the APPM, any spending entity required to undertake work or incur expenditure on behalf of another must exercise proper bud­g­etary control over the funds provided by the principal authority.
It is mandatory for the entity incurring the expenditure to ensure that the funds provided by the principal entity are not exceeded, the money is spent for the intended purpose, and any anticipated savings are promptly surrendered back to the principal entity. The principal entity is then required to communicate the grant within which expenditure may be incurred to the concerned spending entity and issue the required approval for expenditure to be incurred by a nominated authority in that entity.
APPM’s Section 3.3.12.6 binds all such entities to surrender all anticipated savings to the government immediately as they are foreseen, but no later than May 15 each year.
“Savings from funds provided after May 15 must be surrendered no later than 30 June,” it reads, instructing the principal accounting officers to exercise stringent controls in the spending of all potential or actual savings.
Under these rules, no savings could “be held in reserve for possible future excesses”, and expenditure postponed could not be reallocated to meet new items of expenditure, or expenditure must not be incurred simply because funds may be available within a particular grant. “Grants that cannot be properly utilised must be surrendered,” it said.
Earlier last year, as required under the PFMA 2019, the government compelled all ministries, divisions, the four provinces, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan to immediately surrender their working capital and surplus funds kept for investment, and deposit the money into the single treasury account of the federation.
Article 78 of the Constitution stipulates that all funds received by or on behalf of the federal government are deposited either as part of the Federal Consolidated Fund (FCF) or the Public Account of the Federation (PAF). The cash balances of both FCF and PAF are mai­ntained under central account No.1 (non-food) at the State Bank of Pakistan, while Article 79 requires the custody and payment of moneys from and to the central account to be regulated by an act of parliament.
The Public Finance Mana­gement Act (PFMA), passed by the parliament in 2019 at the requirement of lending agencies, now governs all matters related to the FCF and PAF. It requires the operations of the FCF and PAF to vest in the finance division under the overall supervision of the federal government.
Furthermore, Section 23(2) of the Act also “requires that no authority shall transfer public moneys for investment or deposit from the government account, including the assignment accounts, to any other bank account without prior approval of the federal government”.
On top of that, Section 45 of the Act provides overriding effect over all other laws, and any law inconsistent with this Act, while Rule 4(4) of Cash Management and Treasury Single Account Rules 2020 stipulate that no authority shall transfer public money in contravention of sub-section (2) of Section 23.

4,Iranian president arrives for three-day visit today,"• FO says visit first by any head of state after Feb 8 polls • Raisi to meet President Zardari, PM Shehbaz, Senate chairman • Will","• FO says visit first by any head of state after Feb 8 polls
• Raisi to meet President Zardari, PM Shehbaz, Senate chairman
• Will also head to Lahore and Karachi to meet provincial leaders
ISLAMABAD: Iranian Presi­dent Ebrahim Raisi is set to arrive in Pakistan today (Monday) for a three-day official visit, the Foreign Office said in a statement on Sunday.
“President of the Islamic Republic of Iran will undertake an official visit to Pakistan from April 22 to 24, 2024,” the official statement said.
This visit, the first by any head of state to Pakistan after the Feb 8 general elections, comes amid escalating tensions in the Iran-Israel conflict.
During his visit, the Iranian president will be accompanied by his spouse and a high-level delegation comprising the foreign minister, other cabinet members, senior officials and a large business delegation.
Mr Raisi will meet President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq. He will also visit Lahore and Karachi and meet with the provincial leadership.
“The two sides will have a wide-ranging agenda to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran ties and enhance cooperation in diverse fields including trade, connectivity, energy, agriculture, and people-to-people contacts,” the Foreign Office said.
“They will also discuss regi­onal and global developments and bilateral cooperation to combat the common threat of terrorism,” it said, adding that the two countries enjoy strong bilateral ties anchored in history, culture and religion. “This visit provides an important opportunity to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations,” it said.
Mr Raisi’s visit to Pakistan had been in doubt as Middle East tensions rose after Iran launched an unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel a week ago in retaliation for an airstrike on the Iranian consular building in Damascus earlier this month. Then, on Friday, central Iran received what was presumed to be an Israeli attack.
Tehran has played down the apparent Israeli attack and indicated it had no plans for retaliation, a response that appeared gauged towards keeping the Gaza war from expan­ding to a regionwide conflict.
Pakistan has called on all parties in the Middle East to “exercise utmost restraint and move towards de-escalation”.
Cross-border strikes
Mr Raisi’s visit is also significant as Pakistan and Iran seek to mend ties after tit-for-tat missile strikes in January. The cross-border strikes stoked regional tensions already inflamed by the Gaza war.
Tehran carried out the strikes against an anti-Iran group in Pakistan the same week it targeted Iraq and Syria. Pakistan responded with a raid on “militant targets” in  Sistan-Balochistan province.
Both countries have accused each other of sheltering militants in the past.
Iran-Pakistan pipeline
Pakistan is also counting on a joint gas project with Iran to solve a long-running power crisis that has sapped its economic growth.
A $7.5 billion Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline intended to feed Pakistani power plants was inaugurated with great fanfare in March 2013. But the project immediately stagnated following international sanctions on Iran.
Tehran has built its own section of the 1,800-kilometre pipeline, which should eventually link its South Pars gas fields to Nawabshah.
In February, the outgoing caretaker government in Pakistan approved the construction of an 80km section of the pipeline, primarily to avoid the payment of billions of dollars in penalties to Iran due to years of delays.
Washington has warned that Pakistan could face US sanctions, saying it does not support the pipeline going forward.

5,Aurangzeb expects PIA privatisation by end of June,"Says bids for flag carrier to come in two to three weeks; Islamabad airport will be next, followed by Karachi, Lahore.","• Says bids for flag carrier to come in two to three weeks
• Islamabad airport will be next, followed by Karachi, Lahore
WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb has stated that the process of privatising PIA will be finalised by the end of June or early July, with Islamabad airport potentially following suit shortly after.
“The government has no business being in business,” the minister declared at a Saturday afternoon news briefing, explaining the government’s plan to divest from state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
“We expect the bids for PIA to come in the next two to three weeks, and by the end of June or early July, we can move it to the investors,” he said. “The Islamabad airport would be the next,” he added, “followed by the airports in Karachi and Lahore.”
Mr Aurangzeb did not respond when asked if Pakistan was also selling its skies to the bidders.
Airlines pay overflight fees to the governments of each country they fly over on their routes. This covers the use of air traffic control and other navigation services.
The minister did not explain if the government would retain some shares in PIA after privatisation or sell all its shares.
Mr Aurangzeb concluded his visit to Washington on Sunday with a busy week of 62 meetings — explaining decisions, making pledges, and seeking understanding with multilateral and bilateral donors.
The finance minister and his team were in Washington this week to attend the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. They also conducted a series of bilateral meetings with visiting finance ministers, heads of financial institutions, and senior US officials.
His meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu drew significant attention in Pakistan, as former prime minister Imran Khan accuses Mr Lu of toppling his government. When asked about this particular meeting, Mr Aurangzeb, however, pointed out that visitors do not determine whom they meet; rather, it is the hosts who decide.
At his news conference at the Pakistan Embassy, Mr Aurangzeb reiterated his position that Pakistan did not need new prescriptions to fix its economy, stating, “We need to implement the plans we make.”
He highlighted three main planks of his economic strategy: expanding the tax net, implementing energy reforms, and privatising the SOEs.
The government, he said, had prepared short, medium, and long-term strategies for expanding the tax net.
“It’s quite clear that there’s a gap between policies and implementation,” remarked Mr Aurangzeb when asked why Pakistan has failed to resolve this long-standing issue.
“For instance, litigation in the tribunals, manned by the FBR and the law ministry, took forever,” he added.
“We have asked them to make decisions in the next three or four months, even if it goes against us,” he said. “We have also shortlisted consultants for end-to-end digitalisation, which would definitely improve tax collection.”
He said the government was also expediting the process for identifying people who lived beyond their means, and they would soon be brought under the tax net.
He stressed that providing energy — petrol, gas, electricity — to both domestic and commercial consumers was necessary for uplifting the economy. “If we cannot get this right, we cannot increase our exports,” he said.
Mr Aurangzeb said the government was already taking steps to stop leakages and theft of electricity and to move distribution into the private sector. “The direction is very clear,” he declared.
