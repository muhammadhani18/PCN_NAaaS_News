2,Call for action to avert monsoon flooding in Pindi,WASA urges proactive measures to shield low-lying areas from inundation,"The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has issued an urgent appeal to the Capital Development Authority (CDA), urging proactive measures to shield low-lying areas in Rawalpindi from inundation during the monsoon season.
The agency has highlighted the pressing need to address the substantial influx of water originating from the mountains of Islamabad, which pours into Nullah Leh, exacerbating flood risks.
In response to this imminent threat, Wasa has proposed the construction of a dam in Islamabad to intercept the flow of water into Nullah Leh, thereby mitigating the risk of inundation. Additionally, Wasa has forwarded a request for Rs150 million to the Punjab government to facilitate the cleaning of Nullah Leh and 15 other sewage drains within the city limits before the onset of the monsoon season.
During the monsoon period, Rawalpindi grapples with floods in low-lying areas and the cantonment due to the swelling water levels in Nullah Leh. Moreover, post-monsoon, the extended open sewage system transforms Nullah Leh into a source of air pollution. The absence of completed projects, such as an expressway for Nullah Leh or mechanisms for diverting sewage away from the city, perpetuates the annual threat posed by Nullah Leh during the monsoon season.
This year is no exception, as Wasa once again confronts the looming spectre of flooding from Nullah Leh in Rawalpindi. To address this challenge, Wasa has requested Rs80 million from the Punjab government for deepening Nullah Leh through desilting and enhancing water flow to mitigate flooding risks. Furthermore, an additional demand of Rs70 million has been made for the cleansing of 15 sewage drains that discharge into Nullah Leh from inner-city areas.
Muhammad Saleem Ashraf, Managing Director of Wasa, emphasises the annual pre-monsoon clean-up of Nullah Leh and the 15 sewerage drains to ensure unimpeded water flow. This proactive measure aims to expedite the passage of water through the sewerage network, ultimately reducing the risk of flooding in the suburbs of Rawalpindi.
Ashraf identifies a significant contributor to the current flood situation in Nullah Leh as the substantial inflow of water from rivers linked to the catchment area of Islamabad's hills, inundating low-lying areas of Rawalpindi.
In light of these challenges, Wasa recommends to the CDA the diversion of water from the mountains and streams of Islamabad to prevent it from entering Rawalpindi, proposing the construction of a dam in Islamabad as a viable solution. Such measures would not only secure an alternative water source for Islamabad but also alleviate water pressure in Rawalpindi's Leh Nullah, safeguarding suburban areas from floods.
Ashraf underscores Wasa’s commitment to promptly commence desilting operations in Nullah Leh and the fifteen sewage drains upon receipt of funds from the Punjab government. Efforts will be concentrated to expedite these initiatives, aiming to fortify low-lying areas of the city and cantonment against monsoon-related flooding.

3,Webinar urges collaborations for EV transition,Experts say Pakistan needs sustainable policy framework for EV transformation,"Experts at a webinar on Pakistan’s Electric Vehicles (EVs) market potential have called for optimised funding and stakeholders’ collaboration for the EV transition in the country.
They said shifting from existing fuel-based automobiles to EVs was elusive without an optimised funding stream and stakeholders’ collaboration at the government and private sector levels.
The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) as part of its webinar series organised an online discussion on “Pakistan’s Electric Vehicle Market: Challenges, Opportunities, and the 2030 Agenda”.
Dr Naveed Arshad, who is an Associate Professor at LUMS, said that battery technology is evolving and requires research and development along with enhanced capital and technical resources, where the latter could be chipped in through academia.
Ahmed Sajeel from Deewan Motors BMW said that the Japanese automobile companies are resisting EVs which is unsustainable in the prevailing milieu as the international automobile industry has decided to shift towards EVs.
Shell’s Midhat Waris said that Shell Global has the largest EV setup having over 1,000 EV charging stations across the world and has piloted its EV rapid chargers in Pakistan. The company’s biggest EV charging station has been launched in China with a capacity of 250 charging points, she added.
Engineer Asim Ayaz of the Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the Ministry of Industries and Production has given licenses to 34 two and three-wheeler manufacturers, whereas, other private partners are also jumping into EV manufacturing. He underscored that the current issue is the lack of financing facilities for customers at the national level as EVs are more expensive due to batteries’ cost than fuel-based vehicles.
Dr Aazir Anwar Khan said that the EVs would have a huge impact on the middle class mostly relying on two or three-wheelers. The country intends to transition from fuel-based vehicles to EVs directly, and since the outlook is positive and transitional the country needs private funding to run these systems, he added.
Abdul Hadi from the auto industry said that his company started converting fuel-based cars over EVs like Suzuki FX, Mehran, and Bolan in 2021, whereas the running cost of the EV is exponentially low.
Dr Khalid Waleed said that linking EVs with national trade and power sector could help resolve the problem, whereas hybrid EVs could be a way forward. The regulatory environment must be accommodating for local assembly and manufacturing infrastructure that needs to be fostered and sustained whereas the latter is the key part, he added.

4,‘Plastic choking capital’s ecosystem’,US diplomat calls for stakeholder-inclusive intervention,"Plastic pollution in the natural ecosystems of Islamabad is a complex issue that demands stakeholder-inclusive interventions.
This was said by US Embassy Islamabad Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) Andrew Schofer Monday while addressing the World Earth Day cleanup activity at the Kinara Park near Rawal Lake, organised by the US Embassy, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) and Friends of Margalla Hills National Park. The US envoy demanded enhanced mass mobilisation and education to take responsibility for protecting natural ecosystems dwindling due to increased anthropogenic activities.
Earth Day recalls mankind's efforts to recognise its responsibility towards environmental conservation and preservation.
It started back in 1970 after the adverse impacts of industrialisation began to degrade land, air, water and soil. The theme for this year is Planet Vs Plastics as the menace of plastic pollution has cast mind-blowing impacts on human health, ecology and marine life at large as 1-2 million tonnes of global plastic produced rests in the oceans leading to death of an estimated 100,000 or more marine mammals, turtles and one million seabirds every year.
Schofer said, ""Your environment is your home and it is necessary to give it back once enjoying all its resources. However, it's important to ensure and pass on awareness to the masses on plastic pollution. The issue of plastics is very complex and needs government, civil society, volunteers, academia and activists response to resolve the crisis,"" he said.
Andrew Schofer thanked the IWMB and the Friends of Margalla Hills National Park for joining the cleanup activity. He termed the cleaning activity an important opportunity for the embassy staff to engage in the cleanup work to stir motivation for beating plastic pollution.
""This is not only the place where we work, it is where we live and it's our home too. All of us enjoyed the hospitality of Pakistani friends and the parks around the capital with unique environmental features,"" he said. He hoped that since it was Earth Day and a cleaning activity was held at the park to create awareness on reducing single-use plastics, and littering to control plastic pollution, more people would join the drive and follow suit the endeavour to protect mother nature. Chief Volunteer, Friends of Margalla Hills National Park, Mussadiq Malik thanked the US Embassy for its support to organise the activity and appreciated the DCM's commitment to the vision of reducing the use of plastics.
He said plastics were becoming a nuisance for not only the environment but also the humans are facing serious health hazards due to microplastics.
Malik said the theme for this year's World Earth Day was very pertinent as plastics have flooded the oceans, freshwater channels, drains and sewers leading to urban flooding, damage to natural habitats and wild animals leading to their tragic death.

5,School fire prompts safety concerns in Rawalpindi,Devastating inferno reduces 70-80% of children’s school bags and furniture to ashes,"A devastating fire ravaged a private school in Rawalpindi’s Khayaban-e-Sir Syed area, causing significant damage to property and raising alarm over safety protocols.
The inferno consumed furniture worth millions of rupees and the school bags of 70-80% of the students.
Officials said that all students and teachers were evacuated swiftly and no one was reported injured in the incident.
The blaze erupted suddenly, engulfing both buildings of the Dar-e-Arqam School in a blaze that was visible from afar, accompanied by thick plumes of smoke. Children, startled by the unfolding chaos, cried out in fear as teachers, staff, and nearby residents sprang into action, swiftly evacuating everyone to safety at a nearby government college. Despite the rapid evacuation, the fire claimed the belongings of dozens of students and reduced the school's infrastructure to ashes.
Residents and shopkeepers joined the rescue efforts, braving the flames to ensure the children were safely ushered out. Parents were promptly contacted and reunited with their children, averting a potential tragedy.
Firefighters from Rescue 1122 battled the flames for an hour before bringing the situation under control. Recounting their ordeal, students described moments of panic and suffocation as thick smoke filled their classrooms during Urdu lessons, forcing a hasty exit through narrow school gates.
One student, Muzamil, credited his father, Jan Zeeshan Khan, for aiding in their escape and praised the swift response of the community in the face of danger. Initial investigations pointed to a short circuit as the cause, possibly exacerbated by previous electrical disruptions.
Authorities, including the police and Rescue 1122 responded to the emergency, launching an inquiry into the incident. As a precaution, the school remains closed pending a thorough safety assessment and electrical inspections.
District Education Authority (DHA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Yasin Baloch has ordered a comprehensive probe into the fire, emphasising stringent safety measures before schools can reopen. Agha Shahab Maqsood, a senior member of the All Pakistan Private Schools Association (APPSA), confirmed the fire's origin on the upper floor due to a short circuit and praised the swift action that prevented injuries but highlighted the urgent need for improved safety standards across educational institutions.
Sources said the fire also reportedly damaged its structure, forcing the authorities to seal the building for proper assessment.

7,Kids drawn to ‘toys of violence’ in Rawalpindi,The trend highlights a worrying fascination that vendors are quick to exploit,"The surge in street crime in the twin cities is beginning to have a detrimental impact on children engaging in outdoor play with modern toy weapons. Even parents say their children save their pocket money to buy these artificial toy weapons.
During the recent religious festival of Eidul Fitr, where children receive generous amounts of money as Eidi, many squandered their money on purchasing modern artificial toy weapons. They kept themselves engaged in games of policemen and robbers during vacations, they wielded these latest toys, mimicking firing actions from behind and around cars.
Shazia Khan, a resident of Islamabad and a parent of four children, shared with The Express Tribune that it's not just typical children, even those with autism are now drawn to playing with toy weapons. ""I was in the kitchen when my 10-year-old autistic nephew approached me, waving his toy gun and demanding money. At first, I chuckled, but then I was taken aback. Such behaviour might be expected from typical children, but not from those with special needs.""
Another woman from Rawalpindi, Qamar Fatima, said that she saw many children firing from artificial guns hiding behind and around the cars.
Observing the children's fascination, vendors have set up stalls selling weapon toys in streets and markets. In the open market, prices for toy weaponry vary: a toy pistol costs Rs50 , a triple-two costs Rs200, a modern Kalashnikov is priced at Rs350, a machine gun at Rs400, and a Mauser at Rs200. Additionally, bullets are sold for Rs50 to Rs100 per dozen. This growing trend of children engaging with toy weapons is deeply concerning.
In many areas, adults were observed purchasing these toy weapons for children under their care, prompting citizens to demand a ban on these latest toys.
A teacher at a government school, Muhammad Idris reminisces about his childhood, when water pistols and toy pistols with small firecrackers were prevalent while now modern weaponry is now available in toy form. The bullets for these toys range from 1 to 3 inches, posing a serious risk of injury, including vision loss, if fired from a distance.
An elderly citizen of Rawalpindi, Haji Fayyaz, was of the view that while small toy pistols may be deemed acceptable, the emergence of toy versions of modern weapons by criminal elements is alarming. This trend risks instilling a fascination with arms in children, fuelling future street crime. Immediate action is warranted to ban modern weapon toys, he added.
