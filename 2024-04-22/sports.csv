0,Illegal shelter homes threaten minors,A large number of private dwellings for orphans are not registered with the Child Protection Bureau,"Whenever the country is hit by an economic crisis, news media starts brimming with reports of children abandoned by parents, inside garbage cans and at shrines, out of which only a lucky few end up in the custody of trusted orphanages or doting adoptive parents, the rest however, are left stranded at the mercy of wild stray dogs and illegal shelter homes.
In Punjab, several shelter homes are working at the government and non-government level for rearing abandoned, destitute and orphaned children yet no government agency has any record of the number of children who are living in these shelter homes or the background of these children since a large number of the sanctuaries are not registered with the Child Protection Bureau despite the legal requirement. As a result, the future of hundreds of children brought up in these shelter homes has become worrisome.
“It is surprising how a shelter home can keep children without any legal authority. Unfortunately, some people have used the work of providing shelter to children as a way to hide their earnings and ill-gotten wealth. It is the responsibility of the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau to register all institutions that provide shelter to children. SOPs should exist for shelter homes which give guidelines on how the children will be provided with accommodation, food, education and skills,” said Rashida Qureshi, a children’s rights activist and Program Coordinator of Search for Justice.
According to Sara Ahmed, Chairperson of the Child Protection Bureau, Clause 20A of the Destitute and Neglected Children Amendment Act of 2017 mandates the accommodation of abandoned, destitute and orphaned children in Punjab.
“It is necessary for the NGOs providing shelter to such children to register themselves with the Child Protection Bureau. We have sent notices to all orphanages and shelter homes working in Punjab for registration,” revealed Ahmed, who further added that so far only one organization has been registered with the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau.
According to a report obtained by the Express Tribune, so far only 30 NGOs or shelter homes out of a total of 52 have submitted their applications for registration to the Child Protection Bureau. Out of these, 27 applications were sent to the respective Deputy Commissioners for a No Objection Certificate but no response has been received yet. Similarly, notices have been sent to 19 NGOs and shelter homes, while the process of issuing licenses to two is pending.
A total of 76 institutions are currently providing shelter to children in Punjab, out of which 15 institutions are managed by the Social Welfare Department, nine institutions are managed by the Child Protection Bureau, while the remaining 52 are non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which are providing accommodation, education and training to children.
It is worth recalling that the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau recently rescued 32 young children from an orphanage called Gharana Yateemkhana located in the Gajumatta area of Lahore. The children, 18 boys and 14 girls, were aged between three to 12 years. The orphanage has been sealed and the head has been arrested.
“We will take similar action against all such illegal shelter homes,” concluded Ahmed.

2,The mirage of impunity sans indiscipline,Police's return to imperial tactics after May 9 becoming a general trend,"With a few weeks remaining before the first anniversary of the May 9 riots, the Punjab Police appears to have pivoted its methods towards the traditional blatant use of force and humiliating tactics to spread terror for creating deterrence against crimes.
In the past two decades, there had been a heated debate between the old and new schools of thought regarding policing in the province. The new school advocated for organizing the department on a public service-oriented model, professionalism and modernization in accordance with contemporary global trends.
The old school wanted to stick to the centuries-old crude policing techniques, while the new school advocated the use of technology in crime prevention, upgrading the infrastructure, improving evidence collection and focusing on detection.
It advocated community policing -- building cooperation with the public in crime fighting.
The old school wished to continue operating Punjab Police on the imperialist model of Irish Military Police and focused on creating deterrence to fight crime. Its adherents defended the practices of torture, illegal detention and staged encounters to create a sense of fear among criminals against committing crime.
It is said the time is the best teacher. The debate was fortunately going on the 21st century, when the world was fast changing. It looked like the advocates of the new approach had won as policies were being implemented in the department. Police rules, regulations and training were revised and the department's work was converted from manual to IT based.
Focus was also evident on improving the public image of the police, working conditions of the personnel and their training.
Before the introduction of news channels and mobile phone cameras at the mass level in the country, especially in the 80s and 90s, it was a common practice of the police to publicly humiliate a criminal by shaving his head, flogging and ransacking his property. It was an acceptable norm in the police rank and file. The officers who committed such brutal acts repeatedly were lauded.
Gradually, the frequency of such incidents decreased, but they did not end.
Then came a time when departmental action was taken whenever sch a case of highhandedness was reported.
The police officers began conceding that such measures should be stopped as they tainted the image of the police among the people.
And then happened the May 9 riots.
Horrific tales of police excesses and brutalities, a reminiscence of colonial times, were reported at scale not heard of in the past two decades.
Initially, the blatant use of police force was directed against the suspects linked to the May 9 riots.
However, the trend gradually became routine.
An example is the recent arrest of High Court Advocate Mian Abdul Mateen after an FIR was registered against him under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 on the charge of sharing the videos of a police station.
Over a dozen policemen from Tibbi City police station raided his office after midnight and dragged him to a police van.
The policemen made him walk barefoot in the police station and recorded his video, which was shared online after adding background music.
Even police officers of the rand of inspector shared visuals of the lawyer handcuffed and barefoot in the police station on their social media accounts with taunting and humiliating poetry, music and quotes.
A day later, an FIR under the Anti-Terrorism Act was registered against a brother of the detained lawyer was also registered. The police raided his office and also detained his associates who had nothing to do with the FIR.
Another case was reported from the Badami Bagh area, where a police constable and his son murdered a local man having criminal record.
A video surfaced in which the deceased criminal could be seen hitting a man in his head with his shoe in a police station while a constable was holding his handcuff. The head of the victim was also shaved.
Another case led to the transfer of Liaqat Malik as DIG of the Organised Crime Unit (OCU) after a man accused officers of the police wing of inhumane treatment and molestation with threats of making videos of his wife viral.
The complainant accused the police in a video of subjecting him to humiliation to stop him from pursuing the return of his Rs14 million rupees that the police had taken hold off.
Pointing out that the inhumane policing practices had become redundant because of their failure would be tantamount to stating the obvious. The need for innovative policies had been felt because of this and reverting to the old tactics would not serve any cause.

3,Govt mulls tough steps against kite flying,Application of anti-terror law under study,"Despite a 19-year ban, kite flying has claimed over 200 lives and left hundreds injured or disabled in Punjab during the period.
The provincial government now contemplates amendments to the Kite Flying Act, possibly incorporating it into the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The ban on kite flying and making in Punjab dates back to 2005 when more than 25 fatalities prompted authorities to take action.
Although the ban was intermittently lifted in 2006 and 2007, escalating fatalities led to a reinstatement in 2007.
In response to Supreme Court directives in 2009, the Kite Flying Act was enacted, empowering police to crack down on offenders. Despite its existence, no kite-flyer or string-maker has faced substantial punishment.
According to sources, 90% of the fatalities have been attributed to chemical strings causing neck or facial injuries.
The implementation of the Kite Flying Act led to a decrease in fatalities from 2009 onwards. However, the annual toll remains an average of 17 to 20 deaths and 50 to 55 injuries, especially during the spring festival of Basant celebrated in Punjab.
Efforts to curb the menace have been met with limited success. Despite numerous arrests and cases filed against kite makers, flyers and string sellers, the practice persists. The highest number of cases and arrests have been recorded in Lahore.
Former provincial law secretary Rauf Sheikh criticised lack of effective enforcement despite existing legislation. He emphasisedthe need for proactive measures, including the suspension of law enforcement officials responsible for string-related deaths and increased public awareness campaigns.
Provincial Information Minister Azma Bukhari acknowledges the longstanding problem and stressed the government's commitment to address it. Stringent amendments to the Kite Flying Act are under consideration, with potential incorporation into the anti-terrorism legislation.
Immediate action includes a crackdown on kite flying, coupled with legal reforms to ensure stringent penalties for offenders.
