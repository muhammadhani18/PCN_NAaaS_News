0,West Indies edge Pakistan in second ODI to clinch series,"The only other notable partnership came for the seventh wicket, as Bismah and Najiha Alvi added 31 runs off 27 balls.","KARACHI: Pakistan captain Nida Dar’s significant milestone of becoming the second bowler from the country to claim 100 One-day International wickets was soured by the West Indies’ two-wicket victory in the second ODI against the hosts here at the National Bank Stadium.
Victory for the visitors meant they gained an unassailable lead over Pakistan in the three-match series after what was a thriller of an encounter that ended on the last ball.
Facing a target of 224 runs, West Indies found themselves at 213-5 in 48 overs. Requiring six runs from the final over, and three off the last ball, a boundary off an outside edge from Karishma Ramharack sealed the dramatic win for the side, shattering Pakistan’s hopes.
Initially cruising at 180-3 in 41 overs, West Indies were sent into a tailspin by Nida’s exceptional bowling performance. Nida, who reached the milestone by dismissing opener Rashada Williams, dismantled the middle order by accounting for Chedean Nation, Aaliyah Alleyne, and Chinelle Henry, leaving West Indies struggling at 219-7 after 49 overs.
Despite a valiant effort by pacer Fatima Sana, who conceded only two runs off the first five balls and claimed the wicket of Afy Fletcher, her disappointment was palpable as the ball found the boundary off Ramharack’s bat.
Nida finished with remarkable figures of 4-52 runs in nine overs, while Umm-e-Hani secured two wickets for 38. Sadia Iqbal and Fatima also chipped in with a wicket each.
Stefanie Taylor was instrumental in West Indies’ victory, crafting a composed 73 off 90 balls with nine boundaries before falling to Sadia. This marked her 41st career half-century in 156 matches.
Taylor, a former top-ranked batter, forged an 88-run partnership for the third wicket with Shemaine Campbelle, who contributed a solid 52 off 73 balls with four fours.
Campbelle had earlier partnered with skipper Hayley Matthews, adding 39 runs for the second wicket before Matthews was caught by substitute Diana Baig after scoring 44 off 63 balls with three fours.
Earlier, Bismah Maroof and Sidra Ameen propelled Pakistan to a total of 223 in 48.5 overs. Bismah scored a patient 65 off 105 balls, her 21st half-century in 135 matches, while Sidra struck a brisk 50 off 70 balls, her eighth half-century in 65 matches, with four boundaries. The duo stitched together an 80-run partnership for the second wicket.
The only other notable partnership came for the seventh wicket, as Bismah and Najiha Alvi added 31 runs off 27 balls. Sadia and Najiha contributed a further 22 runs for the last wicket.
Chinelle Henry led the bowling attack for the West Indies, claiming three wickets for 37 runs, followed by Karishma Ramharack with three for 48, and Afy Fletcher with two for 46 runs.
Scores in brief:
PAKISTAN 223 in 48.5 overs (Bismah Maroof 65, Sidra Ameen 50, Najiha Alvi 25; Chinelle Henry 3-37, Karishma Ramharack 3-48, Afy Fletcher 2-46); WEST INDIES 225-8 in 50 overs (Stafanie Taylor 73, Shemaine Campbelle 52, Hayley Matthews 44, Chinelle Henry 23; Nida Dar 4-52, Umm-e-Hani 2-38).

1,Thunderous Chapman stuns Pakistan as NZ level series,RAWALPINDI: It seemed like Pakistan were dreading a Mark Chapman onslaught even before he got going.,"RAWALPINDI: It seemed like Pakistan were dreading a Mark Chapman onslaught even before he got going.
The southpaw, who had haunted the hosts when he visited with New Zealand last year, gave Pakistan not one, but two chances to get rid of himself, but both were let slip.
Chapman, therefore, would go on to punish Pakistan brutally, helping the BlackCaps chase down a formidable 179-run target with seven wickets and 10 balls to spare and equal the five-match series 1-1 here at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Coming in it number four, Chapman plundered the Pakistan bowlers for 87 off 42 balls, hitting nine fours and four sixes in the process. He knitted an 88-run partnership with Dean Foxcroft, who played a supporting role in the heist.
New Zealand had managed 59 in the powerplay, before openers Tim Siefert and Tim Robinson were castled by Pakistan pacers Naseem Shah and Abbas Afridi.
Pakistan could have made further inroads had Naseem taken an easy catch at short fine-leg off Shadab Khan’s bowling to dismiss Chapman when he was batting at 16.
He survived to take the visitors to 80-1 by the halfway stage along with Foxcroft and started making Pakistan regret the dropped chance with a clean hit through the covers off Abbas in the 11th over before lofting Iftikhar Ahmed’s off-spin over the bowler’s head for his first six.
Chapman was dropped again in the 13th over, this time by Usman Khan — although it was a tough chance — and celebrated his second reprieve, carting leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed over deep fine for another boundary.
The southpaw cleared long-off off Shadab in the next over for his second maximum and took a couple of runs to bring up his half-century in 29 balls.
Chapman stole two consecutive boundaries off Shaheen Shah Afridi before Foxcroft joined the party with a powerful pull for six against the pacer, who gave away 17 runs in the 15th over. 
Chapman was equally hostile towards Naseem, smacking him for two fours and as many sixes as New Zealand added 23 more to the total in the over, also bringing up the 100-run partnership between Chapman and Foxcroft.
When a wicket finally came — with Abbas dismissing Foxcroft for 31 off 29 — New Zealand needed just nine more to win, and Chapman took them over the line with ease.
Earlier, a late onslaught by Shadab and Irfan Khan pulled Pakistan out of trouble following a short middle-order crisis, which started with Mohammad Rizwan walking off the field due to injury.
The pair, which got together with almost seven overs, amassed 62 off just 34 balls, with Shadab hitting two sixes and four fours for his 41 off 20. Irfan, meanwhile, stayed unbeaten 30 off 20 balls, launching a six and three fours throughout the course of his knock. 
An explosive start by Pakistan openers Babar Azam and Saim Ayub boosted the hosts to 54-0 in the powerplay, with Babar bringing up Pakistan’s 50 with a gorgeous hit over long-on off his counterpart Michael Bracewell’s off-break. 
The Pakistan skipper, however, was less of an aggressor than Saim in the first six overs, with the left-hander smashing a six and five fours in the period. But on the first delivery he faced after the powerplay overs was his last, as he became leg-spinner Ish Sodhi and New Zealand’s opening breakthrough.
Babar did not let that break Pakistan’s rhythm, and with the incoming Rizwan, took the side to 84-1 by the halfway stage, only to spoon Bracewell to Jacob Duffy at point to depart for 37 off 29.
Pakistan brought up their 100 by the end of the 12th over, with Rizwan and Usman in the middle. But it went haywire for Pakistan all of a sudden after that, as Rizwan pulled a cramp to get retired hurt and Usman holed Sodhi out to Duffy at long-off two balls later, leaving Pakistan at 105-3.
But once Shadab and Irfan got going, Pakistan regained their lost momentum and more than made up for the time lost. After Irfan punished a Sodhi half-tracker for his first boundary, Shadab launched Duffy’s pace high and long over midwicket to tee off his fireworks. 
Irfan’s first six was a handsome hit over long-on off Bracewell on the next ball before Shadab smacked the spinner straight down the ground for a humungous six and lifted him through the covers for four more. The former Pakistan vice-captain was undone by Duffy eight balls later, but by that point he had done the damage.
Irfan crafted two more boundaries off Zakary Foulkes’ pace in the last over to drive Pakistan to what proved to be an easy target to chase for New Zealand.

2,Haseebullah replaces Azam,RAWALPINDI: The national selection committee has announced wicket-keeper/batter Haseebullah as the replacement ...,"RAWALPINDI: The national selection committee has announced wicket-keeper/batter Haseebullah as the replacement player for Azam Khan, who was sidelined from the Twenty20 International series against New Zealand due to a tear in his right calf muscle, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Sunday.
Haseebullah will join the Pakistan side after ahead of the fourth T20I, which is set to be held in Lahore on Thursday. The 21-year-old played his maiden, and only match for the national side during the T20 tour to New Zealand earlier this year. 
Azam, meanwhile, was advised to undergo a 10-day rest following radiology reports confirming a Grade One tear of his right calf muscle, said the PCB on Saturday. 
“Azam will now depart from the Pakistan men’s cricket team and report to the National Cricket Academy, where he will commence his rehabilitation process under the supervision of the PCB medical panel,” read the board’s statement.
“The discomfort in Azam’s right calf was first noticed during batting practice in the pre-first T20I training session at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.”

3,United beat Coventry on penalties to set up City FA Cup final,LONDON: Manchester United overcame an astonishing collapse to beat Coventry on penalties in an FA Cup classic on...,"LONDON: Manchester United overcame an astonishing collapse to beat Coventry on penalties in an FA Cup classic on Sunday, setting up a second straight FA Cup final against Manchester City.
Erik ten Hag’s men won the shootout at Wembley 4-2, with Rasmus Hojlund scoring the decisive spot kick after the teams were level at 3-3 after extra-time.
The game perfectly encapsulated a chaotic season for Ten Hag’s men, who are well off the pace in the Premier League and had a Champions League campaign to forget.
There was no hint of what was to come when United coasted into a 3-0 lead against their second-tier opponents in the London sunshine, with goals from Scott McTominay, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes.
But they have made a habit of tossing away leads in recent weeks and the match against Coventry proved no different.
Second-half strikes from Ellis Simms and Callum O’Hare gave the 1987 FA Cup winners hope and Haji Wright levelled from the penalty spot in the 95th minute, capping a scarcely credible comeback.
Coventry fans taunted Ten Hag with chants of  “you’re getting sacked in the morning” as belief infused the massed ranks of supporters clad in blue.
Coventry manager Mark Robins famously played a key part in United’s FA Cup final win in 1990, a victory that launched two decades of success under Alex Ferguson.
But his team’s push to reach the Championship play-offs has faded in recent weeks and they travelled to Wembley as underdogs despite United’s stuttering season.
On Saturday, holders City beat Chelsea 1-0 with a late  Bernardo Silva goal to reach the final after an absorbing end-to-end  Wembley semi-final left the exhausted winners still chasing a domestic  double.
Silva sidefooted home in the 84th minute after Chelsea  goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic parried a Kevin De Bruyne shot and that was  enough to edge a hard-fought affair that left Chelsea boss Mauricio  Pochettino waiting for the season to end.
The result offered some  consolation for Guardiola’s weary team, who were eliminated on penalties  in the Champions League quarter-finals by Real Madrid in midweek.
Portuguese  Silva, who missed a penalty in the shootout defeat at home to Real,  said he was:  “Very happy after a very frustrating week for all of us,  for me personally.
“The good thing is in football, if you play at  Manchester City you play every three days, so after two to three days,  you have a chance for a bit of revenge and to put things right.”.

4,Liverpool bounce back to keep title bid alive,The Reds’ hopes of giving Klopp a glorious farewell were dwindling but they climbed back into the title race with much-needed first win in three league games.,"LONDON: Liverpool got back on track after their week from hell as a 3-1 win at Fulham keep their Premier League title bid alive, while Nottingham Forest launched an astonishing rant at the officiating in their 2-0 defeat against Everton on Sunday.
Jurgen Klopp’s side crashed out of the Europa League quarter-finals against Atalanta on Thursday after suffering a damaging Premier League defeat at home to Crystal Palace last weekend.
The Reds’ hopes of giving Klopp a glorious farewell were dwindling but they climbed back into the title race with much-needed first win in three league games.
Liverpool are now in second place, behind leaders Arsenal on goal difference and one point ahead of third placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand on their two title rivals.
Klopp responded to signs of fatigue from his team in recent weeks by dropping Mohamed Salah to the bench among five changes.
And Liverpool took the hint with a more cohesive display by the banks of the River Thames in west London.
Trent Alexander-Arnold put Liverpool ahead in the 32nd minute with a superb free-kick that flashed into the top corner.
Fulham defender Timothy Castagne levelled from close-range after Liverpool failed to clear in first half stoppage-time.
Ryan Gravenberch restored Liverpool’s advantage in the 53rd minute with a swerving blast from the edge of the area for his first Premier League goal.
Diogo Jota wrapped up the points in the 72nd minute, drilling a clinical low finish into the far corner.
Earlier, Everton took a giant stride towards extending their 70-year stay in the English top-flight in a highly controversial victory over Forest.
Idrissa Gueye and Dwight McNeil scored the goals that took the Toffees five points clear of the relegation zone.
Forest remain just one point above the bottom three and were left dismayed at being denied three strong penalty appeals.
The club’s official account on social media platform X called into question the Premier League’s integrity by claiming the VAR official is a fan of relegation rivals Luton Town.
“We warned the PGMOL (referees’ governing body) that the VAR is a Luton fan before the game but they didn’t change him,” Forest said in a statement said. “Our patience has been tested multiple times. NFFC will now consider its options.”
Meanwhile, Aston Villa tightened their grip on Champions League football next season with a 3-1 win over Bournemouth.
Villa shrugged off the exertions of having to go to extra-time and penalties in midweek to book their place in the Europa Conference League semi-finals against Lille.
Unai Emery’s men even had to come from behind after Dominic Solanke opened the scoring from the penalty spot.
Morgan Rogers’ fine finish just before half-time proved to be the turning point.
Moussa Diaby slotted in from Ollie Watkins’ pass to put Villa in front.
Watkins was the provider once more for Leon Bailey to tap in to seal the points 12 minutes from time.
Victory takes Villa six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur.
Elsewhere, David Moyes’ future as West Ham United manager looks more uncertain after they were thrashed 5-2 at Crystal Palace.
Fresh from their shock 1-0 win at Liverpool last weekend, the Eagles scored four times inside the first 31 minutes.
Michael Olise headed in the opener before Eberechi Eze’s spectacular acrobatic effort found the roof of the net.
Emerson Palmieri’s own goal made it 3-0 before Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice for Palace either side of half-time.
Michail Antonio’s strike and a Tyrick Mitchell own goal was scant consolation for West Ham.
In Saturday’s late match, goals from Leandro Trossard and Martin  Odegaard gave Arsenal a gritty 2-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers.
An early effort  from Kai Havertz in the first minute suggested that fans were in for an  exciting game, but the two sides quickly cancelled each other out as  they struggled to create good goal-scoring opportunities.
Trossard  broke the deadlock just before the break after a scrappy first half,  Wolves defender Santiago Bueno steering the ball into his path while  trying to dispossess Gabriel Jesus and the Belgian lashed it into the  net off the right-hand post.
Odegaard then latched onto a pass from Rice in the fifth minute of stoppage time and then  reacted quickest as his pull-back was blocked, slotting the ball home at  the near post from a tight angle to secure the three points.

5,"Muller bags brace, Kane hits 33rd goal as Bayern thump Union",BERLIN: Harry Kane claimed his 33rd league goal of the season and Thomas Muller scored twice as Bayern Munich...,"BERLIN: Harry Kane claimed his 33rd league goal of the season and Thomas Muller scored twice as Bayern Munich thrashed Union Berlin 5-1 away in the Bundesliga on Saturday.
Just a week after Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen broke Bayern’s 11-year title run, the visitors were dominant and clinical in the German capital.
Kane curled in an excellent free-kick and laid on a second-half goal for Mathys Tel. The England captain is eight shy of Robert Lewandowski’s single-season Bundesliga goals record with four games remaining.
Bayern rested Jamal Musiala after Wednesday’s 1-0 win over Arsenal sent them through to the Champions League semi-finals but they had no difficulty creating chances against Union.
“We’re happy — it was a perfect week. It was by no means guaranteed that we’d win like that,” said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel.
Handed a rare start, French teenager Tel set up Leon Goretzka’s 29th-minute opener, with Kane doubling the lead in first-half stoppage time.
Muellr, playing his 470th Bundesliga game for Bayern, scored both of his goals in the second half, either side of a strike from Tel.Union, who faced Real Madrid and Napoli in the Champions League this season, pulled one back late through Yorbe Vertessen, have now won just one of their past eight and sit three points clear of the relegation places.
Earlier, RB Leipzig tightened their grip on fourth place, the final guaranteed Champions League spot, with a 2-1 win at Heidenheim as Lois Openda scored his 23rd goal of the season.
Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko opened the scoring shortly before half-time, pouncing on some disorganised defending from the home side for his 10th league goal this term.
Heidenheim struck back with 20 minutes remaining, Nikola Dovedan heading in following a free-kick.
Leipzig grabbed the winner with five minutes remaining when Openda tapped in a Mohamed Simakan pass.Meanwhile, a hat-trick from Borussia Moenchengladbach’s Robin Hack was not enough as his side lost 4-3 at Hoffenheim.
Hoffenheim led 3-1 midway through the second half before Hack scored twice in 11 minutes to level the score with just a minute remaining, but Anton Stach scored in stoppage time for the home side to snatch victory.
Elsewhere, bottom side Darmstadt won their first league match since October, beating second-last Cologne 2-0 thanks to goals from Oscar Vilhelmsson and Cristoph Klarer.
Despite the win, Darmstadt remain 10 points from safety with four games remaining.
Cologne’s chances of beating the drop are falling fast. They are five points away from 15th-placed Bochum, the final safe spot.
Bochum lost 1-0 at VfL Wolfsburg, with Ralph Hasenhuettl’s side winning thanks to a goal from Jonas Wind.
Wind’s goal deepened Bochum’s woes a week after sacking coach Thomas Letsch, with the side just one point clear of the relegation spots.

Empoli, who are battling relegation, opened the scoring after four minutes when striker Alberto Cerri headed in a close-range cross for what proved to be the winner.
Serie A is set to secure at least five spots in an expanded Champions League competition next season but Napoli have taken only five points from their last five league matches.
Roma and Atalanta both made the semi-finals of the Europa League on  Thursday while Fiorentina are in the last four of the Europa Conference  League.
That means that Italy has a coefficient of 19.428 points,  ahead of Germany (17.928 points) and England (17.375) and will take one  of two extra spots in the tournament.
Napoli stay on 49 points, three points off Lazio in sixth, six points behind AS Roma, in fifth with two games in hand, and 10 adrift of fourth-placed Bologna, who visit Roma on Monday.
Empoli are 15th with 31 points, four points clear of the drop zone.
“Clearly, Napoli had notorious problems this season. I honestly did not expect to find the situation like this,” the Naples club’s coach Francesco Calzona told DAZN. “Playing every three days, we managed to hide some of the issues, but this team has got to do more, we owe it to the city, to the club that pays our wages.”

STUTTGART: Elena Rybakina ended defending champion Iga Swiatek’s 10-match winning streak in Stuttgart on Saturday to reach the final of the clay-court tournament.
Fourth seed Rybakina came through their semi-final clash 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, stunning the Polish world number one who had captured the last two titles at the German event.
Rybakina will face Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk, who defeated Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 in Saturday’s second semi-final, for the title.
Rybakina now boasts a 4-2 career head-to-head record against four-time Grand Slam winner Swiatek and will be playing in her fifth final of 2024.
“Like always it was a very tough match,” Rybakina said of her opponent. “My serve helped me a lot in important moments. I was fighting for the ball.
“It was such a close match. I’m really happy I managed to win and could show a good game.”Kostyuk took just one hour 35 minutes to beat world number eight Vondrousova, just a day after coming through a three-set epic against US Open champion and world number three Coco Gauff.
“I don’t think a lot of people know but I started my career 0-14 against top 10 players so I’m really trying to catch up,” said world number 27 Kostyuk who also eliminated seventh-ranked Zheng Qinwen earlier in the week.
“These are some of the best players in the world in the last year and it’s incredible to beat all of them — and I’m hoping for a Grand Slam too for myself one day.”
The 21-year-old Ukrainian will play in her second final of the season, having finished runner-up to Katie Boulter at the San Diego Open in March.
It will be her third career final having claimed her maiden WTA title in Austin last season.

LONDON: Reigning Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir crushed the women’s-only world record in winning the 44th London Marathon on Sunday, while Kenyan compatriot Alexander Mutiso Munyao pulled away from Ethiopian distance great Kenenisa Bekele to win the men’s race.
The 30-year-old Jepchirchir crossed the finish line in front of Buckingham Palace in two hours 16 minutes 16 seconds to break Mary Keitany’s mark of 2:17:01 set in a women-only race at the 2017 London event.
Jepchirchir pulled away from a group of four in a sprint finish before collapsing to her knees in tears having beaten the fastest field of women ever assembled.
“I thought the race would be fast and that the record would go, but I was not expecting it to be me,” Jepchirchir said. “It’s because I believe in myself. As I crossed the finish line, I thought about how grateful I am for this to be my last event representing Kenya before I head to Paris (Olympics).”
Munyao, 27, who was pushed by Bekele until the final couple of kilometres, won the men’s race in 2:04.01, pumping his fist several times en route to the biggest victory of his career.
The 41-year-old Bekele — who has raced to three Olympic titles on the track and a remarkable 17 world titles in outdoor and indoor track and cross-country — was second in 2:04.15.
Emile Cairess took third in 2:06.46, all but clinching his spot on Britain’s Olympic team.
Thirty seconds of applause marked the start of the men’s race in memory of world record-holder and last year’s winner Kelvin Kiptum, who died in  a car accident  in February, at the age of 24.
Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia, who clocked 2:11.53 at the Berlin Marathon in September to set a world record for women in a race alongside male runners, crossed second in the women’s race in 2:16.23.
Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya, the 2021 London winner, was third in 2:16.24.

10,Verstappen ‘on another planet’ with victory in China,SHANGHAI: Triple world champion Max Verstappen won Formula One’s first Chinese Grand Prix in five years on Sunday...,"SHANGHAI: Triple world champion Max Verstappen won Formula One’s first Chinese Grand Prix in five years on Sunday with McLaren’s Lando Norris finishing a surprise second to deny dominant Red Bull the one-two.
The crushing victory from pole position at a Shanghai circuit that last hosted a grand prix in 2019 was Verstappen’s fourth in five races in 2024 and came after he also won the season’s first Saturday sprint.
Mexican team-mate Sergio Perez, Verstappen’s closest championship rival but now 25 points behind, completed the podium after a dry race with two safety car periods that compromised his race.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz finished fourth and fifth, respectively, with Mercedes’ George Russell sixth and Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso seventh with a bonus point for fastest lap.
The victory was the 58th of Verstappen’s career and Shanghai became the 26th track he has won at.
“It felt amazing. All weekend I think we were incredibly quick. It was just enjoyable to drive,” said the 26-year-old who took the chequered flag 13.773 seconds clear of Norris. “The car was basically on rails and I could do whatever I wanted to with it.”
Team boss Christian Horner summed up the situation by describing Verstappen, who has won all the races he has finished this year, as a man driving  “on another planet”.
Red Bull are now 44 points clear of Ferrari in the constructors’ standings.
Norris ensured China was the season’s first race without one team finishing first and second — Ferrari having taken the one-two in Australia and Red Bull the rest — with his 15th career podium and eighth second place.
“I just wasn’t expecting today at all,” said the Briton, who started fourth on the grid and was voted Driver of the Day. “I got everything ready to go home early and not be on the podium, so it’s a pleasant surprise.”
His only wrong moves came after the finish when Norris returned to the pit lane rather than parking up alongside Verstappen and Perez on the straight, and later when he picked up the cap for third-placed driver.
China’s first and only driver Zhou Guanyu, in his first home race, had the honour of parking behind the Red Bulls and crouched in tears before saluting the crowd. The Sauber driver finished 14th.
McLaren’s Oscar Piastri finished eighth, with Mercedes’s seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton going from 18th on the grid to ninth and Nico Hulkenberg taking the final point for Haas.
The safety car was deployed twice in the 56-lap race, first on lap 23 when Sauber’s Valtteri Bottas parked up with a failed engine and marshals struggled to shift the car which was stuck in gear.
Second at the lap 27 re-start when there was mayhem with Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll ploughing into the back of Daniel Ricciardo’s RB, the Australian in turn shunted into compatriot Oscar Piastri’s McLaren.
Haas’s Kevin Magnussen and RB’s Yuki Tsunoda also tangled, with the Japanese retiring and the Dane limping back to the pits with a damaged and sparking car.
Stroll and Magnussen were both given 10-second penalties for causing a collision while Williams’s Logan Sargeant collected the same sanction for a safety car infringement. Ricciardo retired in the pits on lap 34.

They took lead through Eric Garcia in the ninth minute and Ivan Martin doubled the lead in the 22nd.
La Liga top scorer Artem Dovbyk increased the advantage in the 71st minute with his 18th league goal of the season before substitute Portu sealed the rout in the 82nd minute.
Gonzalo Escalante had pulled a goal back in the for Cadiz, who remain 18th with 25 points, six points below Celta Vigo.
Girona visit Las Palmas next Saturday in the hunt for the first of the nine points they need to guarantee a spot in the Champions League.
“(I’m) very happy with the win and reaching our first objective, which we’ve done, but we’re not stopping here,” said Martin. “This is a historic day for the club and we have to celebrate it as it deserves.”
Earlier on Saturday, Iago Aspas struck twice for Celta as they romped to a 4-1 win over Las Palmas and boosted their hopes of survival. The Galicians, 17th, moved six points clear of the drop zone.
Elsewhere, Ayoze Perez’s brace helped Real Betis earn a 2-1 win over Valencia, enabling them to leapfrog their opponents to move seventh.
Rayo Vallecano, 14th, climbed away from danger with a 2-1 win over Osasuna.

12,Ruud defeats Tsitsipas to win ‘biggest title’ in Barcelona,"BARCELONA: World number six Casper Ruud defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-3 to win the Barcelona Open on Sunday, ...","BARCELONA: World number six Casper Ruud defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-3 to win the Barcelona Open on Sunday, the biggest title of his career.
The Norwegian earned revenge after his defeat by the Greek world number seven in the Monte Carlo Masters final last weekend.
Ruud, a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, had won 10 titles at 250 level with the 500-ranked clay-court event in Barcelona his 11th career triumph.
“For me it means a lot, this is my biggest title that I ever won in my career, it’s something I’ve chased for a long time already,” Ruud told Teledeporte.
“I’ve never won a 500 before or a 1000, I’ve been to a few finals but always came up a little bit short.
“I didn’t start great during the match but luckily I was able to come back in and play really well in the end of the first and the second set.”
The 25-year-old leads the tour with 29 wins this year but had lost in three finals before wrapping up his first title of 2024 when Tsitsipas, who lacked his usual spark, went long.
“The last six, seven months I’ve taken a few steps in the right direction in my game and I’m glad it’s paying off,” added Ruud.
Ruud conceded a break in the opening game, which Tsitsipas consolidated for 2-0, giving the chance of a repeat of his first-set collapse in the Monte Carlo final.
However Ruud stayed calm and broke back in the sixth game with a passing shot the Greek could not control.
The Norwegian brought up two set points at 6-5 up, clinching it with a break when Tsitsipas erred at the net.
Two-time Grand Slam runner-up Tsitsipas slapped a forehand into the net to concede the first break of the second set and Ruud then held to open up a 4-1 lead.
Tsitsipas saved two break points in the sixth game to give himself a chance of a comeback, but could not match Ruud’s energy after two draining three-set matches in his run to the final.
Ruud’s 91-minute victory ended a 10-match winning streak for Tsitsipas.
“I wasn’t playing my best tennis this week in Barcelona... throughout the whole week I didn’t feel like my shots had the same effect as they did in Monte Carlo,” said Tsitsipas.
“Today it felt like I didn’t have the mental capacity to even fight. Even if I wanted to push myself to fight, Casper was just too good today.”
Tsitsipas blamed the Catalan clay for taking the edge off his shots but said the courts at the Madrid Open where he will compete next week are a better fit for his game.
“The environment in Madrid has shown in the past that it suits me and it’s a place I can play well if I’m in the right mindset and committed to the game,” he added.
