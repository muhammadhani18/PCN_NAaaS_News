0,Baby in Gaza saved from womb of mother killed in Israeli strike,"Overnight strikes killed mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who had been 30 weeks pregnant","A baby girl was delivered from the womb of a Palestinian killed along with her husband and daughter by an Israeli attack in the Gaza city of Rafah, where 19 people died overnight in intensified strikes, Palestinian health officials said.
The dead, killed in hits on two houses, included 13 children from one family, they said.
The baby, weighing 1.4 kg (3.09 lb)and delivered in an emergency C-section, was stable and improving gradually, said Mohammed Salama, a doctor caring for her.
Her mother, Sabreen Al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant.
The baby was placed in an incubator in a Rafah hospital alongside another infant, with the words ""The baby of the martyr Sabreen Al-Sakani"" written on tape across her chest.
Sakani's young daughter Malak, who was killed in the strike, had wanted to name her new sister Rouh, meaning spirit in Arabic, said her uncle Rami Al-Sheikh. ""The little girl Malak was happy that her sister was coming to the world,"" he said.
The baby would stay in hospital for three to four weeks, said Salama, the doctor. ""After that, we will see about her leaving, and where this child will go, to the family, to the aunt or uncle or grandparents. Here is the biggest tragedy. Even if this child survives, she was born an orphan,"" he said.
The 13 children were killed in a strike on the second home, belonging to the Abdel Aal family, according to Palestinian health officials. Two women were also killed in that strike.
Asked about the casualties in Rafah, an Israeli military spokesperson said various militant targets were struck in Gaza including military compounds, launch posts and armed people.
""Did you see one man in all of those killed?"" said Saqr Abdel Aal, a Palestinian man whose family were among the dead, grieving over the body of a child in a white shroud.
""All are women and children,"" he said. ""My entire identity has been wiped out, with my wife, children and everyone.""
Mohammad al-Behairi said his daughter and grandchild were still under the rubble. ""It's a feeling of sadness, depression, we have nothing left in this life to cry for, what feeling shall we have? When you lose your children, when you lose the closest of your loved ones, how will your feeling be?"" he said.
'We are trapped'
Over half of Gaza's 2.3 million people have crowded into Rafah, seeking shelter from the Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of Gaza over the last six months.
Israel is threatening a ground offensive into the area, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said fighters from the freedom fighter group Hamas must be eliminated to ensure Israel's victory in the war.
President Joe Biden has urged Israel not to launch a large-scale offensive in Rafah to avoid more Palestinian civilian casualties.
Palestinian health authorities say more than 34,000 people have been killed in Israel's assault, which began after Hamas fighters attacked Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 253, according to Israeli tallies.
The Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday that Israeli military strikes killed 48 Palestinians and wounded 79 others across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours.
The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said teams recovered 60 bodies from the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the southern of the enclave, weeks after Israeli army forces retreated from the medical complex. That raised to 210 the number of bodies it had dug out from the hospital yards since April 12.
The service said in a statement there were still around 2,000 missing persons under the rubble in Khan Younis and 1,000 in the central areas of the Gaza Strip, whose bodies could not be extracted because of a lack of heavy equipment and machinery for rubble removal.
The Israeli military had no immediate comment.
In the larger of the two Palestinian territories, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Israel said its soldiers opened fire at three Palestinians who attacked them and the Palestinian health ministry said all three had died.
Violence has flared in the West Bank in recent days.

1,"PSX sees record-breaking surge, soars above 71,000 points",Benchmark KSE-100 index sees 1.33% rise,"The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued a record-breaking spree on Monday as it crossed 71,000 points for the first time in history and surged close to the 72,000 mark.
The PSX benchmark KSE-100 Index surged by 1.33% or 940 points and hit an unprecedented all-time high of 71,850 points at 1:38 pm today.
As the trading day progressed, the index maintained its momentum, hovering around 71,772 points, marking an impressive intra-day gain of 1.22% or 862 points.
The increase in activity reflected investors' confidence in the domestic economy, particularly following the government's formal approach to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new loan programme.
Despite the relentless climb of the benchmark index since December 2023, stocks have managed to maintain an affordable stance.
Chief Operating Officer (CEO) of Topline Securities Muhammad Sohail emphasized the sustained positive sentiments pervading the local bourse.
Sohail highlighted the noteworthy milestone of the KSE-100 Index surpassing the 71,000-point mark, attributing the momentum to multiple factors including the government's IMF loan request and robust dividends in the first quarter.
Despite the market's upward trajectory, the forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio (PE) remained at 4, indicating favourable conditions for investors.
Read Saudi visit, IMF talks take PSX to new record
The anticipated IMF loan programme, expected to range between $6-8 billion over three years, is anticipated to facilitate timely repayment of maturing foreign debt and fostering economic rejuvenation in the country.
Amid the remarkable rally, stocks from various sectors, notably banks, technology, petroleum refineries, and airlines, took the lead. Banks held sway over the market, while technology firms played an increasingly significant role in bolstering the country's exports.
Currently, several petroleum refineries listed on the bourse are on the brink of sealing contracts with the government to upgrade their facilities. The objective is to enhance the production of premium products like petrol and diesel while minimizing the output of outdated furnace oil.
Moreover, investor interest in the national flag carrier has surged following shareholder approval for the company's restructuring and privatization. Foreign investors are also actively participating in this surge, injecting fresh investments.
This record-making performance at the national stock market coincides with the official visit of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to Pakistan, further solidifying friendly ties between the two nations and potentially reshaping the political dynamics in the region amidst ongoing Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions.
Last week, on April 19, PSX snapped a three-day losing streak and notched up significant gains as the KSE-100 index reached a historic high above 70,900 with a surge of 620 points, the State Bank of Pakistan attributed the surge's major trigger to the anticipated deal with Saudi Arabia for a minority stake in Pakistan’s Reko Diq copper and gold mining project.
Earlier the same week, the national flag carrier was able to further new records in an earnings season rally backed by gains in oil and banking stocks on April 19, despite volatile trading and concerns over escalating geopolitical tensions.

2,"Floods swamp southern China, spark extreme weather fears",Rescuers raced to flood-hit Guangdong province to evacuate trapped residents,"Floods swamped a handful of cities in southern China's densely populated Pearl River Delta following record-breaking rains, sparking worries about the region's defences against bigger deluges induced by extreme weather events.
On Monday, rescuers on boats in China's flood-hit Guangdong province raced to evacuate trapped residents, carrying some elderly people by piggyback from their homes and deploying helicopters to save villagers caught in landslides.
The province once dubbed the ""factory floor of the world"" is prone to summer floods. Its defences against disruptive floods were severely tested in June 2022 when Guangdong was pounded by the heaviest downpours in six decades. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated.
Since Thursday, Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained and widespread rainfall, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the province's annual flooding season in May and June.
In Qingyuan, a relatively small city of about 4 million north of the provincial capital Guangzhou, residents said the flooding over the weekend was not as severe as the 2022 floods, but they were still concerned.
""We're worried the floods could be worse than two years ago,"" said Song Xiaowei, who works at a spare parts factory.
""I've friends in Jintan town who have already removed their furniture. The village opposite that has been submerged to the first floor.""
Song said his factory was still operating as usual, but rivers were being monitored in case they spilt over onto roads.
One river in the area rose as much as 7 metres (23 feet), submerging nearby farmland, he said.
Over the weekend, the Bei River, a tributary of the Pearl River running through Qingyuan, overflowed its banks and submerged some houses and shops.
Rescuers tackled muddy waters, neck-high in some areas, to extract residents including an elderly lady trapped in waist-deep water in an apartment building, videos on social media showed.
Before 2022, it rarely rained as heavily as it does now, and the flood waters were never as high, said Qingyuan resident Lin Xiuzheng, who worked in online retail sales.
Weather events in China have become more intense and unpredictable because of global warming, scientists say, with record-breaking rainfall and drought assailing the world's second-largest economy, often at the same time.
Precipitation records for April have already been broken in many parts of Guangdong, with the cities of Shaoguan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen to the west and north of Guangzhou also half-submerged in flood-waters.
No fatalities in Guangdong were reported, although 11 people in the province were still missing by Monday morning, state-owned Xinhua News Agency reported without giving further details.
Economic loss
Across the province, 36 houses collapsed while 48 were severely damaged, resulting in a direct economic loss of nearly 140.6 million yuan ($19.4 million), Xinhua reported.
Two companies in the province told Reuters there had been no immediate impact on business or supply chains.
""Everything's running as usual and everyone got to work,"" said a person who answered the phone at Camelot PCB, a print circuit board company that supplies Tesla and other electric vehicle makers.
Polyrocks Chemical, a plastics company that supplies technology giants such as Apple, Huawei and Samsung, also said its operations were not affected.
But many rivers remained swollen on Monday at levels above safety thresholds, with rainfall in recent days two to three times more than what is normally seen at this time of the year.
In Shaoguan, landslides trapped villagers who had to be rescued by helicopter while other rescuers travelled on foot to reach cut-off disaster sites.
The Chinese military also stepped in to help clear roads.
The rains eased early on Monday, but some schools in the province were suspended.
The strong convective weather in southern China was caused by a stronger-than-normal subtropical high, a semi-permanent high-pressure system circulating north of the equator.
The stronger subtropical high led to warmer temperatures that drew in more moisture-laden air from the South China Sea and even the Bay of Bengal, Chinese meteorologists said, resulting in intense precipitation.
Thunderstorms are expected to return later in the week after a brief respite.

8,FinMin vows to continue anti-smuggling operations,Aurangzeb condemns killing of Customs officials in DI Khan,"Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Sunday Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Pakistan Customs were undeterred by the killing to two officials in Dera Ismail Khan and would continue their anti-smuggling operations for the elimination of this menace from the country.
According to a statement issued by the finance ministry, the minister, who is currently in Washington for talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a fresh package for Pakistan, strongly condemned the firing incident of on Customs Officials, while performing anti-smuggling duties.
He expressed deep grief and sorrow over the martyrdom of two officials of the Customs Department. He said that the sacrifices of these martyrs would not go in vain and expressed resolve that the smugglers will be dealt with iron hands.

9,Sustainable Infrastructure Investment urged,Pak UN ambassador calls for connectivity for development,"Pakistan has called for the development of infrastructure connectivity to fortify global resilience and promote sustainable development, especially in developing countries.
Ambassador Munir Akram made the call in his capacity as co-chair of the Group of Friends of Sustainable Infrastructure Investment while delivering a statement during the UN, General Assembly’s Sustainability Week in New York, on the theme: “Informal dialogue on building global resilience and promoting sustainable development through infrastructure connectivity.”
“The achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and our climate goals requires a major transition to sustainable infrastructure – in energy, transport, housing, communications and industrial and agricultural production and consumption,” the Pakistani envoy said, noting that this was recognized in the ‘Just Energy Transition’ document adopted at COP-28.
“Yet,” he said, “public and private investments in sustainable infrastructure are not commensurate to realize either the SDGs or the climate goals, pointing out that a majority of developing countries do not have the public resources to finance infrastructure investments nor are they able to secure sufficient private investment.
To achieve a ‘just transition’, he called for mobilizing significantly larger concessional finance to mitigate country and project risks, enhance credit quality, improve financing terms and thus incentivize private infrastructure investment in the developing countries.
In this regard, Ambassador Akram cited the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which said there was a funding gap of $2.5 trillion annually in infrastructure, two-thirds of which is in developing countries.
“Cumulatively, for a 1. 5°C Scenario, financing needs for clean energy are estimated to be about USD 4.3 trillion per year up until 2030, increasing thereafter to USD 5 trillion per year up until 2050,” he said, pointing out that investment in renewable energy only reached USD 0.5 trillion in 2022, the majority concentrated in developed countries.
The Pakistani envoy also underscored the need to create a pipeline of viable and bankable projects in developing countries which can attract public and private investments.
Pakistan, he said, advocates the establishment of a public-private entity under UN auspices to help developing countries formulate and structure such a pipeline of viable infrastructure projects utilizing the UN country offices.
“Such a public-private entity could bring together all stakeholders – recipient and donor countries, development institutions and the private sector; develop a template for national and international regulatory frameworks and develop de-risking measures to incentivize private investment in developing countries and present the projects for financing to the appropriate public and private sources of investment capital.”
