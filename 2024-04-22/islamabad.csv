0,Comsats University Islamabad rector accused of changing rules to accommodate blue-eyed employees,Faculty members say rector was appointed on temporary basis and supposed to run day-to-day affairs only.,"• Faculty members say rector was appointed on temporary basis and supposed to run day-to-day affairs only
• University official says changes to statute were made by senate, not by rector
ISLAMABAD: Comsats University Islamabad (CUI), which has been functioning under an interim arrangement, is embroiled in an alleged controversy as a clause of its statute was recently changed by the university syndicate headed by the rector who is working on a look-after basis.
In July last year, following the acceptance of the resignation of rector Dr Mohammad T. Afzal, chancellor of the university, the then president Dr Arif Alvi, gave the look-after charge to senior Dean Prof Dr Sajid Qamar till the appointment of a regular rector.
Moreover, offices of the registrar, treasurer and controller are also being run under the interim arrangement while the position of pro-rector was never filled.
Meanwhile, a group of faculty members have leveled allegations of favoritism against the rector.
Talking to Dawn, they claimed that the look-after rector had been making blatant violations of rules and ignoring merit.
Requesting not to be named, they said Dr Sajid Qamar in order to accommodate his blue-eyed faculty members last month made changes to the statute regarding appointment of heads of departments.
As per the existing rules, a head of department (HOD) is appointed from amongst three senior professors and as many associate professors. The faculty members said the syndicate last month changed the rule and increased the number to 10 senior most professors out of whom one would be picked as the HOD.
In other universities, the senior most faculty member is appointed as the HOD. At CUI, the clause was already questionable under which the HOD would be appointed from amongst three professors and three associate professors.
“This has been done to accommodate the rector’s chosen ones,” they alleged.
The group said Prof Qamar was supposed to deal with day-to-day affairs only, alleging that making an amendment to the rules was beyond his mandate.
To support their claim, the faculty members cited Establishment Division’s letter dated April 9, 2021, regarding look-after charge. They added that the university senate was the competent authority to give financial and administrative powers to anyone and in case of a look-after rector, he was appointed by the chancellor.
The faculty members also alleged that Prof Waqas Masood was appointed the head of the Physics Department on June 18, 2021 for a period of three years, but was replaced by a junior professor in violation of rules by the rector last year.
They said when the matter reached Islamabad High Court, the rector had to reverse the appointment. But instead of appointing a senior professor, he picked an associate professor in February this year as the new head (though as per rules the appointment of an associate professor as the HOD is legitimate).
The faculty members also alleged that CUI in violation of rules allowed the transfer of a student of the Department of Computer Science at the Wah campus to the same department at the Islamabad campus. They also alleged that there had been two harassment cases against a faculty member, who was close to the look-after rector. The cases were supposed to be decided by the university’s harassment committee which was formed in 2023 for a two-year term, but all of a sudden the convener and a member of the committee were removed last month.
They alleged that the rector had been using a PhD student to teach courses originally assigned to him (rector) in bachelor’s course of Physics. “Students filed a complaint against this violation of their rights with the HOD on Jan 13, 2024. Despite several reminders, their complaint has not been taken up,” they added.
Comsat Institute became Comsats University in 2018 under an Act which has not yet been fully implemented.
Registrar Prof Dr Sajjad A. Madani is running the office for the last over five years on a temporary basis whereas treasurer Mohammad Azam was appointed in 2018 for three years when Comsats was an institute, but he is still dealing with finances of the university.
Official version of Comsats
General Manager of Rector Secretariat Naveed Ahmed Khan rejected all allegations of the group and said the incumbent rector took all decisions in accordance with rules and regulations and had full authority to run the affairs of the university like previous interim rector.
“He [rector] has authority to chair meeting of syndicate and take decisions in interest of the university,” he said and added that the syndicate, not the rector, approved changes to the statute related to appointment of HODs subject to approval of the university senate.
He said shifting of a student from Wah to Islamabad was legal and a routine matter.
To a query, he said in the past a selection committee had recommended approval to the appointment of the current registrar for three-year term, but the senate did not approve the same because of an issue, which was later settled down.
Meanwhile, the registrar completed the three years and now his case will be referred to the senate to decide whether he should continue or fresh advertisement should be floated, he said.
He said a regular rector would be hired soon as a search committee was going to start interviews from Monday.
“The treasurer was appointed in 2017 when it was Comsats Institute and the treasurer’s position was in grade OG-IV and the Act says no person will be lowered in rank after passing of the Act from parliament.” He added that the convener and a member of the harassment committee were changed because of a delay on their part in finalising inquiries.

7,Pak-EPA calls public hearing  on grid station construction,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) has called for a public hearing in the coming week,...","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) has called for a public hearing in the coming week, inviting possible public concerns on degradation of the environment from the planned construction of a 132KV grid station and its feeding transmission line at the Cabinet Division Housing Society.
The public hearing, which is scheduled to be held on April 25, would allow residents to share their concerns about the physical, ecological, socio-economic and cultural environment of the construction of the grid station and deliberate on mitigation measures to minimise environmental degradation.
Pak-EPA said it would be concerned with soil-related issues such as land clearing, soil contamination from fuel, oil or chemical spillage and leakage, inappropriate waste disposal, and excavation, filling and construction activities.
The environment protection agency said the noise and vibration would be generated by construction machinery and vehicles, besides contamination of groundwater from waste and sewage disposal, maintenance of equipment and machinery and campsite sanitation facilities.
The watchdog was more concerned with the loss of green cover — indigenous vegetation — and the clearing of undergrowth species such as bushes, grass, etc.
Among the socio-economic impacts of the construction of the grid station on the free-of-cost 32-kanal land were eye and respiratory diseases from routine exposure of construction workers to dust and exhaust emissions on the project site.
Pak-EPA maintained that the overall impact assessment, more especially the nature and magnitude of the residual environmental impacts identified during the environment impact assessment (EIA), the 132KV grid station, and its 132KV feeding transmission line were likely to cause environmental impacts mainly during its construction phase. Pak-EPA emphasised that the environmental impacts could be mitigated provided the proposed activities were carried out as mentioned in the EIA report.
Some of the mitigation measures suggested in the report were: minimising soil erosion; construction of temporary walls bordering the construction area to contain debris and soil; septic tanks and soakage pits with adequate capacity; collecting waste oils; and separating recyclable waste.
The report also recommended restoring natural vegetation loss, besides a ban on blasting and nighttime construction work and minimising illumination at night.
It also recommended a 15-kilometre speed limit for vehicles at the construction site.
Pak-EPA also recommended thorough health screening and training of construction workers, especially to monitor eye and respiratory diseases.
In the last month, Pak-EPA has held two public hearings for feedback from residents on the health and environmental impacts of the construction of the Garden Residence project in Sector F-10. The other public hearing was on infrastructure development works for sub-sector G-15/3.

ISLAMABAD: Lovehandmade.co hosted ‘The Maker’s Muse’, a craft exhibition showcasing exquisite artisanship from Sindh. 
Lovehandmade.co is a distinct social enterprise founded in 2020 as a response to economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic on female home-based workers (FHBWs).
Lovehandmade.co has worked with approximately a hundred artisans in hard-to-reach areas, nurturing their talents and capabilities, and imparting both soft and hard skills essential for personal and professional growth.
Founded by Zein Ahmed, who has been tirelessly championing the rights of home-based workers, using her platform and expertise to advocate for fair wages, safe working conditions and economic opportunities, Lovehandmade.co exhibited beautiful, handcrafted products.
It has collaborated with the Light-F project, funded by the Japan International Cooperative Agency (JICA) and the Women Development Department of the Sindh government to uplift and fortify female home-based workers in rural Sindh. 
The Graduation Model by Light-F aims to facilitate the gradual transition of home-based workers to sustainable livelihoods by focusing on three key areas of intervention – life management capacity development, financial access promotion and income generation support. 
Zein Ahmed said: “At Lovehandmade.co, we believe economic empowerment is just one thread in the tapestry of a woman’s potential. By providing skills, resources and a platform, we empower artisans to not just survive, but thrive. 
Their journey of growth transforms not only their lives, but their families and communities, creating a ripple effect of positive change.” 
On display were exquisite Ajrak products – kurtis, pouches, masks, kitchen sets, chaddars, scarves – using natural dyes and combining traditional skills and patterns with innovations in motifs and placements. The Ajrak serves as a symbol of cultural richness and Sindhi heritage.
Pit loom scarves, shawls and towels, used a technique that traces back centuries, where the loom is set in a pit on the ground, ensuring utmost precision in every weave. The products reflected a blend of age-old craftsmanship and contemporary style. 
The most expansive collection was that of exquisite Ralli blankets, using various techniques such as patchwork, barcode, evil eye, Rang Diamond, J Ralli with borders, et cetera. Each stitch told vibrant tales of Sindh craftsmanship, weaving a symphony of tradition and allure. 
Dulais, an age-old favourite in summer coverings, had some lovely motifs and were stuffed with 100pc pure cotton, as was the tradition. Also crafted were some Amigurumi key chains, with small, stuffed elephants. 
Speaking on the occasion, British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said: “I absolutely adore the Lovehandmade range. Stylish and smart, and helping empower Pakistan’s female rural artisans. I’m also pleased that the UK could support the early phases of this start up. People from London to Islamabad have stopped me to ask where my Lovehandmade tote bag is from.”
Myriam Chaudron said: “Today we were lucky enough to visit a beautiful exhibition organised by Zein, a particularly generous and gifted woman who gives a lot of her time to empower poor Pakistani women through handicrafts.”
She said this exhibition of multicoloured Pakistani handicrafts was a testament to the beautiful traditions of Sindh and the incredible talent and resilience of the women artisans. 
“The work of these women, which came into being thanks to Zein, not only preserves cultural heritage but also uplifts entire families, offering them sustainable livelihoods and brighter futures. By supporting this exhibition, we not only acquire beautiful crafts but also contribute to a positive cycle of empowerment and economic growth,” she added.

10,‘Better-funded emergency rooms to reduce children’s deaths by 50pc’,"ISLAMABAD: While every year 600,000 children die in the emergency room (ER) across the country, the number can be...","ISLAMABAD: While every year 600,000 children die in the emergency room (ER) across the country, the number can be reduced by 50 per cent by pumping just a nominal amount of money (Rs2,000 per child) to improve the emergency response.
ChildLife Foundation Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr Ahsan Rabbani made these remarks in a conversation with Dawn.
“It is unfortunate that the number of children who die in the ER is more than the number of deaths due to cancer and a number of other lethal diseases in Pakistan. We can reduce the deaths of children in ER by pumping a nominal amount in ER,” he said.
While sharing the details, he said: “The foundation gets 60 per cent funding from the government and arranges 40pc remaining amount from philanthropists. We have been working across the country and providing treatment to children up to 14 years of age at ERs. We don’t leave those children after providing treatment at the ER, then children are sent to the ward for observation. Once we believe that children are out of danger, we suggest their parents shift them to some other/public sector hospital so that some other deserving children would be adjusted to those beds. However, a majority of them don’t need further hospitalisation.”
“We have been mostly operating in the premises of public sector hospitals as the federal and provincial government have given us premises to support them in the noble cause of saving lives,” Dr Rabbani said while he was at the Children’s Emergency Room at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). He said that the new children’s emergency room at Pims managed by ChildLife Foundation, has successfully treated 200,000 children, since its establishment in August 2022.
“This milestone marks a significant achievement in combating child mortality rates in Pakistan, with the survival rate of critically ill children notably on the rise. Pakistan faces a critical issue as almost 2,000 children succumb to various illnesses daily, making it imperative to address the high mortality rates among children in the country. Recognising this challenge, the foundation has implemented a solution-focused approach, emphasising the importance of enhancing emergency care to effectively reduce child mortality rates by 50pc,” he said.
It is worth mentioning that operating under a public-private partnership with the government, the foundation revitalised the children’s emergency room at Pims in August 2022.
Dr Rabbani said one of the key highlights of the newly revamped emergency room was its pharmacy, which maintained a 45-day stock of essential medicines, including life-saving drugs.
“This strategic measure ensures that critical medications are readily available at all times, further enhancing the emergency response capabilities of the facility. 
The foundation’s impact extends far beyond Pims, with a scalable and cost-effective model operating in 313 hospitals nationwide, including emergency rooms and telemedicine satellite centres. 
Serving over 10,000 children every month in ER at Pims, from various regions, including Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Punjab, KP, Gilgit-Baltistan, and AJK,” he said.
According to the website of the foundation, infectious diseases and preventable conditions claim the lives of hundreds of children in low-income countries. According to Unicef, Pakistan has an under-five mortality rate (U5MR) of 74 deaths/1,000 live births. 
The leading causes of death among children under the age of five are preterm birth complications, pneumonia, diarrhoea, birth asphyxia, and malaria and most of these deaths can be prevented by simple, low-cost interventions. 
As many as 92,000 children die of pneumonia every year in Pakistan, the illness accounts for 16pc of total child deaths in the country.
