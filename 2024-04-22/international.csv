0,UN pushes justice for Sri Lanka’s Easter victims,Top envoy tells remembrance service that there should be a “thorough and transparent investigation” to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.,"COLOMBO: The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its  “accountability deficit” and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.
The UN’s top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a  “thorough and transparent investigation” to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.
Bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island’s deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.
Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.
“Sri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,” Franche said.
He noted that victims were still seeking justice despite the country’s Supreme Court holding the then president Maithripala Sirisena and his top officials responsible for failing to prevent the attack.
“Delivering justice for victims of these attacks should be part of addressing the systemic challenge,” Franche said.
He said the UN Human Rights office has also called on Colombo to publish the complete findings of previous inquiries into the Easter Sunday bombings and to establish an independent investigation.

1,South Korea protests Japanese leaders’ offerings to Yasukuni shrine,SEOUL: South Korea on Sunday protested Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s offering to Tokyo’s Yasukuni...,"SEOUL: South Korea on Sunday protested Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s offering to Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine with  “deep disappointment” and urged Japanese leaders to show repentance for the country’s wartime past.
The shrine is seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan’s past military aggression because it includes 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal among the 2.5 million war dead honoured there.
Past offerings there by Japanese leaders have led to protests from the two countries.
Kishida and some cabinet members sent ritual offerings to the shrine on Sunday, Yonhap news agency reported, citing Japanese media.
“The government expresses deep disappointment and regret that Japanese leaders again sent offerings to or visited the Yasukuni shrine which glorifies Japan’s war of aggression and enshrines war criminals,” South Korea’s foreign ministry said.
South Korea’s urges Japanese leaders to  “face history squarely and demons­trate humble reflection and sincere repentance” which would be an important foundation for improved ties between the two countries, it said in a statement. It did not mention Kishida by name.
The two countries have moved closer in ties after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol made it a foreign policy priority to improve security cooperation with Tokyo and Washington since taking office in 2022.

2,Doctors cite unmedicated mental illness in Sydney attack,Joel Cauchi’s parents say their son was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 17 and was successfully treated for about 18 years.,"SYDNEY: No one can know the mind of Sydney shopping mall killer Joel Cauchi, but psychiatrists say one underlying cause of his rampage is evident: he had schizophrenia, stopped his medication and fell out of treatment.
People have searched for a fathomable motive since the April 13 knife attack at Bondi Junction, in which five women and a male security guard were stabbed to death and another dozen wounded, including a nine-month-old girl.
Cauchi’s parents have said their son was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 17 and was successfully treated for about 18 years. A serious mental disorder, schizophrenia can cause hallucinations, delusions and disordered behaviour. It requires lifelong treatment.
New South Wales police commissioner Karen Webb said it was  “obvious” to her and detectives that the 40-year-old Cauchi had targeted women and avoided men, sparking a media debate about misogyny in Australia.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the gender breakdown among the victims as  “concerning” and vowed to do more to combat violence against women, citing a toll of one woman dying at the hands of a man they knew every week.
“But we will never know what was in the mind of the perpetrator of these acts,” said professor Ian Hickie, co-director of health and policy at the University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre. “Ordinary people are trying to impose a rational explanation,” he said.

3,Ukraine strikes Russian ship in annexed Crimea,Kremlin claims advances near Chasiv Yar as Kyiv hails fresh aid,"KYIV: Ukraine said on Sunday its navy had struck a salvage ship belonging to Russia’s Black Sea fleet on the annexed Crimean peninsula, putting it out of service.
It did not say where the attack took place, but social media footage purportedly filmed in the Crimean port of Sevastopol showed a ship in flames.
“Today, the Ukrainian Navy hit the Russian salvage ship ‘Kom­muna’ in temporarily occupied Cri­mea,” Ukraine’s defence ministry said.
The Russian navy used the ship for deep-sea work, including raising submarines and sunken cargo, and was one of the oldest in service, Ukraine said. Ukrainian navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk said the damage caused by the attack was unclear but that the ship was  “no longer capable of performing its tasks”.

Kremlin claims advances near Chasiv Yar as Kyiv hails fresh aid

“This will continue to happen until the Russians run out of ships or leave Crimea,” he said. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said earlier that Moscow’s military had  “repelled an attack by an anti-ship missile” on a vessel at the port.
He did not say which ship was attacked, but said  “fallen fragments caused a small fire, which was promptly extinguished.”
Chasiv Yar gains
Russia  said on Sunday its forces had gained territory near the key battleground  town of Chasiv Yar in east Ukraine, highlighting the pressure facing  Kyiv as it gears up to receive $61 billion in new US aid. Russia  said it had taken control of Bogdanivka, a small frontline  village less than three kilometres (two miles) northeast of Chasiv Yar.
“Units  of the southern grouping of troops have completely liberated the  settlement of Bogdanivka,” Moscow’s defence ministry said. Chasiv  Yar, which had a pre-war population of about 13,000, has been largely  destroyed by fighting and most of its residents have fled.
Echoes of Vietnam and Afghanistan wars
Russia said US lawmakers’ support for $60.84 billion more  in aid for Ukraine showed that Washington was wading much deeper into a  hybrid war against Moscow that would end in humiliation on a par with  the Vietnam or Afghanistan conflicts.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman  Maria Zakharova said it was clear that the United States wanted Ukraine   “to fight to the last Ukrai­nian” including with attacks on Russian  sovereign territory and civilians.
“Washington’s deeper and deeper  immersion in the hybrid war against Russia will turn into a loud and  humiliating fiasco for United States such as Vietnam and Afghanistan,”  Zakharova said.
The decision by the US House of Representatives to earmark $61  billion in long-delayed aid for Ukraine shows the country will not  become  “a second Afghanistan,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said  on Sunday.“This aid will strengthen Ukraine and send the  Kremlin a powerful signal that it will not be the second Afghanistan,”  Zelensky said in an interview with NBC’s  “Meet the Press.”  “The United  States will stay with Ukraine, will protect Ukrainians, and... they’ll protect democracy in the world,” he added.
The  Kremlin has sought to play down the impact of the new US aid, arguing it  would only deepen Washington’s  “immersion” in the war.

4,Separatists eye historic win in Basque vote,MADRID: Spain’s nor­thern Basque Country votes in a regional election that polls suggest will be won by the...,"MADRID: Spain’s nor­thern Basque Country votes in a regional election that polls suggest will be won by the left-wing separatist Bildu, seen as the heir of the political wing of the defunct armed separatist group ETA.
The outcome could leave Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s ruling Socialist Worker’s party in the difficult position of having to decide between two key parliamentary allies.
Polls predict a victory for EH Bildu, a coalition which has worked to disasso­ciate itself from ETA whose bloody struggle for an inde­pen­dent Basque home­land claimed 850 lives before it rejected violence in 2011.
More than 700 polling stations opened at 9:00am with some 1.8 million voters eligible to cast their ballots for 75 lawmakers in the Basque regional parliament. By 1pm, participation stood at 28 per cent, offi­cials said. Voting closes at 8pm.
With a large following among young people thanks to its strong stance on social issues, Bildu has climbed steadily in the polls and now looks set to win the most votes.
“We are facing an opportunity for a change that leaves behind outdat­ed policies and ways of doing politics, and reverses the sense of inertia,” Bildu’s candidate for regional lea­der, Pello Otxandiano, told reporters after voting in his hometown of Otxandio.
“We’re making a massive appeal for people to get out and vote for change today.” If polls are correct, Bildu looks set for a historic win, inching ahead of separatist Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), a centrist faction that has ruled the region for decades.

5,"Two killed, six injured  in US party shooting",WASHINGTON: Two peo­ple were killed and six others wounded in a shooting at a block party on Saturday in the US ...,"WASHINGTON: Two peo­ple were killed and six others wounded in a shooting at a block party on Saturday in the US city of Memphis, local police said.
Two people were found deceased at the scene, and one of the six wounded  “remains in critical condi­tion” at an area hospital, the Memphis Police Department wrote on social media platform X.
The shooting occurred at an unpermitted block party with about 200 to 300 people near Orange Mound Park in the sout­hern state of Tennessee, the depart­ment said on X earlier.
Gun violence is common in the United States, a country where there are more firearms than people. Attempts to clamp down on gun rights are always met with stiff political resistance.
The United States has recorded 120 mass shoo­tings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nongovern­mental organization that defines a mass shooting as four or more people wounded or killed. Last year ended with a total of 656 such shootings.
“During  the follow-up investigation, we learned that there were 8 total  victims, with two of those being deceased on the scene,” Memphis police  said in an updated statement posted on X. Police had earlier said that 16 people were shot.
“This  was a block party that was occurring with­out a permit”, police said.  The block party had about 200-300 people in atten­dance. At least two suspects are being sought, CBS News said, citing Memphis Police interim chief Cerelyn Davis.

6,Women journalists bear the brunt of cyberbullying,"PERUGIA (Italy): Women journalists face greater threats online in the course of their work, and the trend is...","PERUGIA (Italy): Women journalists face greater threats online in the course of their work, and the trend is increasing, one expert told an international conference in Italy this weekend.
“There is significant potential for online violence to escalate to offline harm,” said Julie Posetti research director of the International Centre for Journalists (ICFJ).
“Women tend to face greater threats online,” she told delegates at the Perugia International Journalism Festival on Saturday. And, she added,  “the kind of threats they face are increasing”.
That toxic environment was being  “facilitated by Big Tech companies”, she added, accusing them of  “a failure to take responsibility”.
In a joint Unesco/ICFJ study in 2022, nearly three-quarters of women journalists interviewed said they had experienced online violence or abuse in connection with their work. They interviewed 900 journalists from 125 countries.
Attacks online include insults, sexist and sexual comments, and physical threats, including death threats to journalists and their families, the conference heard.
Increasingly sophisticated attacks include blocking accounts, hacking, publishing private photos and creating  “deep fakes” — fake sexual images of people without their consent. Violent threats tend to increase when combined with discrimination linked to skin colour, religion or sexual orientation.
Physical violence
Posetti and two other researchers have built a guide and toolbox on the topic targeting journalists, together with the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE). Filipino journalist Maria Ressa, the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize winner, was a victim of online abuse, as she explained in the ICFJ-Unesco report.
“I was a CNN war correspondent for two decades, but nothing in the field prepared me for the orchestrated, misogynistic attacks on me and our women-led news outlet, Rappler,” she said. BBC disinformation specialist Marianna Spring received an avalanche of abusive tweets last year, threatening to kidnap her or slit her throat.
Much of the abuse followed her investigation into the takeover of social media network X, then known as Twitter. In some cases, online threats can translate into physical violence.
A fifth of women surveyed said they had suffered attacks or insults in real life that were linked to online abuse.
The consequences can be far-reaching, with some journalists potentially dissuaded from covering sensitive topics and some choosing to opt out of the industry altogether. Paris-based media rights campaigners Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has warned that this type of harassment forms a new threat to press freedom.
Developing counter measures
French journalist Nadia Daam said that she received a flood of hateful messages in 2017 after a column that criticised an online forum. Since then, she has moved house twice and tends to stay away from social media, but says she still gets cyber-bullying messages and  “doesn’t work the same anymore”.
However, she thinks there is more awareness of the problem now, saying that she believes the wider industry  “talks more about cyberharassment”, with more severe legal sentences.

Sabah al-Salem Haniyeh, 57, lives in the southern Israeli town of Tel Sheva. Her brother is based in Qatar, as are other officials from Hamas, the group that rules the Gaza Strip.
Haniyeh has been held in custody since her arrest on April 1, Israel’s justice ministry said. There was no immediate comment from her lawyer.
According to the indictment, in the days after Hamas’ Oct 7 raid in southern Israel, Haniyeh sent messages to dozens of contacts, including to her brother, praising the cross-border assault and calling for further  “slaughter”.
One of her messages mentioned in the indictment allegedly includes the line:  “Oh God, count them and kill them and don’t leave any of them, Oh God.”

8,Baby in Gaza saved from womb of mother killed in Israeli strike,Doctors wrote ‘the baby of the martyr Sabreen Al-Sakani’ on tape across her chest.,"RAFAH: A baby girl was delivered from the womb of a Palestinian killed along with her husband and daughter by an Israeli attack in the Gaza city of Rafah, where 19 people died overnight in intensified strikes, Palestinian health officials said. The dead, killed in hits on two houses, included 13 children from one family, they said.
The baby, weighing 1.4 kg (3.09 lb) and delivered in an emergency C-section, was stable and improving gradually, said Mohammed Salama, a doctor caring for her.
Her mother, Sabreen Al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant.
The baby was placed in an incubator in a Rafah hospital alongside another infant, with the words  “The baby of the martyr Sabreen Al-Sakani” written on tape across her chest.

Doctors wrote ‘the baby of the martyr Sabreen Al-Sakani’ on tape across her chest

Sakani’s young daughter Malak, who was killed in the strike, had wanted to name her new sister Rouh, meaning spirit in Arabic, said her uncle Rami Al-Sheikh.  
“The little girl Malak was happy that her sister was coming to the world,” he said.
The baby would stay in hospital for three to four weeks, said Salama, the doctor.  “After that we will see about her leaving, and where this child will go, to the family, to the aunt or uncle or grandparents. Here is the biggest tragedy. Even if this child survives, she was born an orphan,” he said.
The 13 children were killed in a strike on the second home, belonging to the Abdel Aal family, according to Palestinian health officials. Two women were also killed in that strike.
Asked about the casualties in Rafah, an Israeli military spokesperson, however, said “various militant targets were struck in Gaza including military compounds, launch posts and armed people”.
“Did you see one man in all of those killed?” said Saqr Abdel Aal, a Palestinian man whose family were among the dead, grieving over the body of a child in a white shroud.
“All are women and children,” he said.  “My entire identity has been wiped out, with my wife, children and everyone.”  Mohammad al-Behairi said his daughter and grandchild were still under the rubble. 
“It’s a feeling of sadness, depression, we have nothing left in this life to cry for, what feeling shall we have? When you lose your children, when you lose the closest of your loved ones, how will your feeling be?” he said.
Over half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have crowded into Rafah, seeking shelter from the Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of the Gaza Strip over the last six months.
Israel is threatening a ground offensive into the area. President Joe Biden has urged Israel not to launch a large-scale offensive in Rafah to avoid more Palestinian civilian casualties.

9,"Israel holds Palestinian economy captive, say analysts","JERUSALEM: The Gaza crisis is speeding up Israel’s  “annexation” of the Palestinian economy, say analysts, who...","JERUSALEM: The Gaza crisis is speeding up Israel’s  “annexation” of the Palestinian economy, say analysts, who argue it has been hobbled for decades by agreements that followed the Oslo peace accords.
While the Israeli aggression since October 7 has devastated swathes of Gaza, it has also hit the public finances and wider economy of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israel is tightening the noose on the Palestinian Authority, which rules parts of the West Bank, by withholding tax reve­nues it collects on its behalf, economist Adel Samara said.
Palestinian livelihoods have also been hurt by bans on labourers crossing into Israel, and by a sharp downturn in tourism in the violence-plagued territory, including a quiet Christmas season in Bethlehem. Samara said that  “techni­cally speaking, there is no Palestinian economy under Israeli occupation — our economy has been effectively annexed by Israel’s”.
The Palestinian economy is largely governed by the 1994 Paris Protocol, which granted sole control over the territories’ borders to Israel, and with it the right to collect import duties and value-added tax for the Palestinian Authority.
Israel has repeatedly levera­ged this power to deprive the authority of much-needed revenues. But the Gaza crisis has further tightened Israel’s grip, Samara said, with the bulk of customs duties withheld since October 7.
“Without these funds, the Palestinian Authority strugg­les to pay the salaries of its civil servants and its running costs,” said Taher al-Labadi, a researcher at the French Institute for the Near East.
In February, Norway reportedly transferred to the Palestinian Authority about $115 million from Israel following a deal to release some of the frozen taxes.
Almost all Palestinian workers have also been forbidden from entering Israel for work, driving up unemployment across the territories. The Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa bemoaned an  “unprecedented financial crisis” during which his government’s deficit had soared to $7 billion, more than a third of the territories’ GDP according to the latest budgetary figures.
‘Collective punishment’
The Paris Protocol, like the 1993 and 1995 Oslo agreements they were signed under, were meant to be in effect for five years, until the creation of a Palestinian state. But the absence of a long-term peace deal means it is still governing nearly all aspects of the Palestinian economy.
Investment is also being stifled by the protocol, said Samara, who explained that Israel  “controls the land, resources and water sources” of the Palestinian territories.
Before any factory or shop requiring access to these resources can be built in the West Bank, Israel must grant authorisation, he said.
Israel’s stance has become even tougher under far-right Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, he said, both of whom are settlers in the West Bank.
Critics accuse them of holding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ransom by threatening to withdraw the support that gives him a wafer-thin governing majority.
Israeli political analyst Michael Milshtein echoed his take.
“By not allowing Palestinian workers into Israel and withholding Palestinian tax revenues, Ben Gvir and Smotrich aim to overthrow the Palestinian Authority because they view it as an enemy,” he said.
“It’s a way to collectively punish Palestinians, whom they also see as enemies.” Milshtein said that before October 7, nearly one-third of West Bank income came from the earnings of the 193,000 Palestinians who worked in Israel, according to Israeli figures.
Today, the number of Palestinians working in Israel has dropped to between 8,000 and 9,000, he said.
‘To live in dignity’
But Milshtein also pointed to another strain of Israeli opinion, held by centrist minister Benny Gantz and conservative lawmaker Gideon Saar.
They want to allow workers back into Israel to avoid anger sparking an uprising in the West Bank, at a time when Israeli forces are already stretched between Gaza and the Lebanese border, where they are trading fire with Hezbollah. Milshtein said he believes Netanyahu is probably closer to the Gantz view.
Nasr Abdel Kareem, an economics professor at the Arab American University in the West Bank, argued that the Israeli premier is playing a power game.
“Netanyahu is putting pressure on the Palestinians and signalling to the authority that the levers of the Palestinian economy are in (Israel’s) hands,” he said.
“Netanyahu believes that he will weaken the authority and make it accept political concessions” when a peace agreement eventually has to be hammered out, he said.
This strategy may be misguided, said Nasr, because it is based on the premise that letting the Palestinian economy flourish would automatically bring peace to the West Bank.
“Historically, previous uprisings broke out” when times were not tough economically, he said, adding that ultimately Palestinians want a state as much as a healthy economy.
“Palestinians want to live with dignity, but for them this also implies liberation and the establishment of a Palestinian state.”

10,Climate protesters wrap Swedish  parliament in giant red scarf,STOCKHOLM: Several hundred women surrounded Sweden’s parliament with a giant knitted red scarf on Sunday to ...,"STOCKHOLM: Several hundred women surrounded Sweden’s parliament with a giant knitted red scarf on Sunday to protest political inaction over global warming, a journalist observed.
Responding to a call from the Mothers Rebellion movement, the women marched around the Riksdag with the scarf made of 3,000 smaller scarves, urging politicians to honour a commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
“I am here for my child Dinalo and for all the kids. I am angry and sad that politicians in Sweden are acting against the climate,” Katarina Utne, 41, a mother of a four-year-old and human resources coach, said.
The women unfurled their scarves and marched for several hundred metres, singing and holding placards calling to  “save the climate for the children’s future”.
“The previous govern­ment was acting too slowly. The current government is going in the wrong direction in terms of climate policy,” said psychologist Sara Nilsson Loov, referring to a recent report on Swedish climate policy.
The government, led by the conservative Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and supported by the far-right Sweden Democrats, is in danger of failing to meet its 2030 climate targets, an agency tasked with evaluating climate policy recently reported.
According to the Swedish Climate Policy Council, the government has made decisions, including financial decisi­ons, that will increase greenhouse gas emissions in the short term.
“Ordinary people have to step up. Sweden is not the worst country but has been better previously,” 67-year-old pensioner Charlotte Bellander said.
The global movement, Mothers Rebellion, was established by a group of mothers in Sweden, Germany, the USA, Zambia and Uganda.
It organises peaceful movements in public spaces by sitting and singing but does not engage in civil disobedience, unlike the Extinction Rebellion movement, which some of its organisers came from.

11,Splashy Saudi mega-project NEOM chases Chinese funds,HONG KONG: Bigwigs behind a Saudi megacity dogged by questions about its viability have wrapped up a tour courting...,"HONG KONG: Bigwigs behind a Saudi megacity dogged by questions about its viability have wrapped up a tour courting Chinese investors, detailing plans for a futuristic ski resort and 170-kilometre-long skys­crapers.
The roadshow for NEOM, brainchild of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, travelled from Beijing to Shanghai to Hong Kong, where for two days would-be business partners flocked to a chic museum to peruse eye-popping renderings in various stages of development.
No major deals were announced, and top project officials did not address recent reports that NEOM’s ambitious construction and population targets are being rolled back.
But they did offer a glimpse into how NEOM has evolved since Prince Mohammed first announced it in 2017, raising eyebrows for the $500 billion price tag.
NEOM’s executive director Tarek Qaddumi walked journalists through an exhibition at Hong Kong’s M+ museum on Friday, talking up NEOM’s goal of balancing  “nature conservation, human livability and economic prosperity”.
“NEOM is a very vast vision... It is an initiative that is probably the most exciting and the most forward-looking in the 21st century,” he said.
The exhibition helped make NEOM  “less mysterious”, and reactions during an invitation-only reception were  “mostly neutral”, said Leonard Chan, chair of the Hong Kong Innovative Technology Development Association.
He demurred, though, when discussing whether he had been sold on living in NEOM’s centrepiece known as The Line, two mirror-encased skyscrapers extending over 170 kilometres (105 miles) across the Saudi desert.
“I’ll visit for fun, but I won’t live there. It’s like something out of SimCity,” he said.
“Maybe if I live there, I won’t want to leave, and it’s like being isolated from the world and I just can’t stand that.” Plato Yip, chair of the environmental group Friends of the Earth in Hong Kong who is exploring green hydrogen deals with NEOM, similarly said The Line  “feels like being caged inside, even though it may be very comfortable.” 
Shortening ‘The Line’?
Unveiling The Line in 2022, Prince Mohammed said its population would exceed one million by 2030 before climbing to nine million by 2045. However Bloomberg reported this month that under revised projections just 300,000 people would be living in The Line by decade’s end, and only 2.4 kilometres of the project would be completed by then. NEOM did not respond to a request for comment about the Bloomberg report.
Standing on Friday near a model of The Line — a gleaming blade slicing inland from the Red Sea — Qaddumi said only that the population target of nine million would be met  “over time”.
He described features of The Line including a 650-metre-long  “cantilever” jutting into the Gulf of Aqaba as well as a  “hidden marina”. He also said construction was underway on tunnels that would allow The Line to pass through desert mountains and an airport expected to welcome 100 million passengers a year and offer a  “seamless approach” to the city.
“You’ll get off the plane and walk into the city. We will eliminate all the hassle of going through an airport, whether it’s immigration or security or even... receiving your baggage at the airport. Your baggage will be sent to your address directly.” Apart from The Line, Qaddumi said the luxury yachting island Sindalah was  “well under construction” and would  “be completed by the end of the year, ready for visitors to spend some time in NEOM”.
Trojena, the futuristic ski resort boasting a manmade lake and 36 kilometres of slopes, must be finished before 2029, when it is set to host the Asian Winter Games.
Other elements of NEOM, including some waterfront residential developments in the Oxagon region, will be built  “after 2030”, Qaddumi said.
Courting investors
NEOM’s investor roadshow has also included stops in Europe and the United States.
The megacity is progressing alongside other major development projects launched as part of Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed’s bid to position the world’s biggest crude exporter for an eventual post-oil future.
Last year the Gulf kingdom emerged as the only bidder to host the 2034 World Cup, meaning it now has a decade to build the necessary stadiums and boost its lodging and transport capacity.
In December Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said officials had decided to push the timeframe for some major projects past 2030, without specifying which ones.
“Certain projects can be expanded for three years — so it’s 2033 — some will be expanded to 2035, some will be expanded even beyond that and some will be rationalised,” he said.
Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington said projects tied to specific events would likely be prioritised.
“The Saudis were not going to be able to move 100 miles per hour in every direction on the development front indefinitely,” he said, adding that Riyadh needs consistent, sustainable foreign investment growth from various sectors. “It’s no secret that they haven’t achieved that yet.”
