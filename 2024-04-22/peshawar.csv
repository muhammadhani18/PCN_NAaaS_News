0,200 college teachers in KP get salary without taking classes,HED secretary says he is working to rationalise postings.,"PESHAWAR: Around 200 teachers of higher education department posted at different government degree colleges in parts of the province draw salaries without taking classes as they have been posted irrationally and on wrong positions, according to documents.
According to official data, another 679 teachers in government colleges were not meeting the required credit hours.
The department has fixed two credit hours per day according to its policy but these teachers have only one credit hour.
The directorate of higher education has notified workload of each teacher that is 12 credit hours in a week while relaxation has been made of three credit hours for the faculty assigned other duties including coordinator, controller, examiners and chief proctors in the respective colleges.

HED secretary says he is working to rationalise postings

On the other hand, the irrational posting and transfers of has shifted the burden to 808 teachers serving in different colleges, who are forced to attend additional classes in their respective colleges due to shortage of staffers.
The data shows that six professors in BPS-20 posted in different colleges, 33 associate professors in BPS-19, 61 assistant professors in BPS-18 and 85 lecturers in BPS-17 are not attending classes.
The teachers, who attend half of their classes, include 31 professors in BPS-20, 195 associate professors in BPS-19, 163 assistant professors in BPS-18 and 285 lecturers in BPS-17.
The teachers, who are overburdened and attend additional classes beyond their capacity, include 16 professors in BPS-20, 84 associate professors in BPS-19, 238 assistant professors in BPS-18 and 270 lecturers in BPS-17.
Higher Education Secretary Arshed Khan told Dawn that he was working on rationalising the posting of teachers in government colleges in the larger interest of students.
He said that he had compiled data of the students enrolled in colleges and teachers working there.
A few days back, the secretary said, keeping in view the available data he turned down the proposal to transfer two teachers of a subject to a government college as two teachers were already teaching 88 students there.
He said that no teacher was available for 400 students in a government college in Karak. “I directed the officials concerned to immediately post at least three teachers for those students, who have no teacher to teach them,” he added.
Pertaining to the rationalisation of teachers-students ratio, Mr Khan said that he had started interviewing principals of government colleges on daily basis and was obtaining information about their requirement for teachers and other facilities.
Sources told Dawn that actually the minister and secretaries of higher education were responsible for irrationality in the transfer of teachers.
“For instance, if there is a vacant seat for Urdu teacher in BPS-19 in a government college, which is located in urban area or important city like Peshawar, HED orders posting of a mathematics teacher there in the same grade,” they added.
However, after posting on the wrong position, the mathematics teacher couldn’t teach Urdu because in colleges only a teacher specialised in subject could teach the same subject. “Wrong posting can be managed at school level but it is not possible in higher education institutions,” they added.
Sources said that teachers were using their contacts with the lawmakers, ministers and high authorities to get posting on wrong positions. They added that such teachers were unable to teach in colleges.
They said that principals of government degree colleges had also reservations over wrong postings as it caused academic losses to students.

Noorul Amin was arrested by the police on suspicion of his involvement in drug smuggling three days before Eidul Fitr, and was shifted to Jamrud sub-jail.  
Jail authorities insisted Amin had a heart attack and was immediately shifted to Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar, but could not survive. 
His relatives, however, suspected the police torture caused his death, and brought his body first to the Jamrud Bazaar and later shifted their protest to the bypass road, demanding a probe into his ‘sudden death inside jail’. 
Jail authorities also insisted neither they nor relatives of the deceased, in his early 50s, could find any torture signs on his body.  
The prolonged road closure suspended vehicular traffic to Torkham border with a large number of loaded vehicles stranded on both sides of the artery. 
The protesters agreed to end the protest only after MNA Iqbal Afridi’s assurance about an impartial inquiry into the death of Amin and suspension of Jamrud SHO Adnan Afridi.

3,Hydropower station helps increase forest cover in Chitral village,Residents say flash floods in the mountainous village have also come to an end since the cutting of trees was stopped over the last three years.,"CHITRAL: Residents of Sorech village in the Rech sub-valley of Upper Chitral district said they had not chopped down a single tree for cooking and heating purposes since the commissioning of the hydropower station in their village three years ago, thereby increasing the forest cover. 
Talking to reporters here on Sunday, Mohammad Nadir, Abdul Nasir, Iqbal Murad and Musa Khan said that during the extended winter season of five months, they used fuel wood in large quantity, harvesting hundreds of trees every year as it was the only source available to them. 
However, they said that the power project of 500 kilowatt constructed by Aga Khan Rural Support Programme under its Central Asian Poverty Programme had relieved them of the issue of firewood. 
The residents said that flash floods in the mountainous village had also come to an end since the cutting of trees was stopped over the last three years. 
They said that the village organisation fixed the lowest possible rate of electricity per unit at only Rs4. They said that the 186 households lavishly used the power for cooking, heating and lighting purposes. 
They added that the provision of cheap electricity had brought convenience to them in different fields, saying women had also started using power for promotion of local embroidery and weaving products. 
The residents said that the amount of money, which many people spent on purchasing wood, was now utilised for raising the standard of their living, while the use of green energy had also helped decrease a number of diseases caused by excessive inhaling of carbon emitted by firewood.

6,Govt likely to replace BoGs of teaching hospitals this week,Prof Nausherwan says bureaucratic hurdles delay removal of boards,"PESHAWAR: The provincial government is likely to remove the existing board of governors of medical teaching institutions (MTIs) this week, according to sources.
“The provincial government is expected to identify the existing BoGs of MTIs and announce new ones by Tuesday. The government is facing bureaucratic hurdles in removing boards,” Prof Nausherwan Burki told Dawn.
He said that he was waiting for replacement of BoGs by the government but it was delayed due to health department’s laxity to deal with bureaucratic obstacles.
Prof Burki, the architect of Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act (MTIRA) passed by the provincial assembly in 2015, said that he was in contact with the government and soon new BoGs would be announced after which he would come to resume work on his unfinished agenda of reforms in health sector.

Prof Nausherwan says bureaucratic hurdles delay removal of boards

The PTI-led coalition government enforced MTIRA in 2015 at Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar and kept it extending to the teaching hospitals and their affiliated medical and dental colleges in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
So far, the law has been implemented in 10 medical teaching institutions of the province to grant financial and administrative autonomy to them and free them from the bureaucratic and political control. The law is also meant to improve patient care at hospitals and develop medical education in the province.
Initially, government officers were made members of BoGs along with private individuals but later on only private members ran the respective MTIs. As per law, BoGs have powers to receive one-line budget from the provincial government and spend the same in accordance with their needs. These boards are authorised to demolish any post, create new one and re-designate positions due to which the provincial bureaucrats has lost their control over MTIs and only BoGs run the show.
Keeping in view the vast powers enjoyed by BoGs, the caretaker government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa first tried to do away with MTIRA and revive the old system and give control of the MTI-covered hospitals and colleges back to health department.
However, the caretakers were informed by legal experts that the law could be reversed only through provincial assembly, which had passed it. Subsequently, the provincial cabinet in March last year removed the BoGs and appointed new ones. These BoGs are still in place in the teaching hospitals of the province.
Sources said that health department was facing pressure from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf to replace the boards. They said that health department was not able to remove the current BoGs of medical teaching institutions appointed by caretakers but issued two warnings to them to stay away from taking major decisions.
However, these directives of the health department have fallen on deaf ears as lately BoGs of MTIs Abbottabad and Bannu have made major decisions in violation of the orders.
“Such situation is the source of embarrassment for those, who initiated the reform process. Therefore, we want to appoint our own BoGs and resume work,” a senior PTI leader told this scribe.
He said that there was no point in delaying the replacement of boards as PTI had vast majority in the assembly and there was virtually no opposition.
He said that Prof Nausherwan Burki would likely assume the roles of MTI-Policy Board chief and chairman of BoG of LRH while some other people, who remained part of the PTI-era BoGs, would be selected again.
“We have also complained to PTI’s founder Imran Khan in jail to issue directives to Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to replace the BoGs. We are not sure if Imran Khan has issued directives to CM or not,” said the PTI leader.

12,Probe ordered into appointment of Class-IV employees in mines dept,Petitioners claim recruitments made on political grounds,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court has directed the director general of mines and minerals to conduct an inquiry into appointment of four low ranking employees in the department allegedly on directives of the then chief minister in Swat in 2020.
A bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar and Justice Shahid Khan disposed of a petition jointly field by two of the candidates for the posts of Class-IV employees, claiming that the said four persons were appointed on political grounds.
The bench directed the director general to conduct the inquiry and strictly proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
In its reply, the Employment Exchange Commission, Swat, also admitted that the names of the four respondents were included in the list provided to the department for the purpose of recruitment on the orders received from Chief Minister’s House.

Petitioners claim recruitments made on political grounds

“The record made available before this court would transpire that in the light of direction of this court given in writ petition No.754-M/ 2020, the official respondents called the petitioners for interview but did not consider them for appointment against the post of Class-IV, despite having higher qualification and instead issued appointment orders in favour of the private respondents,” the bench observed.
The bench observed that the manager of Employment Exchange had also admitted the fact in his comments as well as before the court on January 30, 2024, that names of the four private respondents had been included in the requisite list on the direction of the then chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The petitioners named Mohammad Abid and Ziaullah had requested the court to set aside the appointment of the four respondents and they might be appointed against the said posts as they were having higher qualification than the appointed respondents.
The petitioners’ counsel Sanaullah stated that his clients registered themselves with Employment Exchange, Swat, on January 21, 2020. He said that in response to demand of the director general mines and minerals on February 3, 2020, the manager of employment exchange submitted list of registered candidates on February 18.
He stated that subsequently the list submitted on February 18, 2020, which included the names of the petitioners, was changed and another list was furnished by the employment exchange wherein their names were deleted.
The counsel said that the petitioners then approached the high court against not calling them for test and interview. He added that in that petition, the court granted interim relief to them and directed that the petitioners should be called for interviews at their own cost and risk.
He argued that the inclusion of the petitioners in the interview turned out to be eyewash as persons having lesser qualification than they were appointed as Class-IV employees.
He contended that the appointment of the four respondents by the department was pre-planned and for benefitting them the list of candidates provided to the department was changed by the employment exchange.
The director general of mines and minerals opposed the contention of the petitioners and stated that they were called for interview in accordance with the order of the court.
In his comments, he said that the interviews were conducted by a departmental selection committee, which selected the most suitable candidates for the posts.

14,Rising Afghan artist determined to follow his dream,Subhan Latif wants to launch YouTube channel and get foreign scholarship,"PESHAWAR: The Pashto album of a teenage Afghan singer has received overwhelming response from music lovers and encouraged him to follow future goals he has set for himself to reclaim the past glory of music legacy.
The family of rising Afghan artist Subhan Latif shifted to Peshawar following Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in August, 2021. The teenage singer has recently has launched a Pashto album titled ‘a tribute to Ustad Khial Mohammad’ that received an overwhelming response of more than 40 million people for his velvety voice.
“The Afghan duo - Suhrab Latif and Subhan Latif -- sang oldies of the livening legend Khial Mohammad and broke record of Pashto music chart,” said Dr Rashid Ahmad Khan, the director of Angaaze Music Production at Bacha Khan Trust.
Subhan Latif recently performed at musical concert under the auspices of Angaaze Music Production (AMUP) where senior musicians, folk singers and local artists turned up. The event was organised with an objective to pay a tribute to ghazal maestro Khial Mohammad and also adore his classic Pashto music.

Subhan Latif wants to launch YouTube channel and get foreign scholarship

Message of peace and tolerance could be transmitted through musical diversity in a befitting manner as music had no boundary and it was an effective weapon to counter hatred in all its manifestations, said the rising vocalist. However, he sought financial assistance for trumpeting the cause of Pashto music.
Nazir Latif, the father of Subhan Latif, told this scribe that music had been in their veins for more than 200 years as he hailed from a classic Afghan music family and trained his two teenage sons Suhrab Latif and Subhan Latif in classical melodies.
The two brothers were in 7th grade in a Kabul school during the regime change but continued education with a private tutor alongside music training. They have learnt playing tabla, harmonium and basics of music including classical and modern music. The rising rock star belonged to fourth generation of renowned Ustad Nabi Gul associated with King Zahir Shah during 50s and 60s.
“I can sing Persian, Pashto, Urdu and English numbers but lack modern digital gadgets like laptop, smart phone, home studio and several other accessories. If get a foreign scholarship, I and my brother will conduct research on comparative study of classical and modern Afghan Pashto music,” said Subhan Latif.
He said that Ustad Khial Mohammad had always been his ideal because he had influenced several generations of folk artists and even set trends in light ghazal and folk singing. Subhan Latif has recently attracted millions of audience on social media following release of his album.
“Atif Aslam, Haroon Bacha, Justin Beiber and Gul Panra are my favourite singers. I wish we could do an album with rock star Nehal Naseem and do some Urdu remixes. I can play guitar, keyboard and almost all the traditional instruments. I feel more at ease with harmonium as I love Mehdi Hasan, Ghulam Ali and Shah Wali Afghan, who left an indelible mark on my mind,” said the artist.
About his future plans, he said that he and his brother planned their own YouTube channel ‘Aahang-i-Afghan’ through which diverse musical trends would be introduced provided they could get financial support.
“I want to launch YouTube channel, grab a foreign scholarship and get the relevant digital paraphernalia. Presently our family members live at a rented house in Peshawar feeling safer,” he said.

16,Activists laud efforts to preserve historical mosques in Swat,Highlight significance of Mahmood Ghaznavi Mosque,"SWAT: Cultural heritage activists and historians have commended efforts to preserve several historical mosques in Swat and highlighted the significance of the Mahmood Ghaznavi Mosque in Udigram, Swat, as the second oldest mosque in the country.
They said the region had a large number of historical sites and monuments from the Hindu, Buddhist, Greek, and early Muslim eras.
“The Mahmood Ghaznavi Mosque is the oldest mosque in the northern parts of Pakistan and the second oldest in the country. Recognising its historical value, we felt the urgent need for its conservation,” Swat-based cultural activist Usman Ulasyar told Dawn.
He appreciated the initiative to conserve the mosque.
Amjad Ali, a cultural activist in Swat, said protecting the past meant protecting one’s identity, and the heritage sites, including the oldest mosque in the region, were the identity of early Muslims here.

Highlight significance of Mahmood Ghaznavi Mosque

“Preserving Swat’s cultural heritage is not just about protecting buildings. It’s about safeguarding our identity, stories, and roots for future generations,” he said.
Cultural activists said Swat had a rich archeological and heritage history, with hundreds of sites still existing in different areas.
“Our heritage is a testament to the rich tapestry of our history and civilisations that have flourished here. By conserving it, we honour our past and pave the way for a more enlightened future,” said local heritage preservation advocate Ali Shah.
Dr Abdul Samad, the director of archaeology and museum in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, highlighted the significance of the Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi Mosque in Udigram and said it was one of the oldest mosques in northern Pakistan, dating back to 1044 AD.
He said the ongoing conservation and preservation efforts were led by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums and supported by the World Bank through the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Integrated Tourism Development Project.
“The Mehmood Ghaznavi Mosque in Udigram is a venerable monument in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, tracing its roots to 1044 AD. It holds immense historical and scenic value as an archaeological gem in the Swat Valley. The provincial government is committed to promoting religious tourism in KP and undertaking various conservation projects across the province,” he said.
He said those efforts not only focused on Buddhist, Hindu, and Sikh heritage sites but also covered four historical mosques, Pishmal, Kalam Mosque, Udigram Mosque, and Masjid Mohabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar.
Archeologists said the Mehmood Ghaznavi Mosque was built in the former Hindu royal capital of Udigram shortly after the defeat. Dating back to 1048–49 CE, the mosque was built on an early artificial terrace with remains of Gandharan masonry. It has a splendid design of old Muslim architecture.
They said the most striking aspects of the mosque were traces of 30-foot-high walls, a graveyard, common rooms, student rooms, and a water mill.
The residential area to the west of the mosque was already abandoned and was being used as a cemetery by the end of the 12th century. The mosque is about three kilometres from Udigram town on the main Barikot-Mingora Road in Swat. It was built with stones during the Ghaznavid period.
The mosque is an essential landmark in the archaeological treasure of Swat, dating back to the period of Mahmud or his grandson Mawdud (1041–1050 AD). In 1984, an inscription in Arabic engraved on a block of marble was found by chance on the hill’s northern slope that rises above the mosque.
The mosque is named after Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi, who is believed to have brought Islam to Swat in the 11th century. Historians said the mosque was proof of the advent of Islam in Swat and was a significant historical and archaeological site in the country.
