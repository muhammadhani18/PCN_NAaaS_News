0,"'Zardari has presidential immunity', NAB tells court in Thatta water supply case",Accountability court adjourns hearing till May 21,"The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) submitted a report to an accountability court on Monday informing it that President Asif Ali Zardari has presidential Immunity under Article 248 of the Constitution.
The court was hearing the Thatta water supply reference.
President Zardari’s counsel Arshad Tabriz informed the court that a plea regarding the immunity was filed earlier, and NAB was supposed to respond today.
The court adjourned the hearing on the case till May 21.

During the last hearing, Zardari’s counsel maintained that his client enjoyed presidential immunity, therefore, proceedings against him could not be carried out.
The court issued notice to NAB seeking its arguments on the matter and adjourned the hearing of the case till today.
The water supply reference pertains to the special initiative department allegedly illegally awarding the Thatta water supply scheme contract to a private contractor.
The accused in the case include former secretary Ejaz Ahmed Khan, Ali Akbar, Ejaz Memon, Ali Akbar Abro, Khawaja Abdul Ghani Majeed, Manahal Majeed, Abdul Nadeem Bhutto, and others.
In January 2023, an accountability court returned a corruption reference against Zardari after amendments to NAB law.
Zardari had earlier also invoked presidential immunity in the Park Lane reference case.
The Park Lane case accused Zardari of influencing relevant authorities during his tenure as the president – from 2008 to 2013 – to obtain loans for his front companies.
Zardari allegedly received a loan of Rs1.5 billion released for Parthenon Private Limited “with ill intention”, and the money was allegedly later transferred for his personal use through fake bank accounts.
The anti-graft buster accused him of causing a loss of Rs3.77 billion to the national exchequer.

1,"PTI calls by-polls a 'farce', announces countrywide protests",Gohar asks ECP to put the brakes on notifications for those who won through underhanded means," 
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has declared its intention to stage nationwide protests, denouncing what it describes as flagrant and shamelessly rigged by-elections. The party demands that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) halt notifications for those declared winners through deceitful methods, asserting that the by-polls were a mockery of democracy.
In a news conference flanked by PTI Secretary General and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, as well as Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan lamented that instead of serving as a means of holding the government accountable, the by-elections in Punjab turned into a dark and disgraceful episode for democracy.
He further accused the alleged ""mandate thieves"" of resorting to shameful tactics to manipulate the electoral process, including stuffing ballot boxes before voting even began and coercing people as well as officials to rig the by-polls in the presence of ECP representatives.
Such actions, he argued, were unheard of, even in the darkest days of dictatorship.

The PTI chairman revealed that he and Omar Ayub visited various polling stations and witnessed flagrant rigging firsthand. He said that they promptly informed the electoral watchdog about the rigging incidents in Gujarat.
However, despite 24 hours having elapsed, no action has been taken, which raised many eyebrows. He lamented that “the constitution, democracy, and rule of law were virtually suspended in the country.”
Gohar recalled following the widespread electoral fraud in the general elections, the party had demanded that returning officers be selected from the judiciary rather than the administration. However, the ECP rejected the fair request.
He pointed out that the inspector general of Punjab shared equal responsibility for the electoral fraud, adding that the party was scrutinizing the performance of the polls supervisory body, which had failed miserably to uphold transparent and fair elections.
Gohar urged the ECP not to endorse those who fraudulently secured victories in the by-polls.
The PTI chairman said that the party had brought up the issue with both the Supreme Court and the electoral watchdog during the general elections. He asserted that the party should be informed about the measures taken thus far to tackle election rigging.
He revealed that the party’s polling agents were expelled from polling stations by the police, acting under the authority of the Punjab government. Consequently, he asserted that they were complicit in the election rigging.' Taxpayers' money squandered'
Speaking on the occasion, Omar Ayub asserted that Sunday's by-elections could hardly be deemed as an election, but rather a futile exercise squandering taxpayers' money.
He bemoaned that internet services were suspended 24 hours before the polls to prevent pre-election rigging. He criticized the government for lacking the courage to conduct free, fair, and transparent elections.
He said that ballot boxes were unlawfully filled at several polling stations early in the morning, with video evidence supporting this claim.
He said that the returning officer in Bajaur wrote a letter detailing the threats, coercion, and harassment he endured from intelligence agencies to manipulate the polls, which was unfortunate.
The PTI secretary-general called for an investigation into both letters authored by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the returning officer in Bajaur, addressing the alleged interference of agencies in both the judicial and electoral processes.
“I call on the heads of all intelligence agencies, working in Pakistan, to probe into the allegations leveled against their respective agencies and apologize to the nation for interfering in the elections and judicial affairs surfacing the letters of the six judges of IHC and the RO Bajaur.”
He vowed that they would raise these points on the floor of the house emphatically and would not rest until take the issue to its logical ends.
Omar disclosed that Punjab police detained and subjected a cameraman and reporter from two private news channels to brutal torture. He recounted that when they confronted the police, they were informed that the journalists were not apprehended by police but by agency officials disguised in police uniforms.
Omar continued, condemning the Punjab police for their excessive brutality and disregard for the law. He recounted how they were obstructed by the police for three hours, with senior officers claiming they were powerless due to orders from higher authorities forbidding Omar and Barrister Gohar's passage.
He lamented the prevailing lawlessness and jungle rule in the country, where only the commands of the “jungle king” were heeded.
Omar announced that the opposition coalition, named 'Tehreek-e-Tahaffuz-e-Aain' or the Movement for Protection of the Constitution, would convene its public gatherings in Faisalabad, with the subsequent rally scheduled for Karachi on May 5.
Following this, a sequence of public meetings would take place in North and Central Punjab, along with gatherings in inner Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
The opposition leader pledged that the protest movement would persist until the supremacy of the constitution and the enforcement of the rule of law are ensured throughout the country.
He declared that a large-scale protest demonstration would take place nationwide on Friday, denouncing the alleged widespread rigging in the elections. The event would see participation from all the party's representatives in the national and provincial assemblies, as well as ticket holders. Hamid Raza, speaking at the event, asserted that labeling Sunday's by-polls as an election would be an insult to the electoral process. He alleged that results were extracted from the returning officers under duress, with presiding officers being bribed at the Governor's House. Those who resisted faced severe torture and were coerced into signing Form-45.
Raza revealed the existence of a video recorded at the Governor's House, wherein money was distributed in exchange for votes, a practice he deemed both shameful and repugnant.
He criticized the ECP, alleging that once again, it demonstrated its complicity in safeguarding those who steal mandates, ensuring their triumph.
Hamid Raza asserted that mere condemnation of the flagrant election theft would not be enough and therefore, an FIR under Article 6 should be lodged against both the ECP and the Punjab government. He stressed that such blatant disregard for the Pakistani constitution had never been witnessed before in history.
""We utterly reject this election and its outcomes,"" he added.
He emphasized that the opposition alliance, operating under the movement’s banner, would convene its historic public meeting in Faisalabad. This gathering marks the beginning of a prolonged protest movement in Punjab, all while adhering to constitutional and legal boundaries.
He denounced the Punjab police for its extreme brutality and authoritarianism, purportedly under the guidance of the IG Punjab. He cautioned that they would no longer tolerate such tyranny.
He affirmed his unwavering support for PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, asserting that he was following his directives closely. He vowed to persist with the protest movement until the stolen mandate was reclaimed.

2,PTI slams ECP for dropping the ball on by-polls,Gohar berates ECP for failing to ensure transparency as rigging allegations cast shadow over polling," 
By-elections held in 21 national and provincial assembly constituencies across Pakistan wrapped up amid incidents of violence, allegations of electoral irregularities, and reports of rigging casting a shadow over the proceedings.
While most polling stations managed to keep the peace, a handful of scuffles and even a fatality put a dent in an otherwise peaceful electoral affair, all against the backdrop of a suspension of cellular services.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali vehemently criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for mishandling the process, accusing it of dropping the ball when it came to ensuring transparency.
Speaking at the Khattala Polling Station in Gujrat’s PP-32 constituency, he accused the ECP of failing to ensure transparency.
Gohar described the by-elections as a sham, arguing that they failed to represent the true voice of the people. He declared that the PTI would not accept the results of the PP-32 by-elections.
Discussing inquiries regarding ex-prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, Gohar Ali implied that attempts to distance the former premier from the public would fail, expressing hope for his prompt release. He also highlighted that Imran received three distinct sentences within just five days, alleging undue judicial pressure.
In a social media post shared on X, PTI pointed out gross violations of the election code of conduct at PP-36 Wazirabad’s Polling Station No. 1. The party alleged that the ruling alliance in connivance with the police force was involved in mass-scale rigging.
The party claimed a new episode, similar to that of the Feb 8 election rigging, was being repeated on Sunday.
Further accusations of electoral misconduct emerged from PTI's central Punjab acting president and general secretary, Hammad Azhar, who highlighted irregularities and rigging attempts in the by-elections. Azhar shared a video on social media showing entire booklets of fake ballot papers, raising serious questions about the electoral process's integrity.
He urged party workers to post results from Form-45 on social media, expose irregularities and stage peaceful protests.
Violence and unrest also marred the by-elections, with reports of clashes and fatalities in various locations. In Narowal’s PP-54, a 60-year-old Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) worker, Muhammad Yousaf, died following a violent altercation between PML-N and PTI supporters.
The clash began at Kot Najo village and escalated, leading to Yousaf being struck with a stick. Despite attempts to rush him to medical care, he died before reaching the hospital.
In another incident, violence and rigging allegations disrupted the by-election process. In Lahore's PP-149 constituency, a presiding officer at a polling station admitted to obtaining premature signatures on Form-45 from polling agents before the voting concluded, citing it as a time-saving measure.This led to a confrontation with supporters of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), resulting in a sit-in protest at the polling station. Further violence erupted at the government primary school in Ferozawala, where PML-N and SIC workers clashed, causing a suspension of polling.
The ECP later announced that additional police personnel were deployed to restore order, allowing voting to resume.
Police involvement in some incidents also raised concerns.
PTI's former MPA Shabbir Gujjar was arrested during the by-election in Lahore's PP-164 constituency, with authorities citing protective reasons. However, a spokesperson for Gujjar claimed that there were no known cases or conflicts involving the PTI leader, suggesting that his arrest was unjustified.

3,PML-N’s win in by-polls symbol of ‘people’s trust’,PM Shehbaz vows to uphold public’s confidence in govt,"The PML-N on Sunday described its victory in the by-elections as a manifestation of the people’s trust in the public-friendly policies of the government and a clear rejection of the narrative of falsehood crafted by the PTI leadership from behind bars.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the newly elected members of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures in the by-polls.
In a statement, the premier said the victory of the newly elected members of the PML-N in the by-elections was a manifestation of the people's confidence in the party.
He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the people who had voted for the PML-N in the by-elections.
“We assure the people that they we will not leave any stone unturned in their service. We will try to fulfill their faith in us with full honesty and hard work,” he added.
PM Shehbaz observed that along with the visible signs of economic improvement, the change in public opinion was also becoming noticeable.
“The success of the PML-N candidates is a public acknowledgment of the government's service in restoring the economy, reducing inflation, and improving foreign relations,” he added.
He continued that with economic improvement and increase in relief for the people, public opinion would further change in the future.
The premier noted that forecasts of economic improvement by international financial institutions, news agencies and surveys also had a positive impact on public opinion.
He added that the negative political behaviour of the opposition after February 8 this year – the day of the general elections -- had also left its supporters and the people confused and disappointed, apparently referring to the PTI.
The premier noted that losing and winning was part of the electoral process and it was a democratic attitude to adopt the path of political cooperation instead of hurling accusations.
“Flaws and objections in the electoral process can only be removed through mutual cooperation and political dialogue.”
In a video message, Federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar said the preliminary results of the by-polls had validated the fact that the people of Pakistan firmly believed in the leadership of the PML-N.
“They fully welcome the people-friendly policies of its government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif,” he added.
He said the economic reforms implemented by PM Shehbaz as well as his team had given a hope to the people, who had shown their trust in the government by voting for the PML-N.
The minister credited his party for kicking off the journey of economic stability in the country by curbing inflation and increasing foreign reserves.
Tarar said the people had rejected the “false” and “misleading” narrative of the PTI, whose leadership was allegedly conspiring against the country from behind the bars to achieve its ulterior motives.
“[The PTI leadership is] issuing statements from prison that seriously damages the credibility of Pakistan at the international level,” he added.
“The ‘anti-state narrative’ is further pushed through these false statements.”
The minister maintained that the people had rejected the PTI founding chairman Imran Khan’s “politics of hatred, chaos, division, falsehood and hypocrisy”.
He continued that the performance of the PML-N governments in the Centre and in Punjab spoke volumes and had truly manifested in the form of the results of the by-polls.
“The PML-N stood victorious in most of the by-polls today,” the minister said, vowing that the government was aggressively taking measures to restore the stature of the country at the international level and provide relief to the people by stabilising the economy.
He paid tribute to the people for standing by the “truth” and burying the narrative of “falsehood”.
He expressed his gratitude to the Almighty for the PML-N’s success in the by-polls.
Earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said the PTI’s “bullying” would not be tolerated in any case, adding that the “murderers” of PML-N activist Muhammad Yousaf, who was killed in Narowal, had been arrested.
In a statement, CM Maryam offered her condolences to the family of the slain PML-N activist.
She said turning politics into hatred and personal enmity was a major challenge for the society.
“Politics means service and reforms, not violence and intolerance.”
Earlier in the day, Yousaf, a 60-year-old PML-N activist, was killed during a clash with PTI activists in Kot Najo village of Narowal during the by-election for its constituency PP-54.
The federal information minister in a news statement also condoled with the PML-N activist’s bereaved family and condemned the PTI for the tragedy.
Tarar regretted that the PTI had resorted to violence and killing for winning the by-polls through rigging.
“Muhammad Yousaf’s sacrifice will not go in vain,” he added, vowing to bring his killers to justice.
Tarar also prayed to the Almighty to grant Yousaf’s departed soul eternal peace as well as courage to his bereaved family to bear the irreparable loss.

4,"Pakistan, Iran to wage joint fight against terrorism",The two sides also discuss the long-delayed Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project,"Pakistan and Iran agreed to strengthen bilateral economic and security cooperation by setting a $10 billion trade target and jointly fighting the menace of terrorism, as Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi began his three-day tour of the country on Monday.
President Raisi was accorded a warm welcome upon arrival in Islamabad. He spent his first day of the visit in meetings with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari, and Army Chief Gen Asim Munir. The Senate chairman and the Nationals Assembly speaker also called on the visiting president.
During the formal talks at the Prime Minister's House, the two sides discussed a wide range of issues covering bilateral ties as well as regional and international issues. Following their talks, the two leaders also spoke at a joint press conference.
Raisi traveled to Islamabad three months after the two countries were on the verge of a major conflict after Iran launched missile strikes inside the country in January. Pakistan retaliated with similar strikes two days later. However, the situation was quickly brought under control as Iran dispatched its top diplomat to Islamabad.

Since then the two countries have been making efforts to bury that bad patch in their bilateral ties. The fact the Iranian president traveled to Islamabad despite simmering tensions with Israel suggests the importance Tehran attaches to its ties with Pakistan, according to officials.
The warm reception being given to the Iranian president by Pakistan also indicated keenness on the part of Islamabad to get over January’s tit-for-tat missile strikes. At a joint news conference, the two leaders reaffirmed their commitments to expanding wide-ranging bilateral cooperation.
Both sides admitted that the current volume of the bilateral trade was not acceptable. They agreed to increase it to $10 billion from the current volume of around $2 billion. They vowed to expand the bilateral cooperation in areas of trade, energy, connectivity, and people-to-people contacts.
 
Against the backdrop of the recent tensions, border security and the issue of terrorism were some of the major talking points. Shehbaz underlined that terrorism was a common threat and both sides needed to fight it collectively. Raisi hoped his visit would prove a “turning point” in the bilateral ties.
Both the leaders expressed deep concern at the situation in Gaza and called for international efforts for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, lifting of the siege, and provision of humanitarian relief to the people of Gaza.
Prime Minister Shehbaz lauded the stance taken by Iran against Israel. He also appreciated the Iranian leadership on Iran’s unequivocal and principled support for the Kashmiri people and their legitimate rights.

In remarks, Raisi said that the killings by Israel in Gaza were being committed with the support of the United States and other Western countries. He criticized the international organizations, including the United Nations, saying: “They say they support human rights, but they proved that they are inefficient.”
The two sides also discussed the long-delayed Iran-Pakistan (IP) Gas Pipeline project. The multibillion-dollar gas project was supposed to be completed in December 2014. Pakistan, however, could not initiate the work on its side of the border, fearing US economic sanctions.
Recently, nevertheless, authorities in Pakistan decided to start the work on the project. In the first phase, Pakistan would build a pipeline from Gwadar to the Iranian border. The US had voiced its concerns and warned that the Pakistani move could trigger potential economic sanctions.

Officials said that Iran was aware of Pakistan’s compulsions and during their talks; the two leaders discussed the possible alternative options to avoid US sanctions. They added that Iran was ready to help Pakistan find ways and means to complete the project.
The two leaders also signed eight cooperation agreements, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
Raisi is accompanied by his spouse and a high-level delegation. He plans to visit Karachi, the country’s biggest city, and Lahore, where he will meet with the country’s recently elected first female chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif.
The visit comes after Iran’s airstrike into Israel, which was in response to an Israeli strike in Syria that had killed two Iranian generals in a consular building.
