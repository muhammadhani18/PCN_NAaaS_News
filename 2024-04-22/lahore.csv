Opposition alleges ‘massive rigging’in PP-32, PP-36

Opposition parties, including Jamaat-i-Islami and Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan candidates as well, criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan ECP, returning officer, local police and administration for their failure to hold transparent election.
The Kathala polling station remained the focus of all contesting parties after reports of rigging and entry denial to voters, particularly women.

The supporters of rival parties also clashed at the polling station after reports of rigging inside.
 






Speaking to media, Qaisara Elahi said that she could never expect such a shameful act of rigging by her own brother. PTI leader Sumaira Elahi Chohan, the youngest sister of Q chief, also reached a polling station after reports of rigging.
On being inquired by her, the presiding officer (in a video clip) said a group of men had forcibly snatched hundreds of ballot papers and put them into ballot boxes after stamping them. He said police had been informed to arrest the culprits.
 






The Punjab JI chief Dr Tariq Saleem and Gujrat district emir Ansar Mehmood Dhool said police and local authorities had completely facilitated the PML-Q aspirant throughout the campaign and polling.

2,"PML-N, PTI workers clash at dozens of polling stations in Narowal",Sixty-year-old person dies after being struck on the head with a stick.,"NAROWAL: During the by-elections for PP 54 in Narowal on Sunday, one person died after being struck on the head with a stick in election-related violence. Clashes were reported between the workers of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) at over two dozen polling stations.
The PML-N had fielded Ahmed Iqbal for the by-poll while Owais Qasim was backed by the Sunni Ittehad Council-PTI.
According to unofficial results of PP-54 by-poll, PML-N’s Iqbal won the seat with 60,351 votes, while PTI’s Awais Qasim stood runner-up with 46,686 votes.
Tensions triggered when disputes arose over alleged fake voting at polling stations in Village Jibal, Langrake, and Bahuwali, resulting in the suspension of the polling process.
In Village Rajian, party workers attacked each other with chemical sprays, slaps and punches. Police arrived at the polling station in Kotnaju following reports of violence and clashes outside the polling station. During physical brawl, 60-year-old Muhammad Yusuf succumbed to injuries sustained from a blow to his head with a stick.
Federal Minister for Planning and Development and General Secretary of PML-N Ahsan Iqbal condemned what he termed as PTI’s hooliganism, vowing justice for Yusuf, whom he described as a peace advocate.
 






Ahmed Iqbal, PML-N candidate, claimed that Yusuf was a party worker and targeted by PTI-affiliated workers. He said the perpetrators would be held accountable.
According to Muhammad Ashfaq, Zafarwal police inspector, they received a call on the helpline from Naseem Murtaza, reporting a seriously injured perosn arriving at Durman Town hospital during the altercation. Upon investigation, they found that the injured person had succumbed to their injuries.
Contrary to political claims, Mohammad Babar, a resident of Kotnajo, said that the incident was not politically motivated. He said that villagers were involved in typical village brawl, where Yusuf attempted to mediate and was hit in the head.
The police said they had taken three people into custody, although no formal FIR has been lodged yet pending a request from the deceased’s family.Malik Muhammad Khalil, deputy superintendent of police headquarters of Narowal, said that Muhammad Yusuf was killed by a stick on his head during a fight outside the Kotnaju polling station. He said that the police have arrested the accused involved in the incident.
Efforts to obtain comment from DPO Mohammad Naveed Malik and Deputy Commissioner Syed Hasan Raza (also returning officer) remained unanswered at the time of reporting.

3,Excise dept writes to 26 banks to pay vehicles token tax,"Warns of 100pc fine, cancellation of registration, confiscation","LAHORE: The Punjab Excise and Taxation Department has issued a letter to the presidents of 26 banks to show displeasure for not paying token taxes of 18,750 vehicles and warned of strict legal action for any further delay. 
The letter was issued to intensify the campaign for collection of vehicle taxes from the defaulters. 
Excise Lahore Director Muhammad Asif confirmed to Dawn that the department had dispatched letters to the presidents of 26 prominent banks, suggesting them to pay token taxes on the leased vehicles. He said the action was initiated following the reports that the number of vehicles leased out by the 26 banks had reached 18,750. 
Of them, most vehicles, 5,022, belonged to the Habib Bank, followed by 2,523 of the Bank of Punjab and 2,211 of the Bank Alfalah. 
He said the department had shown its grave concern at the banks’ failure to fulfill their responsibility in ensuring timely token tax payments. 

Warns of 100pc fine, cancellation of registration, confiscation

Despite collecting monthly installments, often with interest, on these leased vehicles, the banks have purportedly neglected to remit the requisite token taxes or prompt borrowers to do so, Mr Asif said.  He declared it a final warning issued by the excise department to the banks, highlighting the imminent legal consequences in case of non-compliance. 
Notably, repeated notices have been issued prior to this, urging the banks to fulfill their tax obligations without delay. The excise department has also warned of cancelling registration of the delinquent vehicles and imposing a 100pc fine. 
Moreover, legal measures, including the potential confiscation of bank property, loom large as punitive action against non-compliant banks were also intimated through the letter. A grace period of 14 days has been granted for the settlement of token taxes.

4,Probe after ex-Navy officer cries foul in non-custom paid cars case,Alleges son illegally detained in fabricated case; police claim youngster was a member of gang including govt officers.,"LAHORE: Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman has issued an order for the launch of an ‘internal inquiry’ after a retired Navy captain alleged that the Lahore police had detained his young son illegally for 10 days.
On the other hand, police claimed that the boy was a member of a gang involved in the illegal business of luxury non-custom-paid vehicles.
The inquiry was launched following the police reports that a group of people, including some serving officers of the Punjab Excise and Taxation Department, were involved in the business of luxury non-custom paid cars.
Identified as Sheharyar Ahmad, the youngster, a student of BBA, was released on the order of the Lahore High Court when his father Ammad Hassan, a retired captain of the Pakistan Navy, filed a writ petition. He alleged, in the petition, that his son was taken into custody by police in a raid on his house in Cantt after registration of a fake/forged robbery case.
“It has been observed that he was shown as arrested in a case lodged on Dec 25, 2022 under section 392 of the PPC at Police Station Chuhng following an incident reported on Dec 24, 2022 against unknown accused,” reads the LHC order.

Alleges son illegally detained in fabricated case; police claim youngster was a member of gang including govt officers

The LHC judge declared that during that period, police had neither submitted an interim report before the court nor resorted to file an untraced report because no accused was ever arrested in this case.
The high court ordered SP Saddar Division Sydrah Khan to conduct a detailed inquiry into the matter and submit a report with the court. However, the police inquiry finalised on the court order declared Sheharyar guilty.
Special Protection Unit (SPU) DIG Imran Kishwar told Dawn the findings of the inquiry conducted by SP Sydrah Khan had been submitted with the LHC. He alleged that Sheharyar was one of the key players of the network behind the sale and purchase of illegal non-custom paid luxury cars.
“During the inquiry many more stunning revelations have been made as it has been suspected that the number of non-custom paid vehicles sold so far may be over 100,” the DIG said. He added that it was an organised gang, including the Punjab Excise and Taxation Department officials, who were behind the illegal sale and purchase of non-custom paid cars. A data entry operator of the department was also among them besides some other senior officers, he said.
About BBA student Sheharyar’s involvement in the robbery case as was alleged by his father, Mr Kishwar said inquiries were also being conducted in this respect. He said police had launched action against Sheharyar when he mediated a deal of a non-custom paid car, which was purchased by another Pakistani student in the USA.
The USA student had deposited an amount Rs50m in a bank through a ‘pay order’ and presented some documents as evidence, he said. After this, police had expanded the scope of investigation to detect and trace other members of the network, the DIG SPU said, adding that 25 luxury non-paid custom vehicles had been traced so far.
“The USA student is still struggling to get his payment back,” Imran Kishwar said.
To a question, he confirmed that a high level internal inquiry had also been initiated on the directions of the chief secretary to further expand the scope of the investigations when it appeared that some excise and taxation department officers were also a part of the gang. On the other hand, Ammad Hassan told Dawn that police had arrested his son in a fake case at the behest of PML-N political leader Chaudhry Iqbal Gujjar.
DIG Kishwar denied the allegation of Hassan that police had arrested him at the behest of PML-N leader Chaudhry Iqbal Gujjar. He claimed that during the inquiry it appeared that Gujjar’s son was also one of the affectees whom the non-custom paid car was sold. Hassan said his son had just facilitated Gujjar’s son in the purchase of a luxury vehicle being his friend some two years back and the vehicle later was reported to be non-custom paid.
“My son Sheharyar had nothing to do with the business of non-custom paid vehicles as he was just assisting Chaudhry Iqbal’s son being his close friend,” Ammad Hassan stressed.
He added that as Chaudhry Iqbal Gujjar was having connections with the PML-N rulers in Punjab, he used his influence in the police department to involve Sheharyar in the fabricated case.
Ammad alleged that the CIA police tortured his son in the presence of the PML-N leader’s son during custody. About the inquiry report of SP Sydrah Khan, he said he had not been informed about its findings or that it had been submitted to the court.

5,Central Punjab PTI leadership to protest rigging in by-elections,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Central Punjab, has decided to strongly protest against the massive...","LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Central Punjab, has decided to strongly protest against the massive rigging and fascism unleashed by the police during the by-election of 2024 on Sunday.
The PTI alleges that the incumbent government has engaged in massive rigging in all by-elections, particularly in Gujrat, and has broken all previous records of rigging.
PTI Central Punjab Acting President Hammad Azhar has urged Lahorites to come out against the massive rigging and stage peaceful sit-ins in front of the returning officers’ offices of NA-119 and PP-149 (outside UET); and the RO office of PP-164 at Kahna, Ferozepur Road. He has also suggested organising a sit-in at Regal Chowk (PP-147) and Baidian Road (PP-158).
Mr Azhar stated in a tweet on X, that the February 8 general elections stood as the most rigged and manipulated election in history to date. However, he stated, the April 21 by-election has broken that record with ballot stuffing, pre-signed statements of counts (Form 45), and unlawful arrests. 
“This is a shameful mockery of the democratic process,” he commented.
The PTI leader also expressed grave concern over the torture of polling agents.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja tweeted that the presence of candidates and election agents at the office of the ROs during consolidation has been barred everywhere. 
“This is part of the rigging plan along with the shutdown of the internet. This has set the scene for the use of pre-signed and fictitiously filled-up forms 45,” he added.
Posting a handwritten request from a presiding officer of a polling station for PP-158 (Lahore) by-election, PTI leader Moonis Elahi, who is contesting from this constituency, stated that the presiding officer did not carry Form-45 and she informed the returning officer of the PP-158 by-election. Mr Elahi also posted several videos explaining the scale of rigging unleashed by the establishment.

6,PUNJAB NOTES: Punjab Police: humiliate and get humiliated,Why is it so that whenever Punjab police are humiliated for reasons right or wrong people feel elated? Why do they...,"Why is it so that whenever Punjab police are humiliated for reasons right or wrong people feel elated? Why do they celebrate it as something that falls in the category of natural justice, as something that they want to see happen? But it usually comes their way as a serendipitous gift? It only happens once in a blue moon, literally out of nowhere. The reason is fathomable if one cares to know.  
Colonialism sired Punjab police in the mid-19th century. Like a true son they carry all the frightful and ugly features of their father; brutality and corruption. Colonialism actively worked at least at three levels; economic, political and socio-cultural. At economic level it was highly extractive as it forcibly appropriated most of the surplus produced by the colonised people. They did it through the laws they introduced to their advantage. It legalised plunder in the name of rule of law. In order to ensure strict compliance from the indigenous people it created new departments of the government which gave them carte blanche to use force and coercion when and where needed. At times force was used just to display who was the master.  
At political level, colonialism created segments in upper and middle classes that would be loyal to the foreign ruling elite. This was usually done using the carrot and stick approach. People were forced to provide the both; the carrot and the stick. The carrot was the indigenous resources which were used to buy the loyalty of important sections of the colonised. Allotment of land and appointment to high offices did the trick. The stick was the newly put in place structure of the state for the ‘people’s welfare’ that had at its command forces to suppress and eliminate all those who resisted and defied the occupation.  
At socio-cultural level, the way of life of the foreign masters was effectively projected as a mark of a civilised society that relied more on rationality and scientific inquiry than humaneness. So the ideal was not freedom from the imposed order but to ape and emulate the enforcers of the order. 
To maintain the status quo the colonial state evolved two crucial departments along with others, namely army and police. Army for the border security and crushing internal rebellion if and when it happened. And police for law and order. Army was raised theoretically, at least, from all regions while police were generally region specific. So were the Punjab police as the very name indicates. Without going into what is written in the documents, it’s very obvious that police were raised with the objective of controlling the local people. They were trained to terrorise the people into submission which they gladly did and still do. The police built under the Raj was the polar opposite of the UK police. The fundamental difference was that in the UK police dealt with citizens and here it dealt with subjects. Subjects under foreign rule had to be treated like slaves. They had to be reminded of their status to make them compliant. In order to put them in their place the police were given the licence to be brutal in their dealings with the subjects. Their brutality displayed itself in the acts of humiliating and torturing the subjects. Not only the vestiges of this colonial practice are still there but the practice itself is also intact in the post-colonial era. Even the lowest member of Punjab police is in the habit of addressing an ordinary person, who is legally a citizen, with unbearable rudeness. If he talks back, he would be honoured with unrepeatable names. Hurtful talk laced with expletives is meant to humiliate the citizens. A policeman is not there to serve the citizenry but to lord over it. Even the apparently cultured police officer wouldn’t use a word like sir while addressing a citizen. Rather citizens are expected to address policemen as ‘janab, janabe aali (your highness)’ which no member of police force deserves. If you go to a police station you will not be offered a chair or something to sit on. You have to stand and abjectly mumble your request which will not be given serious attention. You have to bribe the staff at the station to get your complaint lodged. If they arrest someone and bring them to police station they are surely going to humiliate them first and torture later, with impunity of course. It’s routine that can be observed 24/7.  
Our policeman is like a character in one of the Brecht’s poems who announces: “…What my gun says is my opinion / and that of the whole lot I’ll spare only my brother/ by just kicking him in the teeth.” But hold on. There are certain type of persons who are received with respect. They are the vestiges of the lot created by colonial apparatus who acted as informers and go-betweens with the Raj administration. They were/ are allowed to settle people’s matters which involve the police and charge people their ‘fee’ part of which goes to the police and the rest is pocketed by them. There is another group higher in status that doesn’t frequent police stations but police visit their outhouses and farmhouses to pay their salutations. They are politicians. Police and politicians have been/ are organically linked. That’s why every politician in power insists on having a police officer of his choice in his area; he does his bidding by framing his opponents in false cases and favouring or disfavouring people, innocent and involved in cases, at his recommendation.  
Such a historical situation provides a backdrop for the people’s vicarious pleasure when police are humiliated by other organs of the state or non-state actors such as rural gangs and urban mafias. As to the efficiency of the Punjab Police in matters of law and order, they continue with the novel ways invented in colonial days.  
Hardened criminals and perpetrators of heinous crimes are routinely eliminated in so-called police encounters in which only criminals get killed, not members of the force. Press is given the handout after each encounter. The text has remained the same since mid-19th century: “some accomplices of the accused opened fire on the police escorting the accused and he died because of their fire.” As to the ordinary crimes, they are hardly registered.  
In a nutshell, Punjab Police are what they were in the colonial era; they treat the people who pay for their pay and privileges as enemies. That’s why when the incident of their humiliation occurs it gets the biggest laugh.  — soofi01@hotmail.com

During his stay at the Chief Justice’s Rest House in the GOR-1 from April 15 to 19, the CJP noted that the entry into the area was restricted and no one could enter there without security checks, but still 
guardrooms were illegally constructed outside several residences.
“If a guard is required, he should be within the premises of the residence of the person to be guarded,” he said. 
The concerns expressed by the CJP were conveyed to the Punjab chief secretary by Supreme Court registrar through a letter. The registrar said that the unnecessary wasteful expenditure on construction of walls around each residence in the GOR also concerned the CJP.
“Is it justifiable to spend public resources on walls within the secured GOR,?” the registrar asked on behalf of CJP Isa. He also asked why the earlier practice of installing fences had been discarded?
Seeking Punjab chief secretary’s response, the registrar has also sought the rules and regulation regarding the buildings and construction, including walls, within the GOR.
Meanwhile, in a prompt response, the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD) has written a letter to the Lahore High Court (LHC) registrar, seeking removal of the guardrooms/checkposts constructed outside 17 residences of the LHC judges in the GOR-I.
A letter written by theGOR-1 property manager says the CJP, during his recent stay in the GOR, noted with concern that despite restricted entry into the area, guardrooms in the open green areas have been illegally constructed outside the premises of some residences.
The S&GAD requested the LHC registrar to make necessary arrangements for removal of the guardrooms/checkposts or to move these structures inside the residences of 17 LHC judges.
The 17 GOR-1 residences occupied by the LHC judges, which also have guardrooms/checkposts on open green areas are: 19-Aikman Road; 1-A, 1-B, 2, 4, 10 and 12 Tollinton Road; 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 Tollinton Lane; 8-B, 12-B, 14-B and 15-B Golf Road; and 1-D Club Road.
Sources in the S&GAD say there are also several other residences, occupied by bureaucrats and ministers, having guardrooms on open green areas, adding that those residing in these houses would also be instructed to remove these illegal structures at the earliest.
