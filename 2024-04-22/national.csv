ALLAMA Iqbal’s two Persian masnavis, or kind of long poems, Asraar-i-Khudi (1915) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (1918), were later on published in one volume (1923) and are often jointly referred to as Asraar-o-Rumooz.
Both Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi sparked great interest among the poetry buffs and scholars alike. Aside from a controversy that lasted for quite long, both the masnavis were well-received and translated into several languages. Here is a brief intro to the translated versions.
According to Rafiuddin Hashmi, Iqbal’s Urdu and Persian works have been translated into 41 different languages of the world. Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi, too, were rendered into many languages, wholly or partially. But here we would list only the complete translations:
English: Prof Reynold A. Nicholson (1868-1945), a renowned English scholar of Islamic mysticism and Islamic literature, translated Asraar-i-Khudi in 1920, titled The Secrets of the Self. Interestingly, Allama Iqbal pointed out many errors or misconceptions and corrected the translation. Nicholson accepted the corrections, except for a few. The second revised edition was published in 1940 and many editions of the corrected version appeared from Lahore. Saeed Akhter Durrani discovered the original copy that had Iqbal’s corrections and its facsimile was published by University of Karachi in 2001.
Prof A. J. Arberry, another renowned orientalist, translated Rumooz-i-Bekhudi under the title The Mysteries of Selflessness. It was published from London in 1953. Other English translations include the ones by Abdur Rahman Tariq and Maqbool Ilahi.
Arabic: Aside from other works by Iqbal, Abdul Wahab Azzaam published versified Arabic translation of Asraar-o-Rumooz from Cairo in 1956. Sameer Abdul Hameed Ibrahim published its another Arabic translation from Cairo in 2005.
Bengali: Syed Abdul Mannan translated Asraar-i-Khudi into Bengali, published from Dhaka in 1940. Mirza Sultan Ahmed translated Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi and separately published them from Dhaka in 1954.

Chinese: Liu Shuxiong rendered Asraar-i-Khudi into Chinese and it was published from Peking (now Beijing) in 1999.
French: Jamshed Murtazvi and Meyerovitch translated Asraar-o-Rumooz into French and it appeared from Paris in 1989.
Kashmiri: Ghulam Ahmed Kulgami translated Asraar-i-Khudi into his native Kashmiri and it was published from Karachi in 1969.
Malayalam: Abdul Qadir translated Asraar-i-Khudi into Malayalam and Cochin’s Iqbal Library published it in 1941.
Pashto: Samandar Khan Samandar translated Asraar-i-Khudi (1954) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (1952) into Pashto and both were published from Karachi.
Punjabi: Ahmed Husain Qureshi Qaladari rendered Asraar-i-Khudi into Punjabi and in 1976 Lahore’s Meri Library published it. A year earlier, Khalil Aatish had translated Asraar-o-Rumooz into Punjabi and Sang-i-Meel was the publisher.
Sindhi: Lutfullah Badvi rendered Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi, separately, into Sindhi and both were published in 1956 from Karachi. Muhammad Baksh Vaasif, also translated Asraar-i-Khudi, and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi separately and both were published from Karachi (year not mentioned).
Turkish: Ali Nihad Tarlan rendered Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi, both were published from Istanbul in 1958. Ali Yuksel rendered Asraar-i-Khudi into Turkish and published it from Ankara in 1990.
Urdu: Aside from partial translations, complete translations into Urdu include the ones by: Dr Hamid Husain, Asraar-i-Khudi (Bhopal, 1978); Ahmed Isaar, Asraar-o-Rumooz (Bangalore, 2008); Asraar-i-Khudi, versified translation, Iqbal Husain Mehdi Rizvi (Muradabad, 1975); Khwaja Hameed Yazdani, Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Lahore, 1994); Justice S.A. Rahman, versified Urdu translation of Asraar-i-Khudi, (Lahore, 1967); Ismat Javed versified translation of Asraar-i-Khudi (Delhi, 1991) and versified translation of Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Delhi, 1998); Ghulam Dastgeer Shahab, Asraar-i-Khudi (Poona, 1989) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Poona, 1991); Abdur Rasheeed Faazil, versified translation of both Asraar-i-Khudi (Karachi, 1956) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Karachi 1984); Mehr Taqvi Jaipuri, versified translation of Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Hyderabad, Sindh, 1962).
Recently, a translation of Asraar-o-Rumooz has been published from Lahore. Though published earlier, this new edition has been recomposed and elegantly produced. The translator has used easy to understand Urdu and the meanings have been made quite clear. Its translator Mian Abdur Rasheed was a prominent scholar who translated several of Iqbal’s works and they include Urdu translations of: Armaghaan-i-Hijaz, Pas Che Bayad Kard Aye Aqvaame-i-Mashriq, Payam-i-Mashriq, Javed Nama, Zuboor-i-Ajam, Kulliyaat-i-Iqbal Farsi and Asraar-o-Rumooz. These books have run to several editions over a long period of time.
Mian Abdur Rasheed was born on Jan 1, 1915, in a village near Gujranwala, Punjab. Having passed his BA from Lahore in 1935, he worked as reporter at Punjab Legislative Assembly. Mian Abdur Rasheed wrote regular columns in Nawa-i-Waqt and Pakistan Times. He also broadcast a weekly programme from Radio Pakistan. Mian Abdur Rasheed died in September 1991.
Most of the info contained in this piece is derived from Kitabiyaat-i-Iqbal, a work by Prof Dr Rafiuddin Hashmi. Hashmi Sahib, considered Pakistan’s foremost expert on Iqbal, died on Jan 25, 2024, in Lahore. Though barely few newspapers reported his demise, a tribute to this great scholar of Iqbal Studies is well in order while remembering Iqbal on his death anniversary, which fell on April 21.

1,"ECP takes notice of irregularities, violence in by-polls","Seeks report on man’s death, signing of blank Form 45s in Punjab; Atta Tarar says ‘voters have rejected PTI’","ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has taken notice of irregularities and violence during the by-elections on 21 seats of national and provincial assemblies on Sunday, the electoral watchdog said in a statement.
According to an official press release, the ECP took action on the killing of a man near a polling station in Narowal constituency (PP-54) of Punjab Assembly.
Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja discussed the issue with the relevant police official and directed them to take action against the killers.
The commission also took notice of the reports that some presiding officers had forced polling agents to sign blank Form-45 in Punjab Assembly’s PP-149 constituency (Lahore-III).
According to a press release, the commission sought a report from the provincial election commissioner for further action.

Seeks report on man’s death, signing of blank Form 45s in Punjab; Atta Tarar says ‘voters have rejected PTI’

Form-45 carries the tally of total votes polled in favour of a candidate at a polling station. After the form is duly filled by the staff, it is signed by the polling agents of respective political parties.
The commission also took notice of the entry of armed men into a polling station in Balochistan Assembly’s PB-50 constituency in Qilla Abdullah.
On the complaints of some candidates and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, the ECP sought a report over the alleged abduction of the polling staff.
Earlier, the ECP had set up an Election Monitoring Control Centre at its Islamabad Secretariat to monitor the polling process during the by-elections.
The ECP also introduced a helpline and email address for citizens to register their complaints about the polling process.
An official statement said the monitoring centre would function till the completion of the polling process.
‘Voters rejected PTI’
As results were still awaited late on Sunday night, Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed his party, PML-N’s, victory and said it was a “manifestation of people’s trust” in the incumbent government’s policy, APP reported.
He added that the results were a “clear rejection” of PTI’s “narrative of falsehood”, which was created by the party’s leader from behind bars.
“Preliminary results of today’s by-polls have validated the fact that the people of Pakistan firmly believe in the leadership of the PML-N,” the minister said in a video message.
He added the economic reforms implemented by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his team “had given hope to the masses” who “reposed their trust in the government by voting for the PML-N”.
The incumbent government had “kicked off the journey towards economic stability” by curbing inflation and increasing foreign reserves, Mr Tarar said in his message. 
He accused the PTI leadership of “conspiring against the country”. “They are issuing statements from jails that have seriously damaged the credibility of Pakistan at the international level.”
“People have rejected the PTI founder’s politics of hatred, chaos, division, falsehood and hypocrisy,” the minister said in an apparent reference to the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
He said the performance of the PML-N governments in the centre and Punjab resulted in the victory. He also thanked the voters for exercising their democratic right and “standing by truth and burying the narrative of falsehood,” APP added.

2,Saudi delegation visits Karachi airport for ‘Road to Makkah’ plan,The Saudi consul general in Karachi also accompanied the Saudi team.,"KARACHI / RAWALPINDI: A two-member team of Saudi Arabia visited Jinnah International Airport in Karachi to inspect the airport’s facilities and to discuss arrangements for intending Haj and Umra pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, a spokesman for the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority said on Sunday.
The Saudi team’s visit was part of the ‘Road to Makkah Project’, a Saudi initiative meant to streamline the immigration process for intending Haj and Umrah pilgrims to the holy land. 
The initiative was launched by the Saudi Ministry of Haj and Umrah in 2019 and it has been implemented in five countries, including Pakistan.
The Saudi consul general in Karachi also accompanied the Saudi team.
Upon the arrival at the airport, the Saudi delegation was warmly welcomed by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s acting airport manager as well as representatives of other departments and agencies concerned.
During the comprehensive tour of the airport, the Saudi delegation was shown the path Haj pilgrims would take from the main entrance to the immigration area.
The delegation showed keen interest in the entry process for intending pilgrims and the immigration space available for the pilgrims. 
Other key points discussed were related to allocation of immigration halls and other issues. Furthermore, emphasis was placed on the importance of pilgrims arriving at least five hours before their flights’ departure time to ensure sufficient time for carrying out necessary procedures and preparations.

3,"‘Taliban-linked’ cleric killed in Quetta, buried in Afghanistan",Quetta police have initiated an investigation into the killing.,"QUETTA: A prominent prayer leader who was gunned down by unidentified motorcyclists on Friday evening in the Nawan Killi area of Quetta was buried in his home province of Zabul in Afghanistan, officials said on Sunday.
The body of the cleric, Mohammad Omar Jan Akhundzada, was taken to Afghanistan by his family, an official, who asked not to be named, told Dawn. The official revealed that Mr Akhundzada was a leader of the Afghan Taliban but had been living in Nawan Killi, a human settlement on Quetta’s outskirts, for more than 13 years.
Before his assassination, he had succeeded his father as the prayer leader at the same mosque. He was around 55 years old, a holder of a Pakistani national identity card, and owned a house in the area.
Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban government, posted on the social media platform X that Mr Akhundzada was a senior religious scholar and had previously taught at a Taliban-run madrassa in Kandahar. He was also a member of the Afghan Taliban’s oversight committee.
Quetta police have initiated an investigation into the killing. “We are investigating the killing of Molvi Mohammad Omar Jan but were unaware of his status within the Taliban government in Afghanistan,” a senior police officer said. He added that more details would be shared after the investigation is concluded.
According to sources, Mr Akhundzada had moved to Quetta about 13 years ago following disagreements with the Afghan Taliban, living with his father, who also resided in Nawan Killi. However, his family has denied any links with the Taliban government.
Sources also said that Mr Akhundzada was close to Taliban supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, who had also served as a prayer leader in a mosque in Kuchlak before leading the Afghan Taliban.
Police officials in Quetta said no individual or group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing of Molvi Mohammad Omar Jan.

4,Foreign Minister Dar compares X curbs with US stance on TikTok,Rights activists say ‘almost impossible’ to engage with platform following Musk’s takeover.,"FOREIGN Minister Ishaq Dar has justified the government’s move to block access to social media platform X (formerly Twitter), saying that it was the government’s prerogative to take actions that are “in the best interests of Pakistan”, VOA reported.
In an apparent swipe at Washington’s efforts to ban TikTok unless it cut ties with its Chinese parent company, Mr Dar said “may I ask those countries that they also have put [a] ban on certain apps … so, one country is OK, and Twitter banned in Pakistan is not OK?”
“Surely, the country will take its own decision in the light of different reasons, which were the basis of — you know — putting it off [suspending it],” he said during an interaction with the media last week.
On Wednesday, the Sindh High Court gave the government one week to withdraw the ban, which the interior ministry claimed was imposed “in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation”.

Rights activists say ‘almost impossible’ to engage with platform following Musk’s takeover

However, the court noted that the ministry’s letter did not give any reasons for why the platform was blocked, nor did it comply with the established rules for blocking of harmful online content.
Justifying the suspension of X, the interior ministry had told the high court the platform was not registered locally as a company and had ignored requests to remove content maligning the chief justice of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Haroon Baloch of Bytes for All — a think tank that focuses on information and communication technologies — said that the requirement for local registration was an attempt to influence a company and gain access to users’ data.
“They [Pakistani authorities] wanted data of Pakistani social media users to be housed or hosted through Pakistan and not be hosted outside Pakistan,” Mr Baloch told VOA.
He said that it was almost impossible for media freedom workers to engage with X following Elon Musk’s takeover of the company.
Bytes for All research indicates the global content hosting company Akamai may be helping Pakistan implement the ban by rejecting requests from users to connect to X.
VOA asked Akamai if Pakistani authorities had requested help to block users. The company said via email that it was “currently not aware of any such requests.”

5,KP cautions against deporting Afghans living ‘legally’ in Pakistan,Barrister Saif says such actions could ‘foment hatred’ between Islamabad and Kabul,"KARACHI: A spokesperson for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has warned that Afghan nationals living legally in Pakistan should not be “harassed or expelled”, Dawn.com reported on Sunday.
In an interview with DawnNewsTV last week, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif warned that any action in this regard could sour relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The PTI leader’s statement has come at a time when the government is planning to initiate the second phase of the repatriation drive to send nearly one million ‘documented’ Afghans back to their homeland.
The district authorities and police have been directed to map and collect data on their whereabouts across the country.
He said that all illegal Afghan migrants in KP had already been repatriated and that no action was currently underway against legal Afghan residents.

Barrister Saif says such actions could ‘foment hatred’ between Islamabad and Kabul

“During the first phase, we were tasked to identify illegal Afghans in KP, and they were deported”, he said.
“All Afghans without any documentation in KP have returned to Afghanistan.”
Barrister Saif noted that the only Afghans left in the province were those in possession of Afghan Citizen Cards, in accordance with Pakistani law and international resolutions from bodies like the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
“The federal government has only tasked us to track how many legal Afghans are in KP. Our mapping has shown that 359,000 live in the province”, he said, adding that no orders to take action against anyone have been issued.
“If we are instructed to expel them [legal Afghans], then we will talk [to the authorities]. Deporting illegal Afghans was justified, but we cannot harass or target Afghans living here legally”, he said.
He warned that any action against legal Afghans would “foment hatred, misunderstanding and mistrust between us and Afghanistan”.
“The federal government should approach this situation delicately,” he added.

6,Roedad Khan – the bureaucrat who witnessed history firsthand,"An alumnus of Lahore’s Forman Christian College and the Aligarh Muslim University, Khan joined the Pakistan Administrative Service in 1949."," 

Roedad Khan

ROEDAD Khan, a veteran bureaucrat who witnessed history from multiple perches and served several rulers — from General Ayub Khan to Nawaz Sharif — passed away on Sunday at the age of 101.
Born in Mardan in pre-partition India, Mr Khan had celebrated his 100th birthday on September 23, last year. His passing was announced by prominent politician and relative, Mushahid Hussain Sayed.
“He lived a full life of service to Pakistan during our most tumultuous period plus post retirement: pioneered Environmental Protection for Islamabad, authored books and became bold activist for democracy and human rights! Truly a unique, multifaceted personality of our times! He will be missed by his countless admirers!” he posted on X.
 






Mr Khan is survived by five sons and a daughter. He was laid to rest at the H-11 graveyard, and his funeral was attended by a number of prominent individuals, including Afrasiab Khattak, Wasim Sajjad, Raja Zafarul Haq, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, Riaz Muhammad Khan, Faisal Javed and others.
A storied career
An alumnus of Lahore’s Forman Christian (FC) College and the Aligarh Muslim University, Mr Khan joined the Pakistan Administrative Service in 1949.
In the Ayub Khan-era, he served as deputy commissioner in Peshawar and was later the commissioner of Karachi from 1963 to 1965, around the time the capital was being shifted to Islamabad.
Mr Khan served as the head of Pakistan Television during the historic 1970 election under Yahya Khan. Then, under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, he served as the federal secretary of tourism department. Under General Ziaul Haq, he became the federal interior secretary between 1978 and 1988.
When that tenure came to an end, Mr Khan was appointed secretary general of the interior ministry by his friend and long-time colleague, Ghulam Ishaq Khan. When he finally quit the civil service, Roedad Khan was immediately appointed the minister of accountability during Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s first tenure in power, in 1990.
But Mr Khan did not dwell much on the controversial subjects of civil-military relations, the abuse of power by bureaucracy and corruption within its ranks. His book, A Dream Gone Sour, as the title suggests, was about wasted opportunities that Pakistan could have availed to prosper as a peaceful country.
He blamed “adventurous military rulers and insecure politicians such as Zulfikar Ali Bhutto” but was quick to defend any real or imagined role he had. “I was in civil service. I had to serve. I didn’t do anything wrong,” he insisted in an interview with the Herald in 2014.
It was also claimed that he was the man who signed Z.A. Bhutto’s execution order — in his capacity as interior secretary — but he disputed the claim. “I never signed the execution order. The Central Jail Rawalpindi comes under the home secretary of Punjab, not the federal interior secretary… The black warrant came from Lahore,” he told the Herald in 2014.
Life after retirement
But even after his retirement, the storied bureaucrat continued to be an active member of civil society.
According to Mushahid Hussain, Mr Khan joined the ANP for some time after his retirement. At the time, his brother Abdul Khaliq Khan was the number two man in the party.
Mr Hussain recalled how, in 1988, both he (in his capacity as journalist) and Roedad Khan (as a member of ANP) attended the funeral of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan — popularly known as Bacha Khan — in Jalalabad.
Roedad Khan had joined the PTI around five years ago.
“He was the founding president of Margalla Hills Society and filed a case in the Supreme Court against the proposed tunnel in Margalla Hills, which he won. He also played an active role in the movement for the restoration of the judiciary in 2007,” Mushahid Hussain told Dawn.
Mr Hussain also recalled the ‘Saturday Club’, which saw retired generals, judges, bureaucrats, diplomats and other prominent personalities congregating at Mr Khan’s residence to talk about all things under the sun.
Writing for the Herald in 2015, Aurangzaib Khan described one such meeting thus: “The sunlight winks through the soaring pine-heads in a street off Islamabad’s Margalla Road. Inside, a select group of mandarins, former bureaucrats, retired diplomats, ex-judges is engaged in a heated discussion on current affairs.”
“All eyes are set on Roedad Khan, who seems like a ghost from the past — gaunt, frail and yet imposing in his warm tweed jacket… He raises and moves his thin index finger to moderate the discussion. There is no agenda, he says of the gathering that takes place with clockwork regularity at his home, ‘just people with enormous experience and background letting their hair down.’
Reporters still muse how they would even get story tips from those gatherings.

7,Plan prepared to clear rain nullah encroachments in Quetta,"Initiative aims to protect the provincial capital from urban flooding, which the city recently experienced during heavy rains.","QUETTA: The Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) and the irrigation department have jointly prepared a comprehensive plan to restore rain nullahs to their original design by removing all encroachments.
This initiative aims to protect the provincial capital, Quetta, from urban flooding, which the city recently experienced during heavy rains.
QMC Administrator Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat said on Sunday that Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti has taken serious notice of the urban flooding situation and directed the launch of a drive to remove all constructions illegally built by people on the rain nullahs.
“Rain nullahs were encroached upon at 82 locations, causing blockages in the flow of rainwater during heavy rains,” he said. The campaign to clean garbage dumps and open all blocked drains has been accelerated to transform Quetta into a clean city.
He also urged citizens to maintain environmental cleanliness and remove encroachments on nullahs. Sewerage lines are causing a massive stench, and the disposal of plastic bags and other solid waste leads to the blockage of the smooth flow of nullah water.

He added that not only the modern universities in the region but across the globe were also conducting research upon his philosophy and teachings.
The prime minister said that Dr Iqbal’s verses and writings in Persian and Urdu languages had been popular in the world.
