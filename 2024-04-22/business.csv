3,Remittance dependence in a changing world,Changes in host countries of the bulk of Pakistan’s immigrants have not been kind in recent years.," 

Source: World Bank

Export of manpower has brought it the welcome buoy of remittances that supports it balance of payments. Ramazan led the quantum of remittances to increase to nearly $3bn in March, its highest level since April 2022 and more than twice the amount of Pakistan’s top export of textiles. However, changes in host countries of the bulk of Pakistan’s immigrants have not been kind in recent years.
Take Saudi Arabia’s futuristic $500bn Neom City project, for instance. Media reports suggested that Pakistan would have provided a workforce for it; there were some plans for a special quota for skilled and semi-skilled workers and a proposal for a local state-of-the-art skill university to train them. But the project has been massively scaled back. Citing sources, Bloomberg reports that only 2.4km of the 170km city is to be completed by 2030.
The Russia-Ukraine war spiked energy prices, the repercussions of which Pakistan is still facing in the aftermath of the exchange rate spiralling up. The Middle East crisis can wreak similar havoc, though it has not significantly affected the economy as yet. Since it is the US election year, back-channel dealings may have de-escalated tensions between Israel and Iran to keep fuel prices down.
Pakistan is one of the top ten recipient of remittances in the world.
However, keeping brain drain aside, the number of people leaving Pakistan has decelerated in recent years. Not because people are eager to remain in the country, but because the world is no longer in need of massive imports of manual labour.

4,ANALYSIS: Fruits production on a downward spiral,Cultivation declines as farmers favour high-return field crops over fruits.,"


 
To begin with, we must acknowledge two indisputable facts that encompass our daily diet and Pakistan’s agricultural landscape. 
First, fruits are an invaluable source of essential vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants. However, in Pakistan, the current availability of fruits and vegetables is around 100 grams and 53 grams per capita per day, respectively. This underscores the need for policy intervention to enhance access, affordability, and consumption. 
Second, Pakistan’s diverse agro-climatic conditions support cultivating a wide variety of fruits, ranging from temperate to subtropical and tropical. In addition, fertile soil, diverse topography, and good-quality groundwater and canal water offer conducive conditions for cultivating 29 types of fruits.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research’s Fruits, Vegetables, and Condiments Statistics indicate that over the last ten years, despite such enabling factors, the total area cropped under fruits has shrunk from 0.8 million hectares in the fiscal year 2012-2013 to 0.7m hectares in FY23, reflecting a staggering 10.9 per cent decrease. 

Cultivation declines as farmers favour high-return field crops over fruits

Over the stated period, the areas cultivated for citrus and mango — the top two fruits of Pakistan — have experienced a decline of 19.5pc and 9.3pc, respectively. Likewise, the apple-growing area has seen a reduction of 27pc, while the pomegranate area has decreased by 43pc, guava by 18pc, plum by 13pc, apricot by 49pc, and almond by 26pc. 
Recent statistics from the last five years (2018-2023) also indicate a declining trend in the area cropped for dates — the country’s third largest fruit by area. The exceptions to this downward trend are bananas, grapes, and melons, which have short to medium gestation periods.
The decline in the fruit-growing area can be attributed to a range of factors, including the encroachment of housing colonies upon fertile agricultural land and fruit orchards, diminished rainfall due to climate change in certain areas of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and reduced availability of irrigation water. 
Additionally, in recent years, factors such as increased cropping intensity, higher crop yields, and improved crop prices have collectively enhanced the profitability of agronomic crops, incentivising farmers to replace fruit orchards with field crops. 
Adding to the challenge, the burgeoning population has led to land fragmentation across generations. Small orchards, typically less than 10 acres in size, often struggle to remain economically viable due to limited market access for their produce, especially when located outside the major fruit-growing clusters.
What’s amazing is, despite the substantial reduction in fruit-growing area, the country’s fruit production increased from 6.5m tonnes in FY13 to 8.7m tonnes in FY23 — a phenomenal rise of 34pc. 
However, setting aside concerns regarding the reliability and authenticity of the government statistics, the possible explanation for this surge can be attributed to two factors. 
Firstly, there has been a phenomenal increase in yields. For instance, statistics indicate that apple yields have increased from 5.4 tonnes per hectare in FY13 to 10.4 tonnes per hectare in FY23 — an impressive but somewhat unbelievable increase of around 93pc. Similarly, citrus, pomegranate, guava, and apricot have experienced incredible yield increases of 38pc, 67pc, 100pc, and 123pc, respectively.
Secondly, melons and bananas have seen a remarkable increase in their area and production. Interestingly, while the area under melon cultivation has increased by 33pc, the production has skyrocketed by a remarkable 230pc — constituting around 22pc of the country’s total fruit production. Likewise, banana cultivation has witnessed a 46pc increase in area and a staggering 178pc rise in production over the past decade. 
The crux of the problem is that orchard farmers face dwindling financial returns compared to alternative crops. Without an increase in these returns, all efforts to persuade farmers to prioritise fruit cultivation will likely be in vain, especially for fruits with a long gestation period. 
Production cost needs to be reduced by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of inputs through technology upgrades, farmers’ training, and better-quality extension service. Given the frequent watering requirements of fruit orchards and price hikes in diesel and electricity, significant reductions in production costs can be achieved by providing a one-time subsidy for solar-powered tube wells and high-efficiency irrigation solutions, irrespective of orchard size.
Thus far, our primary focus has largely been increasing yields and enhancing fruit quality, both of which have their own merits. However, in the present landscape, high losses occurring at production, harvests, and post-harvest stages, to the tune of around 40pc to 50pc, have become increasingly paramount. Therefore, there exists a pressing need to increase net yield — total yield after accounting for these losses — by improving orchard management practices and upgrading harvest and post-harvest technologies. After all, farmers will be the ultimate beneficiary of a reduction in such losses. 
There is a pressing need to narrow the gap between farm gate values and retail prices. During periods of market oversupply, fruit prices often plummet to levels that fail to cover even the harvesting and packaging costs incurred by the farmer. Despite this, retail prices in cities remain high, benefiting multiple intermediaries the most. 
In conclusion, the multi-dimensional challenge of shrinking fruit-growing areas requires targeted interventions at policy and operational levels. However, despite the rollout of numerous horticulture development projects at the federal and provincial levels during previous years, the continued decline in area signals an urgent need for a revaluation of our conventional approaches.

President Biden has done more to address climate change than any of his predecessors. So far, voters don’t seem to care. It is unclear whether climate policies could reverse the deep scepticism many young people feel toward Biden. Recent Wall Street Journal polls have found that Biden’s support among young people is shrinking compared with 2020 amid concerns about the president’s age and his support for Israel’s war against Hamas. A Journal poll, which surveyed voters in seven swing states in March, found that just 3pc of 18-to-34-year-old voters named climate change as their top issue, with most citing the economy, inflation or immigration. That is roughly in line with voters of all ages, 2pc of whom cited climate change as their top issue. Other polls show that young people are more likely than older voters to say addressing climate change is important, even if many don’t name it as their top priority.

Costco gold
Americans can’t get enough gold. Costco, which started offering gold bars last year online and in a few stores, has been selling out within hours. Consumers rated gold as a better investment than stocks and mutual funds in 2023 for the first time in a decade, according to a Gallup poll. The price has been hitting record highs. Gold buyers, especially those on the younger side, say it is a hedge against catastrophe. Even people who aren’t building bunkers and predicting doomsday are increasingly preparing for worst-case scenarios. Some millennial investors said they don’t trust the financial system, especially after a series of bank failures last year. Searching for a safe store of value, some turned to gold — and Costco. The warehouse retailer said it sold $100m in gold bars in 2023. It later added silver coins to its inventory. Precious metal sales helped drive 18pc year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales during its most recent quarter, which ended in February, Costco said.

Fed easing not likely
For most of the year everyone from stockpickers and homebuyers to President Joe Biden has banked on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates soon. Over the past two weeks, those hopes have been dashed. Annual consumer price inflation in March, at 3.5pc, was higher than expected for the third month in a row; retail sales grew by 0.7pc on the previous month. On April 16, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, warned that the battle against inflation was taking “longer than expected”. Investors had begun 2024 pricing in more than 1.5 percentage points of interest-rate cuts over the course of the year. Today, they expect rates to fall by only 0.5 points. The euphoric expectations for rate cuts took on a life of their own after the Fed turned too doveish in December. That unduly stimulated the economy and will force the central bank to retrace its steps and then some. The consequences of higher-for-longer interest rates will reverberate around America, financial markets and the world economy.

Getting comfortable with AI
Three ways to develop and practice the habit of maintaining AI literacy. 1) Seek the discomfort of continual learning about AI to navigate its business and technological implications. 2) Some executives might not be interested in learning why AI is relevant to the organisation and might perceive it as laborious. However, that labour is not optional anymore: AI is driving changes in processes across the enterprise so profound that they constitute significant strategic risks and opportunities within each executive’s areas of responsibility. 3) Prepare for the unexpected effects AI can cause, along with possible counterintuitive outcomes.

11,Normalising trade with India,Establishing a bilateral trading relationship could boost Pakistan’s exports by 80pc or $25bn.,"Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s recent statement about consultations with stakeholders on the resumption of trade ties with India marks a significant stride towards revitalising the economy and fostering peace in the region.
For decades, it has been evident that major political parties on both sides have advocated for normalising trade relations, but some important stakeholders had reservations. However, the National Security Policy (NSP) announced in 2021 indicated that Pakistan is prepared to move on and prioritise geoeconomics over geopolitics.
We need to recognise the importance of time and make smart choices for our future. Pakistan’s economy has not been doing well: in FY23, it shrank by 0.6 per cent, and it’s predicted to grow only by 2pc in FY24 against a population growth of 2.6pc.
Poverty is already a big problem, affecting about 40pc of people, and it’s getting worse due to high inflation and low growth.

Establishing a bilateral trading relationship could boost Pakistan’s exports by 80pc or $25bn

We need a proactive approach to getting out of such a hopeless situation, and normalising trade with India can bring us many benefits.
 
 

First, let’s consider the potential for total international trade growth. According to the World Bank, if we establish a normal trading relationship with India, our exports could increase by a staggering 80pc, or about $25 billion. This could be a game-changer for Pakistan — enhancing our exports, easing our shortage of foreign exchange, and boosting our GDP growth.
Second, this is the shortest route to easing inflation pressure, which has been stubbornly high since the closure of direct trade. To keep inflation under control, the State Bank has to keep the interest rate high. At 22pc, the private sector has stopped borrowing, seriously hurting industrial and GDP growth.
Third, we will save precious foreign exchange, which is currently spent rerouting goods through third countries. Much of this occurs via the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is currently India’s second-largest export market and Pakistan’s second-largest import market. Some studies suggest that with freight and eliminating other expenses involved with rerouting through third parties, Pakistan could save over $1bn annually.
The cessation of bilateral trade has disproportionately affected our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For instance, date farmers in Khairpur are forced to sell their produce to middlemen who export their goods via Dubai, significantly reducing their profits. Resuming normal trade with India would offer substantial advantages to economically disadvantaged sections of our society, making regional trade more accessible than exporting to distant countries.
Finally, Pakistan is losing out on new industries being relocated from China to diversify supply chains. Investors look for locations to source raw materials and quickly export to the regional markets. Since India is a major source of industrial raw materials and a big export market, not allowing trade makes goods manufactured in Pakistan uncompetitive.
We’re also missing the chance to grow our trade share through global value chains that make up 70pc of world trade but only 5pc of Pakistan’s.
Some argue that we should not normalise trade relations unless the Kashmir issue is resolved. However, many countries, including China and India, China and Taiwan, and Israel and Arab countries, have border disputes yet continue trading. Pakistan has had this border dispute since independence, yet the founding fathers of both countries did not resort to closing trade.
Some individuals also oppose opening up trade, fearing that India’s potential to export more than Pakistan could worsen our trade deficit. It is crucial to recognise that importing goods from India could replace more expensive imports from other sources and thus reduce our overall trade deficit.
For instance, India’s trade deficit with China amounts to approximately $100bn, and Bangladesh’s deficit with India is around $14bn. Despite these significant trade imbalances, both countries continue this trade as they realise that importing these goods elsewhere would cost more.
Since Pakistan has banned imports from India, it could take the first step of lifting the ban. Of course, India would need to reciprocate by removing extra duties imposed on Pakistani imports. Contrary to the misperception that both countries will have to negotiate a new trade agreement, the Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area framework already exists.
Perhaps the only complication is the forthcoming elections in India, which will start later this month and continue until June. In the meantime, our government could do some homework on building consensus and make a roadmap on how it intends to proceed.

12,Developing Karachi’s faulty wants over needs,Costly and superficial development projects continue to disappoint citizens.,"The new fiscal year brings a unique political combination to Sindh, especially Karachi. The same political party manages the province and city. Some optimists believe that Karachi’s fate will now change as all the tiers of government are politically aligned. This may translate into the allocation of more funds for Karachi in the forthcoming budgets. 
It is an oversimplification to link the problems that Karachi faces to the proportion of budgetary sums earmarked for development projects. The metropolis is experiencing three distinct ranges of problems that merit a dispassionate review and redressal. These include non-democratic decision-making that fails to address mass issues, progressive decay in municipal institutions’ service delivery capacity, and an overemphasis on project-based development. 
It is not that Karachi has not received budgetary allocations in the past — the city received project finances of sizable magnitude during the past two decades. However, most of these projects were of little benefit to the locality and sector of performance where they were initiated. 
Present-day Karachi and its residents are victims of many development decisions and consequent implementation works that were initiated without considering the impacts and benefits for the masses. 
Take, for example, the Lyari Expressway, a transportation project launched some two decades ago, which was completed after significant delays and several cost escalations. The project wreaked havoc on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, evicting them to extend relief to a few thousand vehicle operators. 

Costly and superficial development projects continue to disappoint citizens 

The whole undertaking was mired in non-transparent, technically inappropriate choices, components of which were investigated by a federal entity. Over Rs23 billion were spent on the Lyari Expressway and another over Rs10bn on re-settling evicted residents. With such a sum, a comprehensive road repairs and maintenance programme for the entire city could have been initiated to benefit millions of commuters. 
Without drawing any lessons from this venture, a Malir Expressway has been launched at a higher price tag of Rs39bn, though in a public-private partnership mode. It is common sense that the project has nothing to offer to the common Karachi commuter — it is being initiated to enhance the connectivity of large-scale private real estate developments.
Little real-time benefit is expected to flow down to ordinary city residents. If one inquires about the needs of ordinary Karachi commuters who travel in snail-paced tri-wheelers, rickety buses and mini-buses, they would demand upgrading this fleet of buses and mini-buses with better options. 
Facilitation of private operators through innovatively designed credit schemes for procuring and operating buses/mini-buses, regulating and upscaling the dial-a-ride bus services, allocation of serviced parking and workshop facilities, and conducting driver and vehicle staff training programmes to raise operational efficiency are the most desired interventions. These can be done at far less cost than the sanctioned expressways for the city.
The declining state of urban service delivery is another common observation in Karachi. Urban sanitation, especially solid waste collection, is a case in point. Getting the better of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, the Sindh administration cleverly acquired control of solid waste management, which was traditionally a responsibility of local bodies. 
The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) now manages much of the city’s waste management tasks. Some months ago, the Municipal Workers Trade Union Alliance raised serious concerns about the overall performance, including the poor operation and maintenance practices adopted by the SSWMB contractor. 
Scores of private hospitals and healthcare facilities have opened up across the city, generating hospital waste of a very hazardous nature. Expansion in the usage of electronic gadgets has given rise to electronic waste. Rubber, plastic, paper, garden, industrial and biological waste of different volumes, contents and characteristics is generated as a natural outcome. 
While normal municipal waste is hardly removed, the new formats of waste dumps are lying unattended to a great extent. After collection, the waste is temporarily dumped in various sites termed as garbage transfer stations and finally taken to the two dumping sites at Jam Chakro near Surjani Town and Govind Pass near Hub. 
Time and again, garbage is burnt to reduce its volume and make room for fresh disposal. For more than three decades, these sites have been waiting for transformation into properly designed and managed sanitary landfill facilities with a scientific monitoring mechanism. 
In terms of project and programme finances, the optics of allocated spending on various projects in Karachi appear very impressive. The Karachi Water and Sanitation Improvement Programme (KWSSIP) — supported by the World Bank — plans to invest $1.6bn in a four-phased plan over 12 years. The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line project — funded by Asian Development Bank and other donors — is a $503 million proposition. Similarly, the BRT Yellow Line (Karachi Mobility Project) will cost $428m. 
There are many more on the list, but it must be kept in mind that all of these ‘high-sounding, high-spending’ projects will bring negligible relief in the life of the ordinary.
This brings us to the conclusion that isolated decisions about development spending seldom bring real relief to service users. People-friendly and democratically ratified choices of development and urban management must be identified to obtain the best value for taxpayers’ money.

13,Fragility amidst global turmoil,"Given its reliance on energy imports and large expatriate population, Pakistan stands to suffer more than other Asian countries as tensions in the Middle East rise.","Beyond conventional diplomatic efforts, Pakistan has yet to undertake a comprehensive national-level initiative to meticulously monitor, analyse and prepare for the potential ramifications of the escalating cycle of retaliation in the Middle East.
These potential effects encompass a surge in oil prices, displacement of the Pakistani workforce in the Middle East, deferment of work on the already-delayed Iran-Pakistan (IP) pipeline project, flight of investors from the region, supply chain disruptions and an increase in the logistic costs of trade.
The hierarchy in the ministries of commerce, finance, planning, and foreign affairs was approached to shed light on the country’s strategy to mitigate the economic repercussions of the unfolding situation in the Middle East. Given the challenges faced by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s government in maintaining stability, curbing inflation, and stimulating growth, this insight was deemed crucial.
Officials from the relevant ministries appeared reluctant to provide insight, as they lacked calculated projections regarding the potential impact on trade, investment sentiment, remittances, balance of trade, currency valuation and industry in the event of supply chain disruptions. Some indicated, by phone from Islamabad, that they were unaware if the government had assigned anyone to research the subject.

Given its reliance on energy imports and large expatriate population, Pakistan stands to suffer more than other Asian countries as tensions in the Middle East rise

In its formal response, the spokesperson’s office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, “The question regarding the economic impact of the escalating Middle East crisis on Pakistan falls under the purview of the Ministry of Commerce, and they may be consulted for further clarity.”
The global oil market initially surged but quickly stabilised following Iran’s retaliatory attack on Israel, suggesting that global efforts to prevent further escalation might be effective. However, some analysts caution that crude oil prices could still surpass the $100 per barrel mark soon, with current prices hovering around $83 per barrel and Brent at $87 per barrel. Such an increase could have grave implications for Pakistan’s balance of account and inflation.
Middle East conflicts have disrupted the mobility of both people and goods. Shipping sources indicate that sea and air freight rates and insurance costs for commercial containers may rise by five to 10 per cent. This increase is attributed to commercial liners opting for longer routes and higher insurance premiums due to elevated risks.
Babar Badat, former president and current board member of International Federation of Freight Forwarders Association and a recognised logistic expert, was not surprised at the inaction. “Various governments in Pakistan, irrespective of the leadership, have not been able to address the subject of international logistic capabilities, including shipping capacity.
“There is no national plan nor strategy to develop this area, and when we face rising freight costs, we spring into action post-event. Eventually, the nation ends up paying the price,” Mr Badat said, commenting on the lack of preparedness to deal with the unfolding situation.
He anticipated another freight cost increase that would impact Pakistan’s trade, both imports and exports. He couldn’t rule out supply chain disruptions, which could harm Pakistan’s economy, given its heavy reliance on imported raw materials and parts for most industries. He lamented the government’s lack of interest in the crucial logistic sector, especially shipping.
“Can you name any other country as large as Pakistan with a 1,100km coastline without a single container ship? Today 95pc of trade (excluding bulk) is carried in containers. Pakistan’s trade, therefore, is 100pc dependent on foreign carriers.”
Talking about cross border trucking he said, “While our national fleet may be around 3,00,000 trucks, internationally compliant trucking fleet is very small. Besides, most countries have a significant (40-60pc) portion of their exports within their region. Our regional trade stands at barely 6pc. The lack of a regionally compliant trucking fleet inhibits the potential for trade growth in the region.”
“Pakistan is one of the few countries which does not have transport and logistics ministry, therefore lacks a focal forum to bring these issues to the fore,” he added.
According to media reports, 77pc of Pakistani expats (4.7 million) reside in the Middle East. In an extreme scenario, war fears could trigger reverse migration. Even in less dire circumstances, unrest, growing market anxieties and suppressed economic activity may reduce the quantum of remittances from the region — a crucial resource for Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, the current account and rupee valuation. Over half of the country’s nearly $30 billion annual remittances originate from the Middle East.
Amid threats of tougher Western sanctions on Iran following recent strikes, the fate of the IP project, seen as a major step towards achieving energy security, is likely to be deferred once more to steer clear of the pitfalls of collaborating with a nation sanctioned by the West.
Furthermore, footloose investors and fund holders are reportedly weighing the risk of further retaliations, with many opting for more secured options in stable locations. The more apprehensive investors are moving funds to safe havens — hard currencies, government securities and gold.
Without prior background research, the topic of debate regarding the strategy was not even raised in official and business circles. While many analysts and fund managers downplayed the potential threats to Pakistan’s economy, a few indicated that the situation could once again thrust Pakistan in the global spotlight. They referenced the Soviet Union’s 1979 Afghanistan invasion and the 2001 United States terrorist attack in this regard.
“If the government strategically leverages Pakistan’s unique position adjacent to Iran and holds influence in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, it could potentially assume a diplomatic role in the troubled region on behalf of the developed world. This could yield rich dividends for Pakistan,” suggested a keen watcher who preferred to remain anonymous.
Most business bodies expressed discomfort with the government’s apparent lack of foresight regarding the escalating regional crisis. They fear that Pakistan, due to its geography and close commercial and diplomatic ties in the region, maybe more adversely impacted than other Asian nations.
Abdul Aleem, Secretary General of the Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industries, highlighted the impact saying, “Given Pakistan’s heavy reliance on energy imports from the region, any disruption in oil could lead to higher domestic energy prices, affecting industries, transportation, and overall economic activity.
“Additionally, the presence of a significant number of Pakistani expatriates working in Gulf countries means escalating tensions may jeopardise job security and remittance inflows.
“Moreover, regional peace is crucial for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), and any disturbance could negatively impact FDI inflows across the region, with implications for the balance of payments and exchange rate stability.”
Ehsan Malik, CEO of Pakistan Business Council, echoed similar sentiments, stating, “The anticipated rapid decline in inflation, followed by a reduction in the policy rate, may be tempered by the rising cost of oil due to the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East.”
The background research for this story unveiled a fresh cycle of volatility and uncertainty in global markets following Iran’s pre-announced direct strikes on Israel.

14,Brewing troubles,"""A crisis in the Middle East adds to complications, potentially requiring the State Bank to increase the interest rate"".","Even though Israel and Iran have signalled their intention to walk back down the escalation ladder following their limited but direct ‘tit-for-tat’ strikes against each other since April 13, the world remains on edge due to concerns about the conflict swarming the entire Middle East.
A crucial energy supplier and a key shipping passageway, the region has been in the headlines since the beginning of Israel’s assault on Gaza after Hamas attacked the Jewish state on Oct 7.
Ever since, Israel has laid a siege on the Gaza Strip and massacred more than 34,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, besides causing widespread devastation and hunger. Half of the Gaza population “is experiencing catastrophic hunger as the threat of famine looms”, the United Nations (UN) says, with Israel planning a ground operation in Rafah.
The chances of the immediate escalation between Israel and Iran into a full-scale war seem to be diminishing for the time being. Still, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres painted a dark picture of the situation in the Middle East a day before the retaliatory Israeli attack on Isfahan on Friday, warning that spiralling tensions over the conflict in Gaza and conflict between Iran and Israel could devolve into a “full-scale regional conflict”.
“The Middle East is on a precipice. In recent days, we have seen a perilous escalation in words and deeds. One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable — a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved,” he said, calling on all parties to exercise “maximum restraint”.

‘A crisis in the Middle East adds to complications, potentially requiring the State Bank to increase the interest rate’

Hence, the prospects of a wider regional conflict have forced many countries grappling to contain inflation to mull measures in recent weeks to mitigate the potential economic fallout from such an eventuality as traders speculate possible ramifications of escalation for commodities.
The ongoing conflict in Gaza has only had a limited impact on oil prices, leading to significant shipping delays and rerouting. An escalation, however, would lead to a significant spike in oil prices and disrupt supply. Oil prices have already risen due to the incorporation of risk insurance premiums and higher shipping costs.
A Chase Securities note for its investors notes that “The spike in oil prices holds profound implications for Pakistan’s economy, especially concerning inflation dynamics and the precarious balance of the current account. These developments underscore the critical need for astute economic management and strategic planning.”
The impact of higher oil prices will extend beyond the energy sector, exerting inflationary pressure on the national economy. It would also further push out the prospect of an interest rate cut in response to volatile market conditions.
Likewise, the potential supply-chain disruptions in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz would pose additional risks to trade and economic stability, according to economic and trade analysts. They say the impact would also be felt on inflation and growth projections.
Ahmed Jamal Pirzada, a University of Bristol economist, notes that an escalation of conflict in the Middle East will predominantly affect Pakistan’s economy through its effect on energy prices and what it would mean for monetary policy in advanced economies.
“The recent economic news both in the US and the UK already suggests that it may take longer than what was previously expected for the central banks in these countries to cut interest rates by enough. Yields on US government bonds increased this week after inflation numbers turned out to be higher than expected — up from 3.1 per cent in January to 3.5pc in March,” he points out.
Mr Pirzada says that these developments are not encouraging for Pakistan as these make any decision to cut the interest rate in response to the recent decline in inflation all the more complicated.
“If monetary policy deviates too much from the trend in advanced economies, it would once again bring the exchange rate under pressure, thus reversing the decline in inflation. A crisis in the Middle East will further add to this complication, potentially requiring the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to even increase the interest rate,” he noted.
Moreover, Mr Pirzada believes that such events will also have implications for economic growth and, as a result, debt sustainability. “The SBP data already shows a contraction in the industrial sector and a stagnation in the services sector during the second quarter of FY24. The growth in GDP of only one person cent is due to improved performance in the agriculture sector.
“Any disruption in the global economy, which affects international commodity prices and turns the policy environment even more contractionary, may result in another year of negative growth. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself underscores, slower economic growth will undermine its own assessment that Pakistan’s debt is sustainable,” he concludes.
Pakistan’s economy contracted by 0.2pc during the last fiscal year and is projected to grow by 2pc this year. The multilateral lenders say the country’s growth would remain subdued to below 3.5pc over the next few years. This low growth scenario depends on a new IMF programme and the implementation of structural reforms.
Pakistan’s economy is vulnerable as it scrambles to recover from soaring inflation exacerbated by uncontrolled fiscal deficit and balance of payments troubles. In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF adjusted Pakistan’s inflation forecast upward to 24.8pc for this fiscal year and 12.7pc for the next.
Though the current account deficit has shrunk to just 1pc of the economy, it is achieved at the cost of economic growth and jobs to advertise a possible default. A recent IMF report on the Middle East and North Africa region has clubbed Pakistan with six nations facing serious conflicts this year
and said that conflicts and tight macroeconomic policy conditions would affect their economic outputs.
“Beyond West Bank and Gaza, six economies — Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — faced conflicts at the beginning of 2024,” reads the report, released on the sidelines of the World Bank-IMF spring meetings.
The report adds that the conflict in Gaza and Israel had worsened an already challenging environment, and disruptions to shipping through the Red Sea had added to uncertainty.
It also underlines that an uneven recovery against a backdrop of armed conflicts, hydrocarbon dependence, and persistent structural challenges characterised the economic growth outlook for the region and Pakistan.
“The situation is fluid, and the full impact on the country’s economy, international trade, inflation, and prices is yet to be seen. However, what is clear is that the ongoing conflict and disruptions have significant implications for the economy,” Haroon Sharif, a former investment minister, says.
The Middle East conflict follows the biggest shock to commodity markets in recent years — the Ukraine war — which spiked global energy and commodity prices and drained the meagre Forex reserves of Pakistan and other similar economies in the last two years.
“The initial worry about the economic consequences of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East is likely to be focused on energy (as the region heavily influences global oil and gas production),” Mr Sharif notes.
Furthermore, the escalating conflict in the Middle East would have negative implications for the current account balance, quicken inflation, introduce fresh uncertainty and challenges for rate cuts, affect international trade, and affect the fragile GDP growth prospects, he adds. Besides, the uncertain conditions will force Saudi Arabia — and others — to cancel their recently announced investment plans in Pakistan.

15,Oil prices stabilise... for now,"In the end, it turned out to be nothing “but a big show, and so the markets deflated as quickly as they spiked”, says economist.","

enter image description here

 
There is a sigh of relief in the oil markets, at least for the time being. The ‘limited’ Israeli retaliatory strike against Iran early Friday morning provided the space for Tehran to label the attacks as almost a non-event. 
The Israeli response was regarded as so weak that Israel’s hawkish national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, conceded he wasn’t happy with his country’s response. “Weak”, he said in a one-word post on X (formerly Twitter) in Hebrew, while the Iranian state TV dismissed Friday’s strike, blasting it as “Israeli and American media propaganda”. Following the attacks, oil market prices spiked but then fell. 
In an almost knee-jerk reaction to the much-anticipated Israeli attack on Iran, oil prices briefly surged Friday morning. However, they dropped quickly, following the Iran state media’s apparent downplaying of the strikes and the realisation that the Israeli retaliation was very limited in scope. This was more of an exercise in public relations to pacify its constituency. 
And, although oil market prices settled slightly higher on Friday, that was still a weekly decline. Brent futures settled up 18 cents, or 0.21 per cent, at $87.29 a barrel. The front-month US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude contract for May ended 41 cents higher, or 0.5pc, to $83.14 a barrel.

In an election year, the Biden administration cannot afford elevated gas prices, hence there has been growing diplomatic pressure on Israel and Iran to de-escalate

The more active June contract closed 12 cents higher at $82.22 a barrel. 
Both benchmarks had spiked more than $3 a barrel earlier in the session on Friday after explosions were heard in the Iranian city of Isfahan in what sources in the US and elsewhere were describing as an Israeli attack. 
However, the gains were capped after Tehran not only played down the strikes almost as a non-incident but also underlined that it did not plan to retaliate.
In the end, it turned out to be nothing “but a big show, and so the markets deflated as quickly as they spiked”, Tim Snyder, an economist at Matador Economics, was quoted as saying.
Almost the same act was played a week earlier when Iran had fired a barrage of missiles at Israel. On April 12, with the weekend approaching, everyone knew then, too, that an Iranian attack on Israeli soil was looming over the next 24 to 48 hours. Consequent to the intelligence warnings and media reports of the coming Iranian direct attack on Israel, oil prices spiked on Friday, April 12. 
But the Iranian attack on April 13 was also regarded by most as ‘measured and calculated’. It lasted a mere few ‘tense’ hours and was calculated and ‘measured’, with enough warning. The attacks were not designed to bring about large-scale damages, destruction and fatalities in Israel, analysts underlined. It was more to follow up on its words of responding to Israel’s April 1 attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus at ‘a time and place of its choice’. 



 
The early warning that an attack was coming also provided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his government, and the military machine of its allies present in the region with ample opportunity to be fully prepared for what was about to come. 
Consequently, in military terms, the Iranian missile and drone attacks failed to make much impact on Israel. Also, Iran refrained from using its proxies — Hezbollah and Houthis — to augment the impact of its attack on Israel. 
Thus, as soon as markets reopened for the first time after the Iranian attacks on Monday, April 15, after a brief spike, oil markets went down and stabilised — as is the case this time. The same happened after the retaliatory Israeli attack on Iran early this Friday.
Analysts believe the action and the counteraction by Iran and Israel show that both sides wanted to avoid a full-blown conflict that could choke off the supply of oil to the world from the oil-rich Middle East. 
Further, an increase in US crude oil inventories, which shot up the last week by 2.7 million barrels to approximately 460m barrels, also helped calm the crude oil markets. 
Markets are also taking into account that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) have a spare capacity of roughly 6m barrels per day (bpd), and that capacity could be immediately brought into the markets if required. 
“Traders are also relatively sanguine because Opec+ producers, which have been implementing voluntary cuts since 2022, will be ready to pump more crude in the event of an escalation that causes prices to jump towards $100,” the Financial Times reported in a follow-up piece.
Controlling inflation remains a major objective of most central banks of the world today. If oil prices begin to get higher, most understand that efforts to control inflation would receive a major blow, and that cannot be permitted. Furthermore, in an election year, the Biden administration cannot afford elevated prices at gas stations. Hence, there has been growing diplomatic pressure on Israel and Iran from all around to de-escalate tensions in the region and avoid any flaring up. 
Hectic, behind-the-scenes diplomacy seems to be making an impact. There is now a growing confidence in the market that the Israeli action will not escalate into a broader conflict in the Middle East. For the time being, the oil markets have shrugged off the Israeli attacks, and the possibility of any expansion of the war theatre in the Middle East has gone down. 
All this could eventually lead to a reduction in the war premium, and oil prices could go down to some extent over the next few days and weeks — unless something unforeseen overtakes the markets.

16,Finance: Economy in need of sobriety,"Authorities, quick to celebrate hollow victories, must wake up and deal with the realities of current law, order, governance, and economic situation to improve.","The situation of street crimes in Karachi is better than Washington and Paris, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon boasted last week. Quoting updates from the International Crime Index, he said at a presser that Karachi ranked 78th out of 333 cities in various countries, according to a Dawn report.
Had the staff of the learned minister looked at the right page of Numbeo.Com (the one that displays current ratings), he would have been more pleasantly surprised to know that Karachi, in fact, ranks 82nd out of 345 cities in various countries. (The minister’s staff apparently gleaned information from the page that displayed historical indices). But that’s beside the point.
Now, let’s revisit Numbeo.com and look at the current ratings. There, we find that Rawalpindi, Lahore and Islamabad have far better rankings — 131st, 235th and 270th, respectively. Businessmen in Karachi must grow wiser now and move their businesses to these three cities.
This is a classic example of how government officials downplay the existence of a serious problem. The law and order situation in Karachi is a perennial problem that, along with poor road and transport infrastructure and lack of proper water and sanitation systems, continues to block fresh local and foreign investment in the city — Pakistan’s commercial and industrial hub.

Authorities, quick to celebrate hollow victories, must wake up and deal with the realities of current law, order, governance, and economic situation to improve

One hopes that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), jointly run by the civil and military leadership, will show more seriousness than our learned provincial minister in helping Sindh improve Karachi’s law and order situation. This has become imperative as the SIFC has now started making big achievements in attracting foreign investment — at least in terms of initial pledges.
During the visit of Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al-Saud to Pakistan last week, Pakistan pitched 25 projects with an estimated potential foreign investment of $32 billion to the high-powered Saudi delegation. There is a fair chance that Saudi Arabia will agree to pour billions of dollars into at least some of the identified projects in the mining, energy, and agriculture sectors, as well as in computer chip manufacturing and railways and water dam construction.
Pakistan’s economy is projected to grow this fiscal year at two per cent at best, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the unemployment rate is expected to remain 8pc. Even in the next year starting from July the GDP, growth has been forecast at 3.5pc with unemployment rate as high as 7.5pc.
Under these circumstances, quick and massive inflows of foreign investment are a must for a country that has been struggling to manage its balance of payments (BoP) as both the stocks of external debts and their servicing costs grow, plunging the country deeper into a debt trap.
Exports and remittances have started rising, but together, they are just enough to finance the overall deficit in merchandise and services trade. This means the country must arrange foreign exchange from other sources for external debt servicing.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented a strong case for Pakistan’s needs and eligibility for a long-term IMF loan before the Fund during his recent visit to Washington. The current $3bn short-term loan will expire this month after the release of the last tranche of $1.1bn.
The security situation in the Middle East after Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel in retaliation for the April 1 attack on its Consulate in Damascus, Israel, is no less than explosive. The region may soon find itself engulfed in a wider, multi-frontal military conflict if a full-scale war between Tehran and Tel Aviv breaks out.
One can imagine its negative fallouts on global trade and investment. For a country like Pakistan facing an acute shortage of foreign exchange, seeking BoP support from the IMF and additional development funding from the World Bank may become more challenging and perhaps unofficially tied to its position in the hourly-unfolding Iran-Israel conflict.
It is time for our federal and provincial governments to accept disturbing facts about law, order and governance as they are and work harder to address them as efficiently as possible. It is time for them to win the hearts of the business community and overseas Pakistanis to ensure that the growth momentum seen recently in exports and remittances is not lost. Over nine months of this fiscal year, goods’ exports grew about 9pc to $22.9bn, and remittances increased by about 1pc to $21bn.
It is heartening to note that the stage is being set for attracting huge foreign investment from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, as well as from China and the US. The government and SIFC deserve due credit for this.
However, it is equally important to address the genuine grievances of the local business community to whatever extent it is possible rather than telling them that the street crime situation in Karachi is better than in Paris and Washington. It’s always unfair to match apples with oranges, isn’t it? And it is outright naive to downplay a serious problem by quoting data from crowd-sourced online databases like Numbeo.com.
Pakistan’s fiscal position is so tight that meeting the demands of local businessmen regarding subsidies and financial support is just too difficult. During 9MFY24, between July 1, 2023, and March 29, 2024, the federal government’s bank borrowings for budgetary support (on a cash basis) swelled to Rs3.6 trillion from only Rs1.9tr in the same period last year.
This happened even though the Federal Board of Revenue not only met its July-March FY24 revenue collection target of Rs6.7tr but rather surpassed it by a few billion.

17,The road to self-sufficiency,Policymakers attempt to circumnavigate IMF’s growth stagnating policies by re-directing funds to high-growth sectors.,"While reiterating Pakistan’s renewed commitment to implementing the agreed programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb made a significant observation at the Atlanta Council think tank: “We know what to do to rebuild the economy.”
Realising that the IMF stability programme is squeezing, though not closing, the space for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, policymakers are trying to direct development loans and foreign investment into growth-enabling priority sectors.
The underlying issue is how to boost productivity to meet the needs of frustrated people, which are currently met via debt-financed imports.
When asked how Pakistan would successfully rebuild its economy, Mr Aurangzeb said, “We do not need too many policy prescriptions. We know what to do. It is time for us to move on.”
Pakistan needed “timely decisions, [and] timely execution … no strategy works without execution. We need two to three years of structural reforms,” he added.
Later, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan would request a minimum three-year economic reform programme while initiating discussions with the IMF for a new loan agreement “because that’s what we need … to help execute the structural reform agenda”.
To ease external sector pressures, on April 15, the government decided to convert all imported coal-fired power plants to local coal to save an estimated $800 million on costs and reduce end-consumer rates by about Rs3 per unit.
Related news is that the World Bank will provide $1 billion for the 2,160-megawatt Dasu hydropower project that would produce cheaper electricity and save dollars spent on imported fuel.
Among the reported projects identified for the $5bn Saudi package is the Diamer-Bhasha dam. Pakistan is seeking $1.2bn of Saudi equity investment in the project. The building of the dam has been long delayed for want of funds, among other factors.
“The creation of jobs, side businesses, wealth generation, income distribution and tax revenues are the guaranteed benefits of localisation,” argues industrialist Syed Raza Hussain in his article ‘Make in Pakistan’.
“The government along with stakeholders should develop a five-year economic localisation plan, with a roadmap for achieving self-sufficiency to transform an economy of $375bn,” suggests Mr Hussain.
Some business segments have already started taking steps in this direction. Decades earlier, the former chairman of Atlas Group of Companies, the late Yusuf Hussain Shirazi, had advocated to “think globally and act locally”.
The IMF’s short-term tariff-led approach has rendered the production sector uncompetitive in exports, resulting in negative consequences on the external account, said the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) — a business policy advisory platform — in a letter to the finance minister.
“That surely is not the IMF’s objective,” wrote Ehsan Malik, PBC’s CEO.
The manufacturing sector posted a negative growth of 0.5pc during July-February compared to the same period last fiscal year.
The letter was written on the eve of the finance minister’s departure for talks on a new, larger and longer deal with the Fund in Washington. The PBC has been actively advocating the need for a ‘Make in Pakistan’ policy.
Imports were expected to expand during FY24 as domestic demand strengthened and the stabilisation of the currency market made it easier for firms to import inputs, according to current month’s ‘Asian Development Outlook’ by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The study adds that the current account deficit (CAD) is projected to widen to 1.5pc of GDP in 2024. Indeed, the IMF sees the CAD increasing to 1.1pc from 0.7pc of GDP of last year.
The ADB report pointed out that Pakistan would continue to face challenges from substantial new external financing requirements and the rollover of old debts, exacerbated by tight global financial conditions. One may add that the fears of a lingering debt default have not fully subsided.
Flagging issues that Pakistan needs to address on April 14, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva highlighted, “The tax base, how the richer part of society contributes to the economy, the way public spending is being directed and of course… creating a more transparent environment.”
Though recent efforts to diversify foreign trade have yielded positive results, they are still far from their real potential. Exports to the seven regional countries — these include Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and China, which topped the list — rose by 20.6pc in the first eight months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period last year.
And the value of exports to the five central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — rose by 21.2pc during July-February 2024 compared to the same period last year. Simultaneously, exports to the Middle East rose 35.8pc when compared with the eight months of last year.
Moreover, imports from the region have declined, resulting in a reduction in the trade deficit. The trade deficit with the Middle East narrowed by 22.6pc due to a drop in imports of petroleum products.
Pakistan’s economy is projected to grow by 2pc according to IMF’s World Economic Outlook 2024, which is lower than the global growth forecast of 3.2pc this year.
