0,Milik treble  steers Juve to Coppa semis,Juventus will face Lazio in a two-legged last-four clash in April.,"TURIN: Juventus booked a spot in their fifth consecutive Coppa Italia semi-finals after an Arkadiusz Milik hat-trick helped them earn a 4-0 win over promoted Serie A side Frosinone on Thursday. 
Juventus, who are the team that has reached the last four the most times in competition’s history — 36 in its 77 editions, will face Lazio in a two-legged last-four clash in April thanks to Poland striker Milik’s treble, which took his goal tally to five for the season in all competitions. 
Juve blew away Frosinone, who knocked out Napoli in the last 16, at the Allianz Stadium in Turin to extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 16 matches. 
“I thank the boys, who played a good match and entertained the crowd,” coach Massimiliano Allegri told Mediaset. 
“The important thing is to understand that you have to stay in the game, play hard and defend well. Today it’s a good thing we didn’t concede goals, we had conceded too many lately. We must rejoice at the victory, but from Saturday we must think about Sassuolo, who beat us in the first leg [in Serie A].” 
Milik opened the scoring from the spot in the 11th minute, sending Frosinone keeper Michele Cerofolini the wrong way after a penalty was awarded for a foul on midfielder Fabio Miretti. 
Milik doubled the hosts’ lead in the 38th minute with a neat finish, beautifully taking down Weston McKennie’s clipped ball over the top and rolling past Cerofolini. 
The 29-year-old completed his hat-trick two minutes after the break thanks to the alertness and generosity of Manuel Locatelli. 
Italy midfielder Locatelli pinched the ball off a dozing Luca Garritano on the edge of the Frosinone area and then laid on an open goal for the grateful Milik. 
Milik had the ball in the net again nine minutes later after getting his toe to Miretti’s goal-bound shot, but was just offside. 
However 18-year-old Kenan Yildiz capped a perfect evening for Juve just after the hour mark with a wonderful volleyed finish from McKennie’s raking cross. 
Frosinone’s cup run ends with a fourth straight defeat in all competitions, the first loss in that run coming against Juve in Serie A just before Christmas. 
“On paper we should be no match for Juventus, but I’d like to congratulate my players for our cup run,” said coach Eusebio Di Francesco. “What they need to understand is the jump in quality that there is when you’re up against a team like Juve.”

1,Barca down Osasuna to  set up Clasico Super Cup final,"“We’re in another final, another Clasico, which was our main objective —we didn’t play a brilliant game, but a serious, sensible one."" Xavi tells reporters.","

RIYADH: Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal shoots to score during the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Osasuna at Al-Awwal Park.—Reuters

 
RIYADH: Robert Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal scored second-half goals to give Barcelona an 2-0 win over Osasuna in a dour Spanish Super Cup semi-final in Saudi Arabia on Thursday. 
Barca set up a dream showpiece clash on Sunday with Real Madrid, who had beaten city rivals Atletico Madrid in a breathtaking 5-3 derby earlier in the week. It will be a re-match from last year’s final, which the Catalans won 3-1. 
“We want to take the ball off Real, that’s our DNA, we’re hugely motivated, it’s the moment to show our best football,” Xavi told reporters. “We’re in another final, another Clasico, which was our main objective —we didn’t play a brilliant game, but a serious, sensible one.  
“Every Clasico has its own story, we can’t predict many things, only that it will be an even game. You don’t play finals, you win them. We want to compete against an opponent who I saw very well in the other semi-final. 
“However, there are no favourites, it’s an El Clasico. Hopefully the final will go our way like last year. We are the reigning champions and at least we will enjoy it.” 
Barcelona dominated possession in a dismal first half but were bereft of ideas and barely threatened their opponents. 
Lewandowski could have done better in a couple of half-chances that were denied by a 
confident Osasuna goalkeeper Sergio Herrera, but it was not until the 59th minute that 
Barca came to life and managed to break the deadlock. 
Ilkay Gundogan picked out Lewandowski with a through-ball and the striker scored from close-range. 
However, Osasuna players were left fuming and complained to the referee that Barcelona defender Andreas Christensen had fouled Jose Arnaiz before starting the counter-attack, but a VAR check confirmed the goal. 
After Lewandowski’s goal, Xavi brought Joao Felix off the bench and the Portuguese forward added impetus Barca seemed to lack up-front, forcing goalkeeper Herrera to make a couple of fine saves to keep Osasuna alive. 
Joao Felix created a quick counter and provided the assist to Yamal who blasted low in to the net to secure the win and set-up an El Clasico in the final.

2,Morocco under pressure to repeat World Cup heroics at AFCON,Morocco becomes the first Arab and African country to reach a World Cup semi-final.,"ABIDJAN: Morocco set new standards for African football just over 12 months ago at the Qatar World Cup but the pressure is now on to improve a dismal record in the Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off on Saturday. 
Morocco became the first Arab and African country to reach a World Cup semi-final in their thrilling run that captivated the continent but they are now expected to take that form into the Cup of Nations and expunge a record of consistent failure. 
Morocco are one of 12 countries in the 24-team field who have had previous success in the continental championship but their only past triumph came almost a half century ago in 1976. 
They have a long history since of crashing out unexpectedly when having been cast as favourites. 
“I want to at least get to the semi-finals,” coach Walid Regragui told local television channel Arryadia. 
They are in Group ‘F’ with DR Congo, Zambia and a Tanzania side who have never won a game at the tournament. 
There will many teams eager to scythe them down, particularly a strong challenge from hosts Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and holders Senegal. 
Sadio Mane, who took last weekend off to get married, again headlines a Senegal side that, like Morocco, had success over Brazil in a friendly last year and is bristling with experience and talent. 
They were deserved winners of the last Cup of Nations in Cameroon, albeit needing post-match penalties to overcome Egypt in the final. 
Senegal are in Group ‘C’ with Cameroon, Gambia and the Guinea of Serhou Guirassy, prolific in the German Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart and reportedly fine after an injury scare this week. 
The Ivorians will also be expected to go deep into the tournament, although often the burden of expectation from home supporters can weigh too heavily. 
Egypt in 2006 were the last hosts to win the Cup of Nations, ironically on spot kicks over the Ivory Coast. 
The Ivorians kick off proceedings in Saturday’s opening match in Group ‘A’ against Guinea Bissau at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium at Ebimpe, on the outskirts of the economic capital Abidjan. 
The 60,000-seat stadium was built for a tournament initially supposed to be played in June and July last year to avoid a clash with the middle of the season in Europe, where so many top African players are based. 
However, fears over staging it during the rainy season led to it being pushed back to its more traditional January and February slot. 
Matches will be staged in six stadiums, with two venues in Abidjan, including at Ebimpe, which will host the final. 
Games will also be played in the capital Yamoussoukro and neighbouring Bouake, as well as in San Pedro on the coast and in Korhogo, in the north near the frontiers with Mali and Burkina Faso. 
It is the first AFCON in West Africa since Ghana in 2008, and $1.5 billion has been invested by the Ivorian government. 
Authorities will be hoping to avoid anything like the event that overshadowed the last AFCON in Cameroon, where eight people were killed in a crush and stampede outside Yaounde’s Olembe Stadium. 
Locals are also hoping that their team, the Elephants, can go all the way and claim a third title. The most recognisable face in their squad is Borussia Dortmund striker Sebastien Haller, who appears regularly on billboards lining Abidjan’s traffic-choked streets. 
Nigeria’s squad, spearheaded by African footballer of the year Victor Osimhen, is on paper among their best in years but recent results have been anything but impressive. In November lowly Lesotho held them away in a World Cup qualifier and they also lost last year at home to tiny Guinea Bissau. 
The presence of Napoli striker Osimhen gives Nigerians hope their team can go far but they have been dealt a blow with the loss of Bayer Leverkusen forward Victor Boniface to injury. 
The Super Eagles will play the hosts as well as Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau in Group ‘A’. 
Egypt, with Mohamed Salah again their talisman, and 2019 winners Algeria join Morocco in heading the challenge from Arabic-speaking north Africa, along with Tunisia who are making a record-extending 16th straight appearance at the finals. 
They should have few serious problems getting out of a group also featuring Ghana, Cape Verde and Mozambique. 
Other past winners in this years field are Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Zambia, all of whom have potential to be spoilers. 
South Africa are back after missing the last edition, and their team leans heavily on the country’s leading club side, Mamelodi Sundowns. 
They meet Tunisia, Mali and Namibia in Group ‘E’.

4,Shelton exits Auckland Classic as outsiders reach final,Ben Shelton says he plans to have an  “exciting two weeks” at the Australian Open.,"

BEN Shelton of the US hits a return against Japan’s Taro Daniel during their semi-final at the Auckland Classic on Friday.—AFP

 
AUCKLAND: Ben Shelton says he plans to have an  “exciting two weeks” at the Australian Open after the Auckland Classic top seed suffered a shock semi-final exit Friday.
Unseeded pair Taro Daniel and Alejandro Tabilo set up a final that will feature two players ranked outside the top 70 after upset straight-sets wins.
Japan’s Daniel beat American powerhouse Shelton 7-5, 7-6 (11-9) before Chilean qualifier Tabilo toppled French teenager and sixth seed Arthur Fils 6-2, 7-5.
World number 16 Shelton reached last year’s Australian Open quarter-finals and the last four of the US Open and is seen as a danger man in Melbourne next week.
The 21-year-old said he’ll be ready for the year’s first Grand Slam tournament despite his surprise exit in Auckland.
“Definitely disappointed that my run ended here but I’m going to get over there and get prepared. Hopefully I’ll have an exciting two weeks over there,” said Shelton, who conceded he was too erratic against his 74th-ranked opponent.
“I had a hard time dealing with a lot of the stuff he was throwing at me.
“There were things I didn’t execute at the highest level today that I would have wanted to — a few volleys on top of the net and stuff like that.”
Daniel, 30, suffered two gruelling losses to Shelton last year, including a five-setter in the Wimbledon first round, and was pleased to gain some measure of revenge.
“It’s always difficult to play against Ben because he doesn’t give you much rhythm,” said Daniel, who won his lone career title six years ago.
“It’s all about who can put on more pressure and that tiebreak was such a dogfight.”
Tabilo, seeking his first ATP title, was also able to neutralise his opponent’s power game in hot conditions.
The 26-year-old won his quarter-final by walkover when injured second-seeded Briton Cameron Norrie withdrew.
He proved worthy of a place in the final by frustrating 19-year-old Fils who, at 35th, is the world’s highest-ranked teenager.
Tabilo, ranked 82nd, lost his only other final appearance at the 2022 Cordoba Open in Argentina.
Daniel won his only previous final at the 2018 Istanbul Open.

In the other two matches of the round, Wapda beat Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) by 144 runs, while State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) overcame Khan Research Laboratories by four wickets. 
At the State Bank Stadium, Jahandad ran through the HEC line-up to bundle them out for 197 in their pursuit of a 407-run target.

6,"HBL PSL to start on Feb 17; Lahore gets opener, Karachi to host final",LAHORE: The ninth edition of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) will start here and end in Karachi.,"LAHORE: The ninth edition of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) will start here and end in Karachi. 
The schedule of the franchise T20 tournament was released by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday, finally ending speculations over the starting date, which has been set for Feb. 17.
Defending champions Lahore Qalandars will take on two-time winners Islamabad United in the opener here at the Gaddafi Stadium, which will host nine matches, as many as Rawalpindi’s Pindi Cricket Stadium will do.
Earlier, the PCB had the schedule to start the event from Feb. 8, but since the date has been marked for the long due general elections, the board decided to delay it by nine days after consultation with the caretaker government.
Five matches have been reserved for Multan, while Karachi’s National Bank Stadium will stage 11, including the playoffs — the Qualifier and the two Eliminators — and the Mar. 18 final.
It will be the third time the coastal metropolis will hold the title encounter after hosting it in the 2018 and 2019 editions.
“The decision to host the marquee event across these cities is a testament to our commitment to bring top-notch cricket to fans across the country,” the PCB’s interim Management Committee chairman Zaka Ashraf was quoted as saying in the board’s press release. 
“We believe that hosting matches in these venues not only adds to the excitement for fans but also promotes cricket at the grassroots level. 
“As we gear up for this spectacular event, we look forward to witnessing thrilling action and creating unforgettable moments for cricket enthusiasts worldwide.”
Over the past two to three years, the PCB had been mulling over the possibility of holding matches in Peshawar as well as in Quetta. But prevailing security issues and apparent lack of coordination with cities’ local governments have kept the longstanding ambition from materialising.
The board had organised an exhibition match between Quetta Gladiators and Peshawar Zalmi at the former’s home ground, the Bugti Stadium, and a good number of fans had thronged into the venue, demonstrating the Balochistan capital’s love for cricket.
Four of the six franchises — Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalanadars, Multan Sultans and Islamabad United — will be play five matches each at their respective home grounds. 
Meanwhile, Peshawar Zalmi will play four matches in Rawalpindi, Quetta Gladiators will play three matches each in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi, while they will play one match at the Multan Cricket Stadium against home side Sultans on Feb. 25.
The marquee clashes between Qalandars and Kings are set for Feb. 24 and Mar. 9 at the Gaddafi Stadium and the National Bank Stadium respectively. 
Like the previous edition, the forthcoming PSL season will take place in two legs with Multan and Lahore hosting 14 matches between them from Feb. 17-27. The action will then move to Rawalpindi and Karachi, where 16 matches will be played from Feb 28 to March 12 before the latter hosts the playoffs and the finale.

Lehecka completely dominated proceedings against the American at Memorial Drive, racing through the match in just 73 minutes as he builds towards the Australian Open.
The Czech seventh seed will play Briton Jack Draper, who put out Russian eighth seed Alexander Bublik 7-6 (7-2), 6-4.
“It would mean a lot to win the title,” 2023 Adelaide semi-finalist Draper said, who reached his only tour final in Sofia in November.
“I made my first one back at the end of last season. I hope I can get over the line tomorrow.”
Against Korda, a mistake-free Lehecka telegraphed his intentions from the start with a serve to love then broke in the second game.
Korda, son of 1998 Australian Open champion Petr Korda, was unable to mount any resistance as the 22-year-old Czech surged into only his second career final.
“I’m a bit surprised that it went this well,” Lehecka said.  “But I did all I could to make it happen.
“I’m happy to be looking at a place in the final. I did good work in the off-season and it’s working well.
“But there is one more step so we will see tomorrow,” added Lehecka, whose ranking will improve to a career-best 26.
In the women’s semi-finals, sixth seed Ostapenko beat Russia’s Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-2, 7-6 (7-3), a victory that will propel the Latvian back into the top 10 for the first time in six years when the new rankings are released on Monday.
Currently ranked 12, the former French Open champion will vie for the title against with Russian, Daria Kasatkina, who earned a walkover win when American second seed Jessica Pegula withdrew with illness.
“She can serve big and was hitting great,” 
Ostapenko said of Alexandrova. “But I was just trying to play my game. I’m glad I won in two sets.”

Teeger was cleared of wrong-doing by an independent inquiry established by Cricket South Africa (CSA) last month following comments he made in support of Israeli soldiers at an awards ceremony in October.
The teenager was recognised at the Jewish Achiever Awards and said: “I’m now the rising star, but the true rising stars are the young soldiers in Israel. And I’d like to dedicate it to the state of Israel and every single soldier fighting so that we can live and thrive in the diaspora.”  
The comments drew the ire of the Palestine Solidarity Alliance (PSA), who lodged a complaint with the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee.
Teeger was cleared by the inquiry, but his demotion comes as the South African government has levelled an accusation of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice, and CSA say they fear keeping Teeger as captain could inflame tensions during the event. 
“We have been advised protests related to the Gaza war can be anticipated during the event,” CSA said. “In the circumstances, CSA has decided that David should be relieved of the captaincy for the tournament.”

Israel has killed more than 23,000 people, majority of them civilians including women and children, in its more than three-month-old offensive, according to Palestinian health authorities in the Hamas-ruled enclave.
“For us, the message we are here to deliver through football is to qualify for the second round because Palestine and its people want to live. This is what we can offer,” midfielder Oday Kharoub told Reuters on Thursday.
The 26-member squad play Asian powerhouse Iran on Sunday followed by the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, hoping to advance to the knockout stage.
Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after a cross-border rampage on Oct 7 by Hamas militants in which Israeli officials said 1,200 people were killed, mainly civilians, and 240 taken hostage back to Gaza.
Kharoub said it has been difficult for players, especially those with families in Gaza, to focus on training when their eyes are glued to the news between sessions, keenly following what is happening back home.
“Our hearts are with them and we can only pray for them,” Kharoub said.  “Inshallah, we can make them happy, even if it’s just a little bit, by qualifying for the next round. This is our ambition.”
Defender Mousa Farawi said they have steeled themselves to play in high spirits despite the situation in Gaza.
“The group we have is really special, so we hope for God to give us good fortune and give each player the bravery to deliver on a high level. I see Palestine in the second round, God willing.”
Defender Yaser Hamed said:  “The whole team is motivated with what’s happening in Palestine, it’s a difficult time for all families. But we’re professional players, we should keep it up the same way as we’ve been working in the last few weeks.”
Israel were once Asian Cup champions when they hosted the tournament in 1964. But amid political tension and boycotts by Middle East nations, Israel made the switch to European confederation UEFA in 1994.

Elgar ended his time as a South Africa player earlier this month after 86 Tests with over 5,000 runs.
His final international appearance last week saw him captaining the Proteas who crashed to a seven-wicket defeat against India in Cape Town. He was an English Cou­nty Champi­onship winner with Surrey in 2018 and has also represented Some­rset with whom he had been linked again this time.
He will fill the void at Essex left by the retirement of former England captain Alastair Cook at the end of last season.

Put in charge of the squad ahead of the T20 World Cup in June, Shaheen claimed three wickets and promoted himself in the batting order but New Zealand still went 1-0 up in the five-match series.
Put into bat, New Zealand racked up 226-8 with Daryl Mitchell hitting 61 off 27 balls and skipper Kane Williamson making a brisk 57.
New Zealand’s boundary-laden innings was the highest Pakistan had conceded in a T20, surpassing the 221-3 England scored in Karachi in 2022.
The hosts built on an explosive start from opener Finn Allen (34), who struck 24 runs off the third over, bowled by Shaheen. Pakistan’s new-look attack struggled to protect the ground’s notoriously short boundaries, conceding 21 fours and 11 sixes.
Seamer Abbas Afridi impressed in his first international appearance in any format with 3-34 off four overs, although fellow-debutant Usama Mir had his leg spin attacked by Mitchell in particular and finished with 0-51.
Babar Azam anchored Pakistan’s chase for a while but Tim Southee led New Zealand’s disciplined bowling, which was aided by their sharp catching.
Southee became the first player to 150 wickets in T20Is as the veteran seam bowler claimed four victims to pass the milestone and help dismiss the tourists for 180 in the 18th over in response to New Zealand’s imposing total.
The right-armer’s figures of 4-25 were the best of a run-dominated encounter at Eden Park and took him to 151 wickets in T20 internationals, 11 more than Bangladesh spinner Shakib Al Hasan.

He finished the job as Pakistan’s run chase capitulated after Babar fell in the 17th over, with the former captain having accelerated to 57 off 35 balls to keep his side in contention.
There were starts for openers Saim Ayub (27) and Mohammad Rizwan (25) but Babar struggled to find support from his team-mates before being caught at cover by captain Kane Williamson off Ben Sears’ bowling. Shaheen promoted himself to number seven but the ploy did not work as he fell for a duck.
Williamson said Southee’s value across a 16-year career couldn’t be understated. 
“Tim has been around for a long time and this is a credit to his consistent performances over a long period,” he said. “But he also adds so much as a leader in our environment — a calm head and it’s pretty good to have him out there with some young nasty fasties.” 
Shaheen, who took 3-46, led Pakistan for the first time after Babar forfeited the captaincy in the wake of their failure to make last year’s 50-over Cricket World Cup semi-finals. Hesaid improvements will be necessary ahead of the second match in Hamilton on Sunday. 
“We only have a short time. As a bowling unit, we have to improve and use our variations at the right times,” he said. “Kane Williamson and Mitchell played very well but there were mis-fields in the middle overs. We have to grab those catches and as a fielding unit we need to do better.” 
New Zealand spinner Mitch Santner sat out after testing positive for COVID-19, the team said. Santner has been in isolation at the team’s Auckland hotel and will travel solo home to Hamilton.

12,Gamble pays off for Loeb with victory in stage six of Dakar Rally,SHUBAYTAH: Sebastien Loeb’s decision to ‘go slow’ in stage five earlier in the week paid off on Friday as the...,"SHUBAYTAH: Sebastien Loeb’s decision to ‘go slow’ in stage five earlier in the week paid off on Friday as the Fren­chman won the marathon two-day stage six at the Dakar Rally.
Veteran Spaniard Carlos Sainz finished second 2min 01sec behind and took the overall lead while five-time winner Nasser Al-Attiyah saw his hopes of winning a sixth title disappear with a mechanical problem in the last 50 kilometres.
Adrien van Beveren made it a double French success with victory in the bike race.
Loeb, a nine-time world rally champion, deliberately lost time on Wednesday so that he would not have to open the road on the virgin dunes at the start of the an unprecedented two-day marathon around Shubaytah — a 780km loop in the kingdom’s vast Empty Quarter with more than 600km of specials for motorcycles and nearly 550km for cars.
Loeb, who has yet to win a Dakar Rally, started Friday’s second part of the stage in third place, 37min behind Sainz, but carved his way through the dunes to claim his second stage win of the rally, having also taken stage four.
“The strategy was the right one,” said the Prodrive competitor who has moved up to third in the standings 29min 31sec behind Sainz.
“It was a good day for us, a good stage with no problems. It was very long, so the first part of the stage yesterday (Thursday) was more than 400km. I tried to take it a bit easy for the car especially and not to be too hard on the car.
“I knew that it would be very hard mechanically for it to go through so many kilometres in the dunes.
“Today, there were 150km left so I tried to push harder on this one, to get a good time and that’s what we did. So, there have been no problems at all for us with this long stage.
“For the second week we’ll have to continue to find the right rhythm.
“If you have any mistakes on just one stage you lose a lot of time and you are far behind, so we need to be consistent until the end.”
The 61-year-old three-time Dakar winner Sainz showed the value of experience as he brought his Audi home safely in second place gaining over eight minutes on his team-mate Mattias Ekstrom of Sweden, who is second in the standings 20min 21sec behind the veteran.
“It was quite a difficult stage, but I think we managed to do a good job,” said Sainz.
“If you asked before this week ‘would we be leading?’ I would say I am happy. But there is still a long way to go. It’s still very open.”
The unforgiving nature of the terrain, however, claimed another victim as Al-Attiyah became the third big gun in two days to kiss his hopes goodbye.
Thursday had seen the end of Saudi Yazeed Al-Rajhi, overall leader at the time, who rolled his Toyota and ‘Mr Dakar’ — 14-time winner Stephane Peterhansel — who suffered a hydraulic failure that prevented him from using the jack to change a wheel.
Al-Attiyah avoided retiring in spite of breaking his steering by finishing the stage 2hr 45min behind his team-mate Loeb and will now focus on helping the Frenchman to a first overall victory.
“We’ll try to keep going and we’ll see what we can do,” said the Qatari. “Everything is not finished. I will try to help Seb, to be behind him. At least he can win this Dakar. I will do my best for him to win because we are a team.”
In the bike category, van Beveren (Honda) took his fourth Dakar stage win since his first appearance in 2016.
He finished 4min 13sec ahead of Australian Toby Price (KTM) and 5min 2sec in front of the American Ricky Brabec (Honda), who has taken the overall lead from Ross Branch (Hero), albeit only by a slender 51sec.
Van Beveren is third overall, 9min 21sec behind team-mate Brabec.
Saturday sees the competitors taking a well-earned rest day in Riyadh, their only day off in the rally, before resuming on Sunday with stage seven which includes a 483km special as they head to Al-Duwadimi.
