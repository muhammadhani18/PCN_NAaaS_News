0,"Both PTI, SC face 'real test' today",Fate of party's internal elections hangs in balance,"Saturday (today) is crucial for the PTI as a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, will decide the fate of its intra-party elections.
If the apex court declares that the PTI's internal polls were not held in accordance with the law, the party will suffer a major setback by not being allotted its cherished electoral symbol of the ‘cricket bat’.
Surprisingly, the Peshawar High Court in its short order did not give the declaration that the PTI's intra-party elections were held in accordance with the law.
The SC bench also expressed its surprise that the short order failed to mention this crucial aspect.
Makhdoom Ali Khan, the counsel for the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), pointed out several legal flaws in the holding of the PTI's intra-party polls.
The SC bench has yet to clearly make up its mind about its decision in this matter.
Now it is a major test for the PTI’s legal team as to how it can defend the party’s internal elections before the SC bench on Saturday. Usually, the benches do not sit for a hearing on Saturdays.
Questions are also being raised on the performance of the PTI lawyers, who appeared to be struggling before the bench led by CJP Isa.
Advocate Ali Zafar is likely to represent the PTI on Saturday.
The factor of perception is more important in this case.  It is an open secret there is a clash between the ‘powerful circles' and PTI since the May 9 violence last year.
Despite facing tough times, the PTI's popularity has not decreased and the party’s opponents do not want its renowned electoral symbol to be allotted to it.
Following this perception, the matter is also important for CJP Isa, who has so far been successful in adjudicating important cases during his tenure.
The elections date was announced after the SC's intervention. The court overturned a couple of high courts’ orders, which might have delayed the polls.
However, it is a key test for the SC as to how it will ensure the credibility of the elections.
Lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed said the SC’s fundamental rights jurisprudence truly took off after former premier
Benazir Bhutto’s petition in 1988 seeking an electoral symbol for the PPP (and her earlier plea against non-party polls).
""It will be very unfortunate if the SC allowed the ECP to deny the [cricket] bat symbol to the PTI,” he added.

3,Elahi out of election fray as appeal dismissed,LHC permits PTI leader’s wife to contest elections,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Saturday dismissed an appeal by PTI President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi against an earlier rejection of his papers by the returning officer, resulting in his exclusion from the upcoming general elections.
The court, however, granted permission to his wife, Qaisara Elahi, to contest the polls.
An LHC bench led by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi heard the appeals of Elahi, Qaisara, and their son Moonis Elahi against the rejection of their nomination papers.
Elahi's lawyer, Shahzad Shoukat, maintained that his client had been accused of hiding the facts in the nomination papers.
""The accusations include not mentioning a licence for seven weapons and the absence of a mention of a special account in the nomination papers.""
The lawyer emphasized, ""According to the law, everything is stated in the papers, and an attempt has been made to snatch the nomination papers.”
He stated that Elahi was a senior politician and should be allowed to contest the elections.
""They arrested their appointed representative when he went to submit the nomination papers,"" the lawyer said while responding to queries from Justice Najafi.
Justice Najafi questioned if it ""is the responsibility of the ECP to issue timely orders? Did you file any complaint with the ECP?""
The lawyer said, ""We approached the court, and after the court orders, we were allowed to go to the RO office.""
Subsequently, the court announced its verdict and rejected Elahi's appeal.
Previously, the LHC directed the regional police officer of Gujranwala, along with the district police officers of Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin, to adhere strictly to legal protocols, emphasising that they must not impede Qaisara from submitting nomination papers for the elections before the relevant officers.
Qaisara contended that she, her husband Elahi, and son Moonis intended to contest the forthcoming general elections scheduled for Feb 8.
To facilitate the submission of their nomination papers, authorised individuals were appointed to represent them before the ROs of the respective constituencies.
However, Qaisara claimed that the authorised individuals were facing obstruction from the Punjab police, including illegal abduction.
Meanwhile, a three-member LHC bench, headed by Justice Najafi, was expected to announce the reserved decisions on writ petitions filed by PTI's Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Sanam Javed, and others against the verdicts of the appellate election tribunals on Sunday (today).
The PTI's contestants had challenged decisions of the ROs before the election appellate tribunals. Later, they had challenged the tribunals’ verdicts through writ petitions before the LHC

5,PML-N to give Talal Senate ticket,Sanaullah tells him he has not been ignored,"The PML-N has decided to give a Senate ticket to Talal Chaudhry for his unwavering support for the party in difficult times.
According to sources, PML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah conveyed the party leadership’s decision to Talal.
Sanaullah informed Talal that the party had chosen him for a slot in the upper house of parliament.
In a conversation with Talal, Sanaullah said his contribution and sacrifices played a major role in the ouster of the “anti-people” government.
He continued the PML-N appreciated his sacrifices and love, which the party could never forget.
According to the sources, Sanaullah told Talal that not giving him a National Assembly ticket did not mean the party had ignored him but decided to make him a senator.
The PML-N has announced the names of its candidates for seats in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures for the next general elections.
However, the party’s important leaders including Daniyal Aziz and Talal Chaudhry were not given a ticket for any seat of these seats.
On August 2, 2023, the five-year disqualification period of both the PML-N leaders had come to an end.
On August 2, 2018, the Supreme Court had handed down the sentence to both Daniyal and Talal in a contempt of court case.
The then premier Shehbaz Sharif had congratulated both Talal and Daniyal on the conclusion of their sentences in a social media post.
""The darkness of negative actions taken by enemies of Pakistan's prosperity and progress during the past years is dissipating,” the premier wrote on X (formerly Twitter).
""I extend my appreciation to those leaders of PML-N who stood firm alongside the party and its supreme leader, Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, despite the hardships, and remained steadfast,"" he added.
PMLN Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz Sharif said the party was proud of Talal.
“Courage and conviction do not always roar, sometimes they’re personified by people like you. You stand tall.
Taller than those who victimised you. They are relegated to the dustbins of ugly history while you are the present and the future, Insha’Allah,” she wrote on X.
The sources said the party leadership had decided that former party MPA, Malik Muhammad Nawaz, would be chosen for the slot of the Faisalabad mayor.
