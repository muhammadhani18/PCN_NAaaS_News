0,Vast network of lost ancient cities found in Amazon,The site was long hidden by the jungle in the Upano valley on the foothills of the Andes mountain range in eastern Ecuador.,"PARIS: Archaeologists have discovered the largest and oldest network of pre-Hispanic cities ever found in the Amazon rainforest, revealing a 2,500-year-old lost civilisation of farmers.
The vast site, which covers more than 1,000 square kilometres, was long hidden by the jungle in the Upano valley on the foothills of the Andes mountain range in eastern Ecuador.
However, a French-led team of researchers have used laser-mapping technology taken from above, as well as archaeological excavations, to uncover 20 settlements — including five large cities — connected by roads.
Stephen Rostain, an archaeologist at France’s CNRS research centre and the lead author of a new study, said  was like discovering “El Dorado”.
The scale of this urban development — which includes earthen homes, ceremonial buildings and agricultural draining — has never been seen before in the Amazon, Rostain said.
“It is not just a village, but an entire landscape that has been domesticated,” he said.
Rostain said he detected the first traces of this lost civilisation 25 years ago, when he spotted hundreds of mounds in the area.
In 2015, his team of researchers flew over the region using laser technology called Lidar, which allowed the scientists to peer through the forest canopy as  “if we had cut down all the trees,” Rostain said.
‘Like New York’ 
They found more than 6,000 earthen mounds, rectangular earthen platforms which served as the base of homes for the  “Upano people”.
On the floors, the researchers found  “all the domestic remains one would see in a home — fireplaces, large ceramic jars for beer made out of corn, grinding stones, seeds, tools,” Rostain said.
Remarkably, the cities are all criss-crossed by large, straight streets —  “just like in New York,” he added.
Some cities have a large central alley where people from the surrounding villages gathered, Rostain said, comparing these streets to those of the ancient Teotihuacan city in modern-day Mexico.
Rostain speculated that several thousand people could have attended such ceremonial events, though further analysis is being carried out to estimate how many people lived in the region.

1,EU weighs proposal to send naval mission to Red Sea,Spain backs out and says that it will not take part in any EU naval mission in the Red Sea.,"BRUSSELS: The European Union will discuss next week a plan to set up a naval mission to help protect Red Sea shipping , diplomats said on Friday.
The proposal _ in the pipeline in Brussels for several weeks _ was mooted before US and British forces struck Yemen early on Friday.
Any EU effort would seek to complement a US-led coalition, which includes numerous countries from the bloc, which is already operating in the vital shipping route.
The details of the size and scope of any EU mission remain to be hammered out and European diplomats said a first discussion would take place in Brussels on Tuesday.
Spain said on Friday that it would not take part in any EU naval mission in the Red Sea.
Its defence minister, Margarita Robles, said that “Spain’s position on this subject has always been clear”.
The EU last year initially mulled a plan to expand its  Atalanta mission focused on protecting shipping off Somalia, but that move was blocked by Spain.
Madrid gave no official reason, but Spanish media reported that domestic politics was behind the refusal, with a hard-left partner in Spain’s governing coalition, the Sumar party, generally opposed to US foreign policy.
Diplomats said EU foreign ministers could strike an agreement on establishing the new naval mission at the coming meeting in Brussels.
The Houthis, who have seized control of a major portion of Yemen since a civil war erupted in the country in 2014, are part of a regional Iran-backed “axis of resistance” against Israel and its allies.
The pre-dawn air strikes by the United States and Britain add to escalating fears of wider conflict in the region.
The strikes targeted an airbase, airports and a military camp, the Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV station said, with correspondents and witnesses reporting they could hear heavy strikes in Hodeida and Sanaa.
Tanker firm
Danish tanker firm Torm said on Friday it was halting all transit through the southern Red Sea, following attacks from Yemen’s Houthis and retaliatory strikes in Yemen by the US and UK.
“Torm decided today to pause all transits through the southern Red Sea until further notice,” a Torm spokeswoman said in an email, adding the company had no further comments at the time.
The Danish company owns a fleet of around 80 vessels and specialises in the transportation of petroleum products.
The company’s announcement came in the wake of a growing number of attacks by Houthis on Israeli-linked shipping in the key Red Sea international trade route since Oct 7.
Early on Friday morning, US and British forces launched air strikes in Houthi-held areas in Yemen, adding to escalating fears of a wider conflict in the region.
The targeting of ships has caused several shipping companies, including Denmark’s Maersk, to divert around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, affecting trade flows at a time when supply strains are putting upward pressure on inflation globally.
Some 12 per cent of global maritime trade normally passes through the Bab Al Mandeb strait, but since mid-November the amount of shipping containers has dropped by 70 per cent, according to maritime experts.

2,IS under pressure after Gaza crisis,"Since the start of the Gaza crisis, IS has sought to tap into sympathy for Palestinians.","PARIS: The Hamas raid in Israel may have taken the limelight from the militant Islamic State group, but the fighters are seeking to capitalise on anger over the bombardment of Gaza to rally followers, analysts say.
“Without the Gaza war, IS would get the headlines,” said Hans-Jakob Schindler, director of the Counter Extremism Project think tank.
“It puts considerable pressure on IS to remain relevant.” Both groups are described as “terrorist” by Israel and the West, but they have very different agendas.
Hamas, which is backed by Iran, presents itself as defending the Palestinian people against the Israeli occupation since 1948.
Staunchly Sunni, IS is against Iran and focused on trying to revive its project of a global Islamic caliphate, after losing the territory it held in Syria and Iraq between 2014 and 2019.
Several fronts 
But its supporters are also against Israel and any “global Jewish project”, said Laurence Bindner, co-founder of the JOS Project, which analyses extremist propaganda.
“In the Middle East, the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend,” she said.
“The IS has positioned itself simultaneously on several fronts: one against Jews and those who support Israel and another against Iran and their allies.”
Earlier this month, IS claimed an attack in Iran that killed 89 people gathered to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the killing of storied Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.
Since the start of the Gaza crisis, IS has sought to tap into sympathy for Palestinians.
Late in October, IS in its Al Naba propaganda magazine published a text, “Practical Ways to Support Muslims in Palestine”, urging followers to attack Israel, its Western backers and all Jews worldwide.
Earlier this month, the group’s spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfah Al Ansari, posted a recording titled “And kill them wherever you find them”.

3,Israel-Qatar deal on medicines  for prisoners,The families of prisoners have launched a high-profile campaign for the government to ramp up efforts to get them freed.,"JERUSALEM: Israel negotiated a deal with Qatar to get medicines through to prisoners still being held in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli prime minister’s office said on Friday.
The deal “will allow the entry of medicines for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza”, Benjamin Netan­yahu’s office said in a statement.
Around 250 prisoners were seized by Hamas during the raid in southern Israel on Oct 7, 132 of whom remain in captivity, although 25 of those are believed to have been killed, according to Israeli figures.
The families of prisoners have launched a high-profile campaign for the government to ramp up efforts to get them freed.
On Tuesday, the campaign group Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a report saying the captives were in poor health, some with complex illnesses, others with injuries. “All hostages are in great danger and have no time to waste,” they said in their report.

Austin has been hospitalised since Jan 1 for complications from prostate cancer treatment, but did not inform the White House or Congress for several days after he was admitted, sparking calls for him to leave office and raising questions about how significant a role he is playing on national security issues.
“He was fully engaged even from his hospital bed,” National Security Council spokesman 
John Kirby told MSNBC, adding that Austin “was involved actively and intimately all day yesterday with the national security team here at the White House and of course with the commander-in-chief, with President Biden”.

5,S. Arabia in ‘tight spot’ as West takes on Houthis,A poll published showed 96 percent of Saudis think Arab countries should sever all contacts with Israel “in protest against its military action in Gaza”.,"RIYADH: The US and British strikes in Yemen have set off alarm bells in Saudi Arabia, which craves de-escalation in its war-torn neighbour so it can focus on domestic reforms, analysts said.
Explosions lit up the night sky early on Friday as the United States and Britain pounded scores of targets with more than 100 precision-guided munitions.
The strikes came in response to weeks of attacks on Red Sea shipping by the Houthis, who control northern Yemen and say they are firing on Israel-linked ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
Saudi Arabia has led an anti-Houthi coalition since 2015 — launching thousands of air strikes of its own against the Houthis over the years — but is now angling for a ceasefire and military exit from the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest nation.
Even as the scale of the US and British strikes was still coming into focus before dawn on Friday, the Saudi foreign ministry published a statement expressing “great concern” and calling for “self-restraint and avoiding escalation”.
Anna Jacobs, senior Gulf analyst for the International Crisis Group think tank, said Saudi Arabia found itself “in a tight spot”.
“They are balancing record-low public opinion about the US and Israel with their security concerns about the Red Sea and their desire to deter further Houthi attacks,” she said.
Weary of war 
Hamas’s unprecedented raid in Israel on Oct 7 and Israel’s withering military response have scuppered Saudi Arabia’s hopes for sustained peace in the region, which officials see as crucial for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s sweeping Vision 2030 agenda for economic and social reform.
The Red Sea coast is a linchpin of the vision, with developers eyeing a slew of resorts that could help transform the once closed-off country into a tourism hot spot.
That makes ending military operations in Yemen a central foreign policy goal for Riyadh, one officials hoped would be more feasible in the wake of a surprise China-brokered rapprochement deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran announced in March.
Just last month, the UN special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, described progress towards a roadmap that would finally resolve outstanding issues such as paying public sector salaries and resuming oil exports.
The most important achievement would be a nationwide ceasefire, building on a truce that first took effect in April 2022 and has largely held despite officially expiring after six months.
But the spate of Huthi attacks — 27 in total, according to the White House — on ships passing through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, the Red Sea’s southern gateway, has complicated that process.
Washington, Saudi Arabia’s most important security partner, announced last month a maritime security initiative, Operation Prosperity Guardian, to secure the Red Sea and which it says brings together 20 countries.
Saudi Arabia hosted about 2,700 US troops as of 2022, according to the White House, underscoring the danger, however remote, of retaliatory strikes on Saudi soil.
No choice
Riyadh has not signed on to Operation Prosperity Guardian, a decision vindicated by Friday’s strikes, said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the government.
“I think Saudi Arabia had no choice but to stay out of the operation given its peace talks with Yemen, but Saudi Arabia is concerned about navigation also, so it’s a difficult position to be in,” he said.
Though Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, leaders pay close attention to public opinion, which could further influence Riyadh’s actions as the Gaza and the Red Sea crises evolve.
A rare poll published last month by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy showed 96 percent of Saudis think Arab countries should sever all contacts with Israel  “in protest against its military action in Gaza”.
Given Washington’s steadfast support for Israel, it is therefore hard to imagine Saudi Arabia would want to involve itself in specific American military operations in the months to come.
Riyadh also remembers well how the US resisted going after the Houthis in recent years when Saudi vessels were under attack.
“They now see the US going ahead with (strikes) at a very inopportune moment for regional stability,” said Cinzia Bianco of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
“They clearly can see the double standards when Israel is at stake, or when they are at stake -- how the US reacts radically differently.” In a statement on Friday, US President Joe Biden said he would “not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary” — raising the spectre of more strikes and, potentially, more risk of Saudi entanglement.
“Everything really is coming together,” said Shihabi, the Saudi analyst.
“It’s a cause of concern, absolutely.”

6,"Beijing wants closer ties with Europe, says Xi","“In the face of the chaotic international situation, it is necessary to build more bridges between China and Europe,” Xi says.","SHANGHAI: China is willing to strengthen relations with Europe, President Xi Jinping said on Friday, at a meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo in Beijing. 
De Croo arrived in China on Thursday, attending the inauguration of the new Belgian embassy in Beijing and meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the same day. 
“China is willing to work with the European Union to promote steady progress in China-EU relations in the new year,” Xi told De Croo when the two men met on Friday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, according to a readout by state broadcaster CCTV. 
“In the face of the chaotic international situation, it is necessary to build more bridges between China and Europe,” Xi said, adding that the two sides should “jointly promote world peace, stability and prosperity”. 
Beijing and the EU are major trade partners but the bloc has recently signalled a desire to reduce reliance on China in technology and other areas. 
The EU has launched an enquiry into China’s subsidies for homegrown EV makers after accusations that their cheap products undercut European competitors — claims denied by Beijing. 
And deteriorating ties between China and the West in recent years have given rise to concerns in Brussels over the potential vulnerabilities posed by AI, misinformation, and data security.

7,"Mass killer Breivik should stay in jail, Norway court told","OSLO: Anders Behring Breivik, the far-right fanatic who killed 77 people in twin attacks in Norway in 2011, remains...","OSLO: Anders Behring Breivik, the far-right fanatic who killed 77 people in twin attacks in Norway in 2011, remains “very dangerous” and should be kept in isolation in prison, a court heard on Friday.
The 44-year-old is suing the Norwegian state in a bid to end his years of isolation in prison and lift restrictions on his correspondence with the outside world. 
He has been held in isolation ever since he killed eight people with a car bomb in Oslo and gunned down 69 others, most of them teenagers, on Utoeya island.
Andreas Hjetland, representing the justice ministry, said in his closing argument on Friday “there is no ground for the allegation that Breivik’s human rights are being violated”.
“Breivik remains very dangerous,” he told the court.  “There is still a great danger he can commit violence or that he can inspire others (to commit violence).”  
As in previous days, Breivik shook his head in disagreement at several of the points Hjetland made.
Breivik had the possibility to make short remarks at the close of the hearing. He chose not to.
Lisbeth Roeyneland, whose 18-year-old daughter, Synne, was murdered by Breivik at Utoeya and who followed the hearing this week, said she expected Breivik to lose his case.
“He has shown no regret,” she said, speaking at an Oslo courtroom where the case was broadcast. For security reasons, the hearing took place in Breivik’s prison.
“He whispered that he was sorry for what he did without feelings nor empathy. But when he talks about himself, the body language is in place and he can press out a few crocodile tears.”

8,Snow buries Iowa campaigning,White House hopeful Ron DeSantis and his rival Nikki Haley both postponed multiple campaign events.,"DES MOINES: A powerful storm that could strengthen into a so-called bomb cyclone pummeled northern and central parts of the United States on Friday, with heavy snow derailing campaigning for the important Iowa caucus.
Several inches of snow were set to accumulate in the midwest US state, where Republican presidential candidates are seeking support in Monday’s caucus vote — the first of this year’s White House race.
“Travel may become impossible in rural areas by this afternoon. Hazardous travel to continue through Saturday across much of central Iowa,” the weather service warned on Friday.
“Dangerous cold temperatures will accompany this storm, adding an extra layer of risk to travel.” 
White House hopeful Ron DeSantis and his rival Nikki Haley both postponed multiple campaign events on Friday.
The storm is forecast to become stronger, dumping snow across the midwest and also threatening severe thunderstorms across the south, while CNN said an Arctic blast starting on Friday night in the northern plains could bring temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (-34 degrees Celsius).
Chicago’s busy O’Hare international airport was closed from early Friday morning due to snow and ice, with hundreds of flights cancelled across the region.
The storm comes on the heels of severe cold weather that slammed much of the United States earlier in the week, causing several deaths and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.

9,Sunak pledges extra $3.2bn for Ukraine on Kyiv visit,KYIV: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday announced 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn) in new military aid for...,"KYIV: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday announced 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn) in new military aid for Ukraine, saying it sent a “strong signal” of support for the war-torn nation.
The funding package for the coming year is 200 million pounds higher than the 2.3bn pledged per year in both 2022 and 2023.
It will ensure the “largest-ever commitment of drones”, Sunak’s office said in a statement upon arrival in Ukraine’s capital.
The British prime minister said the aid was designed “to send a strong signal of support to the Ukrainian people”.
Russian President Vladimir Putin “needs to recognise we’re not going anywhere”, he added.
“I’m here with one clear message: the United Kingdom stands with Ukraine,” he said after touring damaged buildings in the Ukrainian capital.
Sunak met emergency service workers responding to the aftermath of Russian air strikes and praised Ukrainians’  “great courage”.
The British leader was set to sign a “historic” security cooperation pact with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while in Kyiv, his office said.
The “totemic agreement” should be the first step towards an “unshakeable hundred-year partnership”, it added.
‘Seriousness of the situation’ 
At least 200m pounds of the latest aid package is to be spent on “a major push to rapidly procure and produce thousands of military drones for Ukraine, including surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones”.
Sunak said the aid currently in place was due to run through to the “early part of this year”.
“So we’re acting in advance of that expiring with a new commitment of two and a half billion pounds — more than we’ve provided in previous years,” he told reporters.
“That represents the seriousness of the situation here and our determination to stand with Ukraine,” he added.
The latest commitment takes the UK’s overall support for Ukraine’s war efforts to almost 12bn pounds.
The equipment already supplied to Kyiv includes Storm Shadow cruise missiles and a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron vowed, during a surprise visit to Kyiv in November, to maintain military support for Ukraine.
Zelensky said at the time that the flow of vital artillery ammunition from Western allies had dropped since the start of the Gaza crisis in October.
“We will continue to give you the moral support, diplomatic support, the economic support, but above all, the military support, that you need not just this year, and next year, but for however long it takes,” Cameron said during a meeting with Zelensky in November.
A top Ukrainian commander recently described the war as a stalemate, with no clear sign of a breakthrough on the front lines.

The UN-contracted chopper, carrying nine passengers,  was conducting an air medical evacuation when a technical problem forced it to make an emergency landing near Hindhere village, an area controlled by Al Shabaab. 
One security source and another person familiar with the matter said four Ukrainians were on the helicopter as crew members.
Somalia’s government said on Thursday it was working to rescue hostages, but military officers warned that such attempts would be difficult in an area they said has been under the Al Qaeda-affiliated group’ control for more than a decade.
An internal UN memo said one passenger had allegedly been killed, while six were taken hostage by Al Shabaab. Two people fled and their whereabouts are not known, it said.
The Ukrainian government has not commented on the issue.

11,Anti-migrant deputy PM claims ‘useful service’ for Italy at trial,"PALERMO: A defiant Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, defended his hard line against illegal...","PALERMO: A defiant Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, defended his hard line against illegal migration in court on Friday, saying he had done a  “useful service” in blocking migrants from disembarking at an Italian port in 2019.
Salvini, a partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s coalition, is on trial on charges of deprivation of liberty and abuse of office for keeping 147 migrants at sea for several weeks on a ship operated by the Open Arms charity.
The Aug 2019 blockade, which occurred while Salvini was interior minister in a previous government, made global headlines and drew condemnation from humanitarian groups.
“What I did I did in full consciousness, I’m not inclined to offload my responsibility onto others. I believe I’ve done a useful service for the country,” he told the court in Palermo, Sicily. Salvini, also head of the League party, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted in the trial, which began in Oct 2021.
A populist known for an “Italians first” policy, the 50-year-old has repeatedly used attacks against illegal immigration to boost his political capital. In 2019, serving under prime minister Giuseppe Conte, he implemented a “closed ports” policy under which Italy refused entry to charity ships that rescue migrants stranded while crossing the Mediterranean.
He cast it as a tough measure against traffickers who operate boats between North Africa and Italy, the deadliest migrant crossing in the world.
In court on Friday, Salvini read from a series of official emails and documents, seeking to demonstrate how the entire Conte government was behind the migration policy.
At the time of the blockade, the League leader had been trying to unseat Conte, triggering a crisis in which Salvini himself left the government weeks later.
Conte has previously testified in the trial that he tried to “exercise moral suasion” with Salvini, saying he considered that “the decision to keep them onboard had no legal basis”.
Dire conditions 
The ship was stuck at sea for nearly three weeks before the migrants were finally allowed to disembark on the island of Lampedusa following a court order. Members of Open Arms have testified that the migrants’  physical and mental well-being reached a crisis point. Four desperate passengers jumped into the water as sanitary conditions onboard became dire, including a scabies outbreak.
Salvini testified that, at the time, he understood that “the situation was not at risk” onboard the ship.
And he claimed his policy delivered “results as never achieved before or since, not only in terms of fighting human trafficking but above all in terms of lives saved”.
He told the court that migrant landings fell by 90 per cent under the policy, introduced while Salvini was minister between mid-2018 and mid-2019, and that migrant deaths fell by half. Interior ministry figures show that around 120,000 migrants arrived on Italy’s shores in 2017, around 23,400 in 2018 and 11,500 in 2019.
But migrant flows are influenced by many factors, including the political situation in North African nations from where many boats set off.
Data from the UN’s migration agency shows that 2,337 migrants died or went missing across the entire Mediterranean in 2018 — not just in the waters off Italy —  compared to 1,885 in 2019, 1,449 in 2020 and 2,048 in 2021.
European pressure 
Salvini has long complained that Italy takes in a disproportionate share of migrants compared to its European neighbours — as has Meloni, who took office in Oct 2022.
Questioned by lawyers for civil parties in the case, Salvini said the Conte government had a policy of allowing migrants to 
disembark only once Italy had a guarantee from other EU countries that they would accept them.
He said it “was a form of pressure” on European nations:  “First the redistribution, then the landing, was absolutely the line of conduct of the government.”

12,Boeing’s blowout forces travellers to check plane model before trips,Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun tells staff he and many customers had been “shaken to the bone”.,"NEW YORK: More travellers are checking the model of an aircraft before booking flights after a midair cabin blowout forced a new Alaska Airlines-operated Boeing jet to make an emergency landing and grounded more than 170 planes, several travel operators said.
A piece of fuselage tore off the left side of the 737 MAX 9 jetliner operated by Alaska Airlines as it climbed following takeoff last Friday, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.
Regulators have since grounded 171 737 MAX 9 planes for safety checks while Alaska and United Airlines, which together have 70 per cent of the 737 MAX 9 fleet, have cancelled hundreds of flights this week.
The Alaska crew have been praised for swiftly landing the plane, with only minor injuries to those on board.
But photos on social media showing oxygen masks deployed and a portion of the aircraft’s side wall missing, as well as provisional checks turning up loose bolts in some grounded planes, stirred concerns it would dent passenger confidence in Boeing planes.
Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun on Tuesday acknowledged mistakes and told staff he and many customers had been  “shaken to the bone”. Boeing must work to earn their confidence, he said.
On Thursday, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said passengers had not shown any concern about flying on Boeing 737 aircraft since the grounding.
Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers is one of Boeing’s largest customers and operates different variants of the 737 MAX from the type that has been grounded.
“We see no indication of any passenger concern ... not one passenger,” O’Leary said, adding that the biggest threat to the MAX came when it was grounded for nearly two years in 2019 following two crashes.
Even so, Booking Holdings-owned Kayak said it has seen a spike in the use of a filter on its website that allows customers to screen by plane model following last week’s incident.
It has moved the filter up on its website to make it more prominent and added the ability to check specifically for the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models. MAX 8 aircraft are still in service.
Internova Travel Group, which represents more than 100,000 travel advisers worldwide, has also seen more queries about plane models.
“The consumer who is aware of the situation is asking our agents, `is this an impacted plane?’ said Peter Vlitas, an executive at the company.
