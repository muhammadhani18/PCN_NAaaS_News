4,PHC orders immediate release of PTI lawyer,Begins contempt proceedings against police over Aftab Alam’s detention; next hearing on Jan 18.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Friday ordered Peshawar police to immediately free PTI lawyer and election candidate from Kohat district Aftab Alam and turned a habeas corpus petition against his arrest from the court’s premises into a contempt plea against the relevant police officials.
Expressing annoyance over the capital police’s act of whisking away Mr Alam from the high court’s premises, a bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Wiqar Ahmad ordered Peshawar superintendent of police (Saddar Circle) Abdul Salam and station house officer of the East Cantonment police station Asif Khan to submit their separate replies to the contempt petition within a week.
It fixed the next hearing for Jan 18.
“This is not a police state that you will pick up anyone without evidence. When you are bound by the law, then how you could take away a lawyer from the high court’s premises,” Justice Shakeel remarked.
Justice Wiqar observed that the Supreme Court had ordered authorities not to arrest anyone from the court’s premises.

Begins contempt proceedings against police over Aftab Alam’s detention

He wondered whether these were policemen or kidnappers that they showed up on the court’s premises to pick up people whose cases were scheduled for hearing.
Advocate Aftab Alam, who is also the PTI’s candidate from PK-90 Kohat, was taken away from the premises of the high court on Thursday by police officials in plainclothes as well as in uniform.
The detainee went there in connection with different cases, including those on election matters.
Senior counsel Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah had filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of a cousin of the detainee, Eid Rehman, against his detention.
The matter was initially taken up for hearing by Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, who referred it to a bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali.
The bench ordered the police to produce the detainee on Friday.
Advocate Syed Sikandar Hayat argued that the detainee had already been granted protective bails in eight cases, some of which were related to the holding of a PTI workers convention in Kohat last month.
He argued that in an earlier petition of the detainee, the government had conceded that only the said eight cases were pending against him and he was not required in any other case.
The lawyer also produced copies of the orders of different courts, including the high court’s for the grant of transit bails to the detainee.
PHC Bar Association General Secretary Lajbar Khan Khalil and former president of the association, Fida Gul, also turned up in the case and contended that arresting a person from the premises of the high court clearly showed the local police had been undermining the sanctity of this court.
Additional advocate general Danyal Asad Chamkani contended that the detainee had not been appearing before the relevant court and didn’t join investigation into those cases against him.
Officials of Peshawar police said they didn’t arrest the PTI lawyer and instead, he was taken away by Kohat police.
The bench observed whether the detainee was taken away by genies as both Peshawar and Kohat police denied arresting him.
During the hearing, Justice Wiqar Ahmad observed that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary and inspector general of police had declared in front of a bench headed by the chief justice that the court’s orders won’t be violated.
The bench observed that the PTI lawyer had been kept in illegal detention for a day.
It later decided to convert the habeas corpus petition into a contempt one declaring the matter serious.

6,PHC grants protective bail to PA speaker till Jan 22,PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Friday granted protective bail to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly speaker Mushtaq Ahmad...,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Friday granted protective bail to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani till Jan 22 and directed police and other law enforcement agencies not to arrest him in any of the cases against him.
A bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Wiqar Ahmad disposed of a petition filed by Mushtaq Ghani, presently in UK, seeking renewal of his passport and protective bail in cases against him.
The bench directed the respondents including police, Federal Investigation Agency, National Accountability Bureau, anti-corruption establishment, etc not to take any adverse action against him.
On the order of the high court, government had already renewed his passport, which was delivered to him in London.
Advocate Ali Azim Afridi appeared for the petitioner and stated that his client was a leader of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, a law abiding citizen and speaker of the provincial assembly.
He stated that he had gone abroad and in the meantime he came to know that he had been charged in a case registered regarding May 9 protests in Abbottabad.
He stated that he was nominated in the said case in Nov with mala fide intentions by the police.
He argued that as per their information the petitioner had not been charged in any other case.
Mr Afridi argued that the petitioner was also a candidate in the forthcoming general elections and he intended to return back to the country. However, he stated that the petitioner apprehended that he would be arrested on his return.
Additional advocate general Danyal Asad Chamkani appeared for the government and stated that earlier the petitioner was granted bail till Dec 27, but he didn’t appeared before the concerned court.
Mr Afridi stated that the petitioner intended to return back but when he had applied for renewal of passport, he came to know that his name was placed in the provisional national identity list (PNIL).
He added that after the court issued an order last month to the federal government, his passport was renewed.
He argued that the right to remain in, enter and move freely throughout Pakistan and to reside and settle in any part thereof, was a fundamentally guaranteed right, subjected to reasonable restrictions imposed by the law.
MURAD SAEED CASE: The bench recuses itself from hearing plea of PTI leader and former federal minister Murad Saeed and referred it to the chief justice for placing the same before another bench.
The bench observed that as both the members had also served as presiding officers of election appellate tribunals, therefore, it won’t be appropriate for them to hear this matter.
The nomination papers of Murad Saeed, who is presently in hiding, were rejected by the concerned returning officer for NA-4 Swat.
An election appellate tribunal in Swat had also rejected his appeal and had uphold his disqualification on the ground that he had been absconding.
He has now challenged both the orders of the returning officer and the tribunal before the high court requesting to set aside the said orders and declare him qualified for the polls.
His counsel Mohammad Inam Yousafzai stated that nomination papers of a candidate could not be rejected on the ground of his absconding from law as that ground had not been mentioned in Article 62 and 63 of the Constitution of Pakistan.

During visits to different localities in NA-19 constituency, this correspondent questioned voters about the role and contribution of various leaders of political and religious parties. Voters said that leaders made pledges and knocked at their doors during election campaign but it was difficult to even meet them once they were elected.
“I will not vote for anyone. The past experiences showed that our leaders deceived people and never ever worked for either people or country,” said Rahim Dad, 75, a resident of Naro Kallay.
Those people, who got various benefits from the government during the PTI regime, were still holding on to the hope and supported the same leaders once again but youth were divided. 
Rehmat Ali of Maneri Bala region said that it was claimed by Asad Qaiser, who remained speaker of national and provincial assemblies, that natural gas would be provided to consumers, however, people were misled for nearly a decade.
“We have played our due role by sending politicians of different parties to assemblies in various general elections and attached great expectations with them but what role they played,” questioned Rohal Amin of Topi.
Voters said that outage of gas and electricity, unemployment, lack of health and education facilities, broken link roads, corruption and brain drain were main issues about which politicians had pledged to resolve but they failed to fulfil their promises.
Voters in the constituency are visibly divided. Most of them are not interested even in taking part the elections. They question the contribution of various leaders and allege that they know the tactics to mislead people during election campaign.

The seat is considered important because of the hometown of PML-N provincial chief. Mr Muqam was supposed to contest from PK-30, but he has picked his brother, Ibadullah Khan, for the provincial assembly seat, while he himself decided to contest the NA seat.
In the last two elections, Mr Ibadullah won the seat. However, this time around, the PML-N provincial chief has decided to contest the NA seat himself. He kept winning the seat from 2002 to 2013.
Sources in PML-N told Dawn that the party’s local leadership had expressed concern about Mr Ibadullah’s poor performance in the NA constituency, and urged Muqam to contest it himself. 
Mr Muqam confirmed his decision to Dawn that he would be the candidate for NA-11, and his brother, Ibadullah would be contesting from PK-30, and former MPA Mohammad Rashad Khan from PK-28.
Mr Muqam said there would be no candidate of PML-N in PK-29 constituency, where the party would be supporting JUI-F’s Shaukat Ali.
Meanwhile, former PML-N MPA Fazlullah Khan said his father, Pir Mohammad Khan, was the mentor of Mr Muqam as he had brought him to politics, but the PML-N provincial chief had ditched them, forcing him to contest the elections as an independent candidate. 
He said they would defeat Mr Muqam in all the constituencies, including NA-11 where his uncle, Raja Pervaiz Khan, was contesting the elections. He said he PK-29 and his other uncle, Mohammad Ali Khan, from PK-30.
Families of Fazlullah Khan and Amir Muqam are relatives, but they have now developed serious differences prior to elections.
The NA-11 seat won’t be easy to win for PML-N Khyber Pakhtunkhwa president as his rival, Haji Said Fareen, is likely to contest the elections from the seat on PTI ticket for the first time after leaving ANP in 2021.
Also, ANP candidate from Mr Muqam’s hometown, Aurangzeb Khan, is also in the fray, threatening the prospects of Mr Muqam. Besides, Haji Ghafar Khan is contesting NA-11 on Jamaat-i-Islami ticket.

“The PML-N, PPP and PTI as well as the military generals who ruled the country in the last 76 year are responsible for all our problems. They destroyed the economy, introduced dynastic politics, and bad governance,” Mr Siraj told a public meeting in Haripur.
He complained about people’s poor access to healthcare, high inflation and massive joblessness in the country as well as financial crisis in PIA and Pakistan Railways and blamed them on the past governments of the three mainstream political parties and military dictators.
The JI chief said the return of the PML-N, PTI or PPP to power meant the country’s “destruction” as their top leaders were interested in the prosperous future of their children and not people’s.
“They [former ruling parties] are urging the people yet again to vote them to power because they want their wealth to increase,” he said.
Mr Siraj also alleged that former rulers gave away the occupied Kashmir to India, handed over Pakistani citizen Dr Aafia Siddiqui to the United States, freed Central Intelligence Agency contractor Raymond Davis, who killed Pakistanis, and didn’t protest the genocide of Palestinians, fearing America’s backlash.
He claimed that the PTI, PML-N as well as PPP formally offered JI seat adjustment for the Feb 8 elections but he declined the offer and decided that the party would contest polls on its own.
“We [Jamaat] have our own ideology, have no desire for wealth or power, and are striving for the introduction of Islamic system of governance in the country,” he said.
He said after coming to power, his party would do away with “VIP culture”, reform police and bureaucracy, and introduce an interest-free economy.
Mr Siraj criticised the district administration for denying the party an open space to hold the public meeting and said workers should besiege the offices of the local bureaucracyif the act was repeated.
The JI also addressed an election rally in Swabi in the day and said an honest leadership was required to strengthen the economy and address other national issues.
He said the former rulers, instead of ensuring good governance in the country, focused their attention on serving personal interest instead of working for the people’s development and therefore, all national institutions suffered.
Mr Siraj said only honest and committed leadership could ensure the country’s prosperity.
He said the country was caught in a debt trap and suffered from the worst economic situation in its history due to the wrong policies of the successive governments.
The JI chief also complained that 1.8 million cases were pending with the courts and the backlog was increasing fast.
He called for the speedy disposal of cases to the relief of the people.
Mr Siraj said the PPP, PTI and PML-N’s top leaders were “involved” in corruption, so the people shouldn’t vote for those parties.

Khushal Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Dashboard was launched at an event held at the Chief Minister’s House.
Provincial ministers Syed Masood Shah, Barrister Feroz Jamal Shah Kakakhel, Ahmed Rasool Bangash, Eng Ahmed Jan, Dr Najeebullah, principal secretary to CM Amjad Ali Khan, administrative secretaries and other senior officials were present, according to a statement.
It said alongside live monitoring of public service delivery centres across the province, the performance of provincial departments, district administrations and police department will be assessed through dashboard daily.
Moreover, 27 key performance indicators (KPIs), including blocked khewats, demarcation cases, pending mutation cases, revenue collection and retrieval of state land have been identified for district administrations, while nine KPIs, including actions against drug peddlers, street criminals, murderers and thieves, have been identified for police.
Furthermore, in the first phase, KPIs have also been identified for different departments, including health, home and tribal affairs, excise and narcotics control, local government, energy and power, livestock and dairy development, mines and minerals, relief and rehabilitation and public health engineering.
Speaking on this occasion, Justice Arshad Hussain lauded the efforts of cabinet members, chief secretary and his entire team for materialising this flagship project in an effective and timely manner.
He said eliminating corruption, maintaining law and order, ensuring good governance, improving public service delivery, devising human resource export strategy, addressing public complaints and acting against drug traffickers and encroachments were amongst the important components of the Khushal Khyber Pakhtunkhwa programme. He added the initiative also aimed at monitoring patwar khanas (revenue circles), police stations and other public service outlets.
The chief minister said due to insufficient job opportunities within the country, the provincial government had devised its human capital export strategy, under which youth would be imparted crash courses in different fields and sent abroad for employment.
He said the provincial government was committed to holding elections in a peaceful manner. 
Justice Arshad Hussain said keeping in view the current financial position of the province, the funding issue of merged districts, especially their share in NFC Award, had been taken up with the caretaker prime minister, who had constituted a committee headed by the secretary finance division to resolve the longstanding issue.

13,Marwat Qaumi Ittehad names poll candidates in Lakki Marwat,Salim Saifullah says grouping aims to end people’s economic hardships,"LAKKI MARWAT: Marwat Qaumi Ittehad (MQI), an electoral alliance formed by Saifullah brothers two years ago, has announced the names of candidates for the sole national and three provincial assembly constituencies in Lakki Marwat district.
The alliance’s president and former federal minister Salim Saifullah Khan announced the poll contenders at a press conference in Ghaznikhel on Friday.
He was flanked by former senator Osman Saiufullah Khan, PPP district president and former district nazim Iqbal Hussain Advocate, Ghaznikhel tehsil council chairman Zeeshan Mohammad Khan and JUI-Nazryati district chief Mufti Mohammad Khan Haqqani.
The former minister said that he would contest Feb 8 elections from NA-41.

Salim Saifullah says grouping aims to end people’s economic hardships

He said the aspirants for provincial assembly seats included Malik Najibullah Khan from PK-105, Dr Hisham Inamullah Khan from PK-106 and Anwar Saifullah Khan from PK-107.
Salim Saifullah said the alliance was formed keeping in view the backwardness of the area and deprivations of local people.
“In 2021, MQI swept local body elections as its candidates grabbed three top slots of tehsil chairmen,” he maintained, adding the triumphant history would be repeated in the coming elections.
He said MQI wanted to eliminate lawlessness, control unemployment and bring people out of economic hardship.
Criticising his political rivals, including JUI-F chief Maulana Fazalur Rehman, he said the Maulana wanted to see all his family members in the assemblies. He opposed the candidature of a son of the Maulana from Lakki NA seat, and asked him to contest elections from DI Khan, his home district.
He questioned the performance of JUI-F candidates and said their sole objective was to reach the power corridors to get contracts and kickbacks instead of uplifting the backward district.
He said the candidates affiliated with MQI would implement their uplift agenda if voted to power.
CRIMINALS ARRESTED: The police arrested two street criminals and seized mobile phones from them during a raid in Bannu on Friday.
Sub-divisional police officer Imran Aslam told reporters that taking notice of mobile phone snatching incidents, district police officer Iftekhar Shah tasked him to arrest the culprits.
“After tracing the two suspects a party of the city police raided a hideout and arrested both of them,” he said, identifying them as Saqib, a resident of Muslimabad Sukari, and Nabi Hasan of Ismailkhel. He said the cops recovered four snatched mobile phones from them.
Mr Imran said the arrested suspects had also shot at and injured a passerby during a mobile phone snatching attempt. He said the suspects used tosend their children into houses, and on knowing that no male member was present, they would enter the houses to loot mobile phones and other valuables from inmates at gunpoint.
