0,"Bilawal wins over PAT, demands probe into Model Town killings","It is believed that PAT has a considerable vote-bank in the constituency as its founder, Dr Tahirul Qadri, had claimed the seat back in 2002.","LAHORE: The Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) has assured Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari of its full support in the National Assembly’s constituency NA-127 (Lahore-XI) from where the PPP chairman is contesting the Feb 8 election.  The assurance came during a visit of Mr Bhutto-Zardari to the PAT secretariat here on Friday.
Talks between the two parties were already going on for the last some weeks to seek PAT support and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and PPP general secretary Nayyer Hussain Bukhari held a detailed discussion on the issue a few days ago.
 






PAT general secretary Khurram Nawaz Gandapur assured the PPP chairman that the support promise would not be hollow rather it would be visible to all as the party would also hold an election meeting in the latter’s favour in the constituency.
It is believed that PAT has a considerable vote-bank in the constituency as its founder, Dr Tahirul Qadri, had claimed the seat back in 2002.
 
 

Earlier, Mr Bhutto-Zardari was received by senior PAT leadership, including Mr Gandapur, Raja Zahid and Nurullah Siddiqui. He laid a floral wreath at the monument of the PAT workers who had been shot dead in a police raid on the party’s secretariat in Model Town back in June 2014.
He said that whoever was responsible for the 2014 tragedy should be punished. He also filled up a form for life membership of Tehreek Minhaj-ul-Quran, the parent body of PAT, and recalled that his mother too was a life member of Minhaj-ul-Quran and that he was restoring these contacts by following in her footsteps.

1,"JUI-F raised voice against refugees’ mistreatment, Fazl tells Afghan govt",Emphasises legal and structured Pak-Afghan trade; minor clash at Islamabad airport between alleged supporters of PTI and JUI-F.,"ISLAMABAD: Acknowledging mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Friday told Afghan authorities that he raised his voice on this issue.
On the last day of his visit to the neighbouring country, Maulana Rehman met with the de­­puty prime minister, Interior Minister Siraj­uddin Haqqani, and other cabinet members.
The JUI-F statement at the conclusion of his six-day visit to Afghanistan mentioned that the party chief met several cabinet members and high-ranking officials, assuring the Islamic Emirate of all possible cooperation.
 






Meanwhile, the senior party leaders acknowledged that the JUI-F chief had a meeting with the head of the Afghan government Mulla Hibatullah and discussed measures to eradicate the ‘thorns’ in the relations between the two countries.
On the other hand, several party leaders denied social media reports suggesting that the JUI-F chief also met with senior militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.

Emphasises legal and structured Pak-Afghan trade

The JUI-F statement mentioned that Maulana had a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister of Afghanistan, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, flanked by Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob, Minister of Foreign Affairs Mullah Amir Muttaqi,  and others.
Mullah Baradar highlighted that the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” was a safe and peaceful country, and said that they were suffering from negative propaganda.
Mullah Yaqub termed Maulana Rehman’s visit a timely move that will help reduce tension between the two countries, expressing confidence that the situation would change soon.
The commerce minister of Afghanistan emphasised higher trade volumes between Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, Mr Rehman stressed that trade between the two countries must be legal and structured.
In another meeting, Mr Haqqani briefed Maulana Rehman about the internal situation in Afghanistan, expressing a desire for cordial relations with Pakistan.
Minister for Refugees Haji Khalilur Rehman, present in the meeting, expressed concerns over the expulsion of (illegal) Afghan refugees from Pakistan, stating that the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan should end.
He emphasised that the government of Pakistan should have given time for Afghan refugees for voluntary return.
The JUI-F chief stated that his party had raised its voice over the mistreatment of Afghan refugees by Pakistan.
The JUI-F acknowledged that the party chief’s visit to Afghanistan has nothing to do with the government or any authority in Pakistan.
Airport hooliganism
Meanwhile, a minor clash occurred outside the arrival lounge of Islamabad International Airport between individuals, allegedly supporters of the PTI and supporters of JUI-F.
While Maulana Rehman was being welcomed by party workers after arriving from the arrival lounge, some individuals on the upper floor raised slogans against JUI-F and in support of PTI leadership.
Unaware that party workers were also present recording footage, a quarrel ensued, resulting in one individual being trapped among the clerics, who severely thrashed him, while the others accompanying him escaped the scene.

Fauzia Janjua

 
WASHINGTON: Fauzia Janjua, a Pakistani-American, has made history by becoming the first Muslim and South Asian woman to serve as the mayor of Mount Laurel in New Jersey. 
At her swearing-in ceremony at the Township Hall last week, Ms Janjua, accompanied by her family, proudly held a copy of the Holy Quran, emphasising the cultural diversity of her heritage. 
Assemblywoman Carol Murphy, a New Jersey state representative, administered the oath of office to Ms Janjua, who expressed deep pride in her Pakistani roots. 
“I am honoured to be the first Pakistani and Muslim woman mayor in the history of Mount Laurel. It’s a matter of pride for myself and the entire Pakistani community,” she told reporters after the ceremony.
Born in the US after her father’s migration in the 1970s, Ms Janjua highlighted her commitment to community service. Her dedication to improving lives led her to establish an NGO. 
“My commitment to community service has been a lifelong passion, focusing on teaching prisoners and underprivileged children,” she said.

Janjua is first South Asian woman to have been selected mayor of a US township; has served community, focusing on teaching prisoners, underprivileged children 

Ms Janjua said she established her NGO with an aim to improve people’s lives. 
“Reflecting on my political journey, it all began at a state governor’s party where a woman recognised my potential for leadership,” she added. “With that encouragement, I embarked on this path, ultimately achieving the historic position of mayor.” 
Beyond her political responsibilities, Ms Janjua has actively worked to showcase positive aspects of Muslim culture to the world. Leveraging her role as Deputy Mayor, she has promoted understanding and appreciation, contributing to the diverse tapestry of Mount Laurel’s community.

“We have celebrated cultural events like Juneteenth and the holiday tradition of the Menorah and Eid, showcasing the rich tapestry of our community’s heritage,” she said.
Mayor Janjua expressed anticipation of future achievements and praised the municipality’s diversity since she first assumed a council seat in 2021. 
Nikitas Moustakas, selected as the municipality’s Deputy Mayor, also highlighted the positive efforts of the community, including streamlined communications, investments for the whole community, park and recreation improvements, and support for small businesses.  
Both Ms Janjua and Mr Moustakas received standing ovations and vocal support from the standing-room-only crowd at the meeting. 
Assemblywoman Carol Murphy, who administered their oaths, said that the selection of Ms Janjua and Mr Moustakas fulfilled a commitment to make Mount Laurel Township more diverse, stronger, and community-friendly.  
Councilman Stephen Steglik, Mount Laurel’s immediate past mayor, encouraged Ms Janjua and Mr Moustakas, expressing confidence in the community’s support during both ups and downs. 
As Ms Janjua takes on the role of mayor, her journey reflects not only personal achievement but also a commitment to fostering inclusivity and diversity in Mount Laurel. 
The New Jersey media, while commenting on her success, pointed out that her story serves as an inspiration, highlighting the power of an individual to make a positive impact on the communities. 
Ms Janjua’s historic role opens doors for further representation and highlights the importance of embracing and celebrating the diverse backgrounds that con-tribute to the vibrant fabric of Mount Laurel.

3,Resolution for  three-month election delay  lands in Senate,ECP and SC urged to postpone polls in view of security challenges,"ISLAMABAD: A day after lawmakers belonging to the PTI, PPP and JI requisitioned the Senate session to discuss timely conduct of general elections scheduled for Feb 8, another resolution seeking to delay polls for three months in view of the fragile security situation landed in the Senate Secretariat on Friday. 
“The Upper House of the Parliament in the context of the culmination of phases in respect of the constitutional responsibility of holding elections expresses deep concern over the rising incidents of targeting electoral candidates,” a resolution submitted with the Senate Secretariat by ‘independent’ lawmaker Senator Hidayat Ullah reads.
The resolution referred to the surge in acts of terrorism and violence in the country with particular reference to armed attacks in North Waziristan, Bajaur and Turbat, causing severe injuries to a veteran nationalist politician running for national and provincial assembly seats, and killing of another candidate.
The resolution said that these incidents had perturbed the country and created an environment of insecurity.

ECP and SC urged to postpone polls in view of security challenges

It added that threatening pamphelets sent to residences and campaign offices of the electoral candidates had added to the security challenges.
It said the Upper House of Parliament recognises that holding general elections was a constitutional responsibility, but stressed that it equally lays emphasis on free and fair conduct of polls and security of all stakeholders and hindrance-free participation in the electoral process, and guarantees protection of lives and property of the people being a fundamental right.
The resolution said that Article 9 of the Constitution highlights that it was a basic right, which has to be provided by the State.
The resolution urged the Election Commission of Pakistan and the Supreme Court to sympathetically consider conduct of peaceful elections and postpone the polls for three months in view of the security challenges.
During this time, the resolution said, the government should create an environment guaranteeing a level-playing field for all political parties and candidates.

5,BHC allows Raisani to contest election,The lawyers for Mengal and others say the PPP candidate was not registered as a voter in any constituency of the country.,"QUETTA: A two-member bench of the Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Friday rejected the Balochistan Appellate Tribunal’s decision to disqualify Nawabzada Jamal Khan Raisani, PPP’s candidate for National Assembly constituency NA-264, Quetta, and declared him eligible to contest the election.
Mr Raisani had filed his nomination papers for contesting polls on NA-264, Quetta, which were accepted by the returning officer, but Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the President of BNP-Mengal, and other candidates challenged the acceptance of his papers in the Appellate Tribunal.
The lawyers for Mr Mengal and others informed the tribunal that Mr Raisani was not registered as a voter in any constituency of the country and, therefore, he could not contest election from any constituency.
The tribunal judge, Justice Hashim Khan Kakar, after the hearing accepted the appeal and rejected the returning officer’s decision and disqualified Mr Raisani.
Mr Raisani challenged the tribunal’s decision in the BHC by filing a constitutional petition.
The two-member bench of BHC comprising Justice Ejaz Swati and Justice Rozi Khan heard the petition.
The lawyer for the petitioner pleaded that the name of his client has already been registered and the Election Act, 2017, allows him to contest election.
The bench, after the hearing, had reserved the judgement which was announced on Friday.
The high court bench rejected the decision of the tribunal and allowed Mr Raisani to contest election.
The same bench also dismissed the application filed against the acceptance of Mr Mengal’s nomination papers.

6,"Economy stable, but challenges persist: IMF","Acknowledges revenue performance, spending restraint.","WASHINGTON: The IMF Executive Board’s decision to disburse around $700 million to Pakistan reflects a positive review of the country’s economic reform programme. While economic activity has stabilised, challenges persist, contingent on the effective implementation of sound policies.
Macroeconomic conditions have shown improvement, with a projected two per cent growth in FY24. The fiscal position strengthened in 1QFY24, achieving a primary surplus of 0.4pc of GDP, driven by strong revenues. Inflation, although elevated, is expected to decline with appropriately tight monetary policy to 18.5pc by end-June 2024.
Gross reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased to $8.2 billion in December 2023, and the exchange rate remained stable.
 
 

IMF’s Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Sayeh emphasises the need for “continued strong ownership to maintain momentum in stabilising Pakistan’s economy.”

Acknowledges revenue performance, spending restraint

The authorities’ efforts in revenue performance and federal spending restraint are acknowledged, but challenges, including provincial spending pressures, require ongoing attention. She underlines “the importance of broad-based fiscal reforms to mobilise additional revenues and improve public financial management.”
 
 

Challenges identified in the IMF’s statement include high inflation impacting vulnerable groups. The SBP’s tight stance is deemed appropriate, adding that “a market-determined exchange rate is crucial for external shock absorption and rebuilding foreign exchange reserves.”
The statement also underlines addressing undercapitalised financial institutions and ensuring financial sector vigilance, pointing out that these are essential for sustained stability. Ms Sayeh underlines the imperative of job creation and inclusive growth in Pakistan, calling for “the protection of vulnerable groups through programmes like BISP.”
The IMF also stresses the need for structural reforms, improvement in the business environment, and expediting the process of restructuring and reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
In the context of Pakistan’s economic progress, the mention of SOE reform suggests a focus on restructuring and improving the efficiency of state-owned enterprises as part of broader economic reforms. This may require the government to privatise loss-making enterprises. The IMF also suggests governance enhancement and anti-corruption measures, and climate resilience, identified as key drivers for Pakistan’s economic progress.
The positive outlook for Pakistan’s dollar bonds, with investors anticipating another IMF bailout, is intricately tied to the overall narrative of economic progress. Investors find the bonds attractive, expecting gains despite a significant rise in 2023. This optimism is influenced by the commitment to IMF programs and potential reforms, such as adjusting fuel and electricity prices.
The success in meeting IMF demands has contributed to reducing the risk of default in 2024. However, the upcoming elections and the imperative of sustained adherence to the IMF programme are crucial factors influencing this positive outlook. This linkage underscores the interconnected nature of economic indicators, policy decisions, and investor sentiment in shaping Pakistan’s economic landscape.

7,Khokhar-Sharif show in Lahore as ‘N’ announces tickets,Party manages to solve Ayaz-Rohail tiff; IPP also issues list of final candidates.,"LAHORE: The Sharif and Khokhar families got the lion’s share of tickets on the coveted National Assembly seats in Lahore as PML-N finally announced its list of candidates for the general elections.
The announcement followed protracted deliberation as the party had a seat adjustment agreement with the  Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and had to accommodate its leaders.
The party also managed to solve the dispute between Sheikh Rohail Asghar and Sardar Ayaz Sadiq. Both were vying for a ticket from the NA-121 seat, claiming that their areas from previous constituencies were merged into it after new delimitation.
Mr Asghar prevailed in the contest, apparently due to the  “vote of party supremo Nawaz Sharif”. Mr Sadiq will now contest from the NA-120 seat.

Party manages to solve Ayaz-Rohail tiff; IPP also issues list of final candidates

With the announcement of candidates, the party has directed leaders who failed to get tickets to withdraw their nomination papers.
Ishaq Dar, the head of PML-N’s central election cell, said those leaders should now “extend all-out support to the party-nominated candidates”.
The Khokhar-Sharif show
Mr Nawaz will contest NA-130 and have to face the challenge from PTI’s Dr Yasmin Rashid, who is currently in prison.
Mr Nawaz’s younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif, has been nominated on two NA and one Punjab Assembly seat — NA-123 (Lahore),  NA-132 (Kasur) and PP-164 (Lahore).
Mr Shehbaz’s son, Hamza Shehbaz, has got tickets from NA-118 (old Lahore) and PP-147.
PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif has got the ticket from NA-119, the constituency of her choice. This has effectively pushed IPP’s Aleem Khan to NA-117.
Ms Sharif is also contesting on PP-159. She, however, has withdrawn her nomination papers from two Punjab Assembly seats on the leadership’s direction to accommodate some other party leaders.
The Khokhar family managed to bag tickets from four National and provincial assembly constituencies in Lahore.
Saiful Malook Khokhar, president of the party’s Lahore chapter and also “a blue-eyed leader” of Ms Sharif, will contest from NA-126. His brother, Afzal Khokhar, got the ticket from NA-125; his son, Faisal Khokhar, from PP-168; and his relative, Imran Shafi, from PP-167.
The Khokhar family has been bestowed with tickets despite severe resentment among the party ranks for favouring the wealthy Khokhars at the cost of loyal workers.
Even Mr Hamza had requested his uncle, Mr Nawaz, to accommodate loyal workers on different constituencies in Lahore and other parts of Punjab, but to no avail.
Other notable party loyalists who failed to make the cut are Shaista Pervaiz Malik, the wife of late PML-N Lahore president Pervaiz Malik, and her son Ali Pervaiz.
The party has reportedly told them that it had to accommodate the IPP and PTI deserters “under compulsion”.
For the remaining NA seats in Lahore, the ticket for NA-122 went to Khawaja Saad Rafique, NA-124 to Rana Mubashir Iqbal, NA-127 to Attaullah Tarar and NA-129 to Hafiz Nauman.
Out of 14 NA seats in Lahore, the party has announced candidates on 12, apparently leaving the two seats — NA-117 and NA-128 —  for IPP leaders Aleem Khan and Awn Chaudhry, respectively.
However, both PML-N and IPP are tight-lipped over their seat-adjustment arrangements.
In total, PML-N has left seven NA and 11 Punjab Assembly seats for top IPP leaders.
As both PML-N and IPP have yet to announce formal seat adjustment, sources believe that last-minute tinkering is being done to the plan.
IPP announces candidates
Separately, the IPP also issued a list of over 50 candidates for National and Punjab Assembly seats on Friday.
 






According to the list, IPP’s patron-in-chief, Jahangir Khan Tareen, will be the candidate from NA-155 and NA-149 in Lodhran and Multan, respectively.
On the Lodhran seat, PML-N has already awarded the ticket to Saddique Baloch.
IPP secretary general Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan is the candidate on NA-70 Sialkot after PML-N refused her the ticket and gave it to Armaghan Subhani.
The party’s president, Mr Aleem, has got tickets from NA-117 and PP-149 in Lahore. The ticket for NA-54 (Taxila-Rawalpindi) has been award­ed
to Ghulam Sarwar Khan. Both are a part of the seat adjustment agreement with PML-N.
IPP has declared the status of NA-48 Islamabad and NA-128 Lahore as “pending”. Former federal minister Amir Kiyani and Mr Chaudhry are interested in contesting the seats, respectively.
The ticket for NA-133 (Kasur) went to Hashim Dogar. However, the party didn’t field any candidate against Mr Shehbaz on the city’s NA-132 seat.
Nauman Langrial, Rana Nazir Khan and Hamayun Akhtar Khan have been awarded tickets from NA-143 (Sahiwal), NA-79 (Gujranwala) and NA-97 (Faisalabad).
The PML-N has also left the field empty for Mr Langrial.

8,Army chief witnesses weapons firing at exercise,Terms  National Aerospace Science and Technology Park (NASTP) a project of national and strategic significance.,"KARACHI: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir was in Karachi on Friday where he witnessed firing of different Air Defence weapons systems during Exercise Al-Bayza-III, 2024 at Sonmiani.
The army chief viewed integrated fire and battle manoeuvres of Army Air Defence systems, which include High to Medium Air Defence Weapons system (HIMADS), Low to Medium Air Defence system (LOMAD), Short Ra­­nge Air Defence system (SHORADs) and Exten­­ded Short Range Air Defence system (ESHORADs).
Gen Munir appreciated the achievement of engaging targets with precision and operational readiness of Corps of Army Air Defence.
While interacting with officers and troops, the COAS highlighted that armed forces of the country are modernising their systems in line with the requirements to deter and be able to respond to any threat emanating against Pakistan.
He termed the National Aerospace Science and Technology Park (NASTP) a project of national and strategic significance that would yield manifold benefits for the country since it would spur technological progress and foster self-reliance by offering a platform for the nation’s youth and future generations.
 






Earlier, the army chief visited Army Air Defence Centre, laid a floral wre­ath at Yadgar-i-Shuhada and paid homage to martyrs of armed forces.

9,Resignation brings Justice Ijaz’s role in skyscraper to fore,One Constitution Avenue embroiled in Rs17bn default scandal; CDA tells IHC flat allottees can’t seek court’s intervention to settle dispute.,"• One Constitution Avenue embroiled in Rs17bn default scandal
• CDA tells IHC flat allottees can’t seek court’s intervention to settle dispute with owner
ISLAMABAD: The case of the capital’s renowned skyscraper, One Constitution Avenue, has become a little more complex after the Capital Development Authority (CDA) informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that flat allottees in the high-rise could not seek the court’s intervention in their dispute with the building’s owner.
The development is part of a broader case concerning the termination of the lease to BNP (Pvt) Ltd, the building’s developer, over a significant default of Rs17 billion. The IHC is scheduled to deliberate on this matter next week.
The controversy has gained additional attention due to the involvement of Supreme Court judge Ijazul Ahsan, who resigned earlier this week.
 
 

According to the court’s record, the builder’s petition is scheduled for a hearing on Jan 17 against the termination of his lease over default.
One Constitution Avenue, launched in 2005 following the auction of a 13.5-acre plot for Rs4.8bn, has been marred by controversies from the start.
The CDA handed over the plot’s possession to the company after receiving only Rs800 million the same year.
By 2016-17, only Rs1.02bn of the remaining amount was paid to the civic agency.
In 2016, the CDA cancelled the lease of the plot. IHC Justice Athar Minallah not only upheld the CDA’s decision but also asked the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to launch an investigation into the matter.
However, the project was de-sealed in 2021 following a judgement headed by the then chief justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar.
In line with the 2019 verdict, the developer was supposed to deposit Rs17.5bn in installments over eight years. The company deposited the first instalment of Rs1.7bn and later reneged on its commitment.
However, the CDA shif­ted the increase in the cost of land to the allottees of the flats, who challenged this before the IHC.
The CDA has recently submitted a reply in this matter, saying that the allottees could not invoke the jurisdiction as they didn’t have the right or ability to bring legal action to a court of law.
Meanwhile, the owner also filed a petition before the IHC in August last year and obtained a stay order.
Role of Justice Ijaz
Former Supreme Court judge Ijazul Ahsan has been repeatedly mentioned in this case. He was facing a couple of references in connection with this skyscraper and was also part of the bench that restored the lease.
Last year, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, PML-N’s chief organiser, publicly accused him of corruption in connection with the One Constitution Avenue project, bringing the case into the limelight.
Before his appointment as a Lahore High Court judge, Mr Ahsan was a legal adviser to BNP. Documents seen by Dawn revealed that Mr Ahsan, on July 26, 2005, wrote to the Bank of Punjab regarding a bank guarantee for the project.
He also issued a legal notice to Belhasa International Company on Sept 22, 2005, on behalf of BNP, in connection with the same project.
In May 2017, the Fed­e­r­­al Investigation Agency registered an FIR against the owners, form­­er chairman CDA Kamran Lashari, member planning retired Brig Nusrat, former member finance Kamran Qureshi, former member administration Shaukat Mohammad and former member engineering Moin Kakakhel.
Then-additional legal adviser Rai Nawaz Kharal, former director of estate Habibur Rehman Gillani and former project management director Dr Faisal Awan were also nominated.
The FIR alleged that the builders constructed luxury apartments instead of a lu­­­xury hotel and sold apartments to vario­­us buyers illegally, thereby extracting bil­­lions of rupees from the public through fraud.
Mr Kharal filed a petition before the IHC seeking pre-arrest bail, and during the course of arguments, he stated that he alleged before the court that the FIA nominated him in FIR as accused to implicate the apex court judge in the case. Talking to Dawn, Mr Kharal reiterated the same stance.
At that time, Ijazul Ahsan was part of the five-member bench that was hearing the case related to the Panama Papers.
The bench later disqualified former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and on its direction, NAB filed three references against the Sharif family.
The judge was also appointed as a mon­­itoring judge of the accountability court.
The court convicted Mr Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and son-in-law Safdar Awan in an expeditious trial days before the 2018 general elections.
