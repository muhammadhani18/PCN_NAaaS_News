0,Lowest bid for bus depot turns out to be 93pc more than estimated cost,"Official raises questions about calculation of project cost, bidding process","ISLAMABAD: The civic agency opened tenders for the construction of a bus depot at Zero Point for the Metro Bus Service and, surprisingly, received a lowest bid that is around 93pc higher than the estimated cost of the project. 
The estimated cost of the project is Rs1.1 billion but the CDA received the ‘lowest’ bid of Rs1.95 billion, which is 93pc higher than the estimated cost. This has raised serious questions over the estimates calculated either by the CDA, its consultant or the bidding process.
The civic agency wants to construct the depot along Srinagar Highway in Zero Point for metro buses which will be operated on 13 routes. The CDA through its contractor will get 160 buses soon for the new routes. 
The electric buses have been manufactured in China and a fleet of first 30 buses after installation of intelligence transport system is ready for departure for Pakistan and will reach Islamabad within one month followed by two more fleets in next two months. 

Official raises questions about calculation of project cost, bidding process

Sources said the CDA will start operation of the 30 buses as soon as they arrived as it has the charging facility and a vast parking lot at Convention Centre.
Meanwhile, the civic agency had called tenders for construction of depots one each in Zero Point, Tramri and in I-9. The first tender was opened on January 8 that related to the Zero Point depot, while the tenders for the two other depots will be opened in coming days. Work on the Zero Point Depot, when started, will be completed in six months.
“There is something fishy, there could be question marks either on Notice Inviting Tender (NIT), cost of the project calculated by CDA and its consultant or on the bidding process. Almost 93pc higher rates make all this interesting,” said an official of CDA.
Sources said to get contract of the project worth Rs 1.01 billion, three companies had submitted bids and one of them, Qalandar Bux Abro & Company, turned to be the lowest bidder by submitting a bid of Rs1.95billion, which is 93pc higher than the estimated cost. The rates of two other companies were very close to the lowest bidder. One of them had submitted a bid of Rs 1.99b which was around 96pc above and the other’s bid was Rs2.02b, which was 99.99 pc above the estimated cost.
Sources said four other construction companies had requested CDA’s department concerned for an extension in the deadline for submission of documents, but the department rejected their request. 
According to documents available with Dawn, the CDA on Wednesday shared the details of bids with the consultant – Engineering Consultancy Service Punjab - for evaluation of lowest bid/quoted rate with respect to reasonability of rates and workability.
Speaking to Dawn, an officer of CDA said nothing was finalised yet. 
“Yes, we received lowest bid which is 93pc higher than the estimate. But we have shared the details of all bids with our consultant for evaluation. We will move in accordance with rules and regulations,” the officer said.
Another officer said to avoid any controversy and for speedy completion of the depot, the CDA had opted for only government-owned construction companies and had called tenders from companies like FWO and NLC, but none of the government-owned entities showed interest in the project. 
He said the CDA then went for a new tender to hire someone from the private sector.
It is relevant to note here that 160 buses would be operated on 13 routes by the National Radio and Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC) - the contractor of the CDA which had placed orders for manufacturing the buses with an international firm that is manufacturing them in China.
As per the agreement, the CDA will pay the NRTC about Rs306 to Rs331 per kilometre to operate the buses. 
The 13 routes include Police Foundation/Orange Line Station to Red Line Faiz Ahmed Faiz Station in I-8, Allama Iqbal Station to Red Line Potohar Station, Pims to Secretariat, D-12 to G-10; F-11 to Red Line F-8 Station, G-11 to Pims, Aabpara to Tramri 
Chowk, Nilor to Khanna Pul, Pirwadhai Chowk to Faizabad, B-17 to Chungi No 26 and I-16 to Chungi No 26. 
CDA spokesperson Nauman Khalild could not be approached for comments.

1,Dispirited Rashid not to contest from NA-57 as PTI announces candidates,"RAWALPINDI: After the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) announced candidates for various constituencies in Rawalpindi,...","RAWALPINDI: After the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) announced candidates for various constituencies in Rawalpindi, including the ones on which its former ally, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, is contesting, the disappointed former interior minister withdrew his nomination papers from one of the two constituencies that he had been vying for.
Mr Ahmed had submitted papers for NA-56 and NA-57 constituencies, but withdrew from NA-57 whereas his nephew, Sheikh Rashid Shafique, withdrew his papers from NA-56 and would be contesting from NA-57. Both uncle and nephew will contest from the platform of Awami Muslim League (AML).
Though Sheikh Rashid Ahmed tried to get the support of the PTI, the party decided to field its own candidate who will face PML-N’s Hanif Abbasi, PPP’s Sumaira Gul and Sheikh Rashid Ahmed. He had distanced himself from the PTI when he surfaced after remaining missing for 34 days.
Following the announcement of general elections, he tried to convince PTI to support him and not field any candidate against him. A few days ago, PTI leader Latif Khosa was seen supporting Sheikh Rashid Ahmed in a video that was circulating on social media. He was seen speaking in favour of Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on his insistence, but it did not work, and PTI announced its own candidates from the two constituencies of the garrison city.
The PTI awarded party tickets for NA-55 cantonment areas to Raja Basharat, has fielded Shahryar Riaz from NA-56 and Seemabia Tahir from NA-57 constituency. On the other hand, the PML-N’s candidate for NA-55is Malik Abrar Ahmed, NA-56, Hanif Abbasi; and NA-57 Daniyal Chaudhry.
The PPP has fielded Babar Sultan Jadoon from NA-55, Sumaira Gul from NA-56 and Mukhtar Abbas from NA-57.
It is likely to be a tough election for the eight-time winner who has remained in the National Assembly from 1985 to 2018.
When contacted, AML chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was unavailable for comments, however, his nephew, who is also a former MNA, Sheikh Rashid Shafique, told Dawn that Sheikh Rashid would contest the election from NA-56 while he contest from NA-57 constituency.
“We will contest the election on the AML election symbol ‘Pen and Inkpot’ and will go to people’s court with our work for the common man,” Mr Shafique said.
He said we had done a lot for the residents of the garrison city, and people know who had worked day and night for their welfare, adding that we did not give any interview against any party or its leaders and continued our work for the welfare of the people.

However, light rain (with light snowfall over mountains) is expected in Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan on January 13, 16 and 17.
Temperatures in twin cities of Rawalpindi usually drop to minus one or two degrees in December and January. On January 28, 1984, -3.5 degree Celsius was recorded in Islamabad and -4.3 degree was recorded on December 25, 1984. On January 26, 2008, the capital had also recorded -2.8 degrees Celsius.

Light rain (with light snowfall over the mountains) is expected in Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan on January 13, 16 and 17. Rain-fed arid areas will remain under water stress and the public is advised to use water judiciously.
Due to foggy conditions in plain areas, day temperatures are likely to remain from 4 to 6 degrees below normal. Farmers are advised to manage their crops and keep their livestock at warm places due to prevailing cold weather conditions.
Travelers are advised to remain extra cautious during the foggy days. It also stated that the citizens should ignore rumours on social media about snowfall in plains of Punjab. 
Since last week, citizens of the twin cities have been braving the severe weather amid low gas pressure and electricity outages.
The areas worst affected by low gas pressure are: Media Town, Nayyar Colony, Chaklala Scheme-III, Shah Khalid Colony, Dhoke Ratta, Chaklala, Jhanda Cheechi, Marir Hassan, Morgah, Adiala Road, Fazaia Colony, Sadiqabad, Shamsabad, Dhoke Kala Khan, Nayya Mohallah, Raja Bazaar, Purana Qila, Chittian Hatian, Mohallah Waris Khan, Allama Iqbal Colony, Dhoke Dalal, Akalgarh, Tahli Mohri, Tench Bhatta, Kiani Road, Azizabad and some adjoining localities.

3,MWM to donate waterproof tents to Baloch protesters,Sammi Deen Baloch said they too were concerned about the weather condition as a number of more families of missing persons had arrived at their camp.,"ISLAMABAD: Visitors continued to pour in at the two Baloch protest camps set up outside the National Press Club (NPC) – both demanding justice to counter lawlessness in the province.
One camp has been established by the Baloch Yekjehti Committee (BYC), which received around 200 warm shawls donated by the women wing of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM).
Expressing their sympathies with the protesters, the MWM women wing leaders promised to provide waterproof tents to the BYC camp ahead of rains in the coming days. 
The tents would be donated by families of missing persons belonging to their community.
Talking to Dawn, Sammi Deen Baloch said they too were concerned about the weather condition as a number of more families of missing persons had arrived at their camp.
“You can see ash and burnt wood as this is the way we try to stay warm after sunset. But, conditions will get difficult to bear once it rains,” Sammi Deen added.
Meanwhile, the participants of their rival camp set up by Balochistan Shuhada Forum (BSF) claimed that there was a picture of Sammi Deen Baloch with Dr Ala Nazar, leader of Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), “which proves that she was a member of BLA”.
Ms Deen, meanwhile, claimed that all such pictures were edited and doctored.
On the other hand, caretaker Balochistan Information Minister Jan Achakzai visited the BSF camp and while talking to media demanded exemplary punishment to the terrorists and miscreants who were restricting growth and progress in the province.
Mr Achakzai said they were at the press club not to counter the BYC camp but to press their own demands for justice to the family members of the deceased.
“We want the judiciary and the authorities to ensure that the terrorists are awarded exemplary punishments,” he said, adding that those killing the innocent were against growth and progress of the province. However, he soon added that the social media accounts of the BYC were being operated from India and said there were proof that the Indian agency RAW was funding it.
Later, talking to Dawn, the Balochistan caretaker information minister disclosed that most of the BYC members and even several politicians were deliberately distorting the issue and did not present themselves at the commission or at the relevant forum.
“They criticise the state, the army and even use abusive language against any person they feel like; they even equate the conditions in Kashmir with Balochistan, but the fact is that Kashmir is an unresolved disputed issue pending at the UN,” Mr Achakzai said.
The provincial minister said one serious problem in the justice system was that terrorists and law breakers could not be proven guilty in the court.
Meanwhile, as per the directives of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the capital’s civic body installed two more makeshift toilets at the protest area in front of the National Press Club.
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC last week barred Islamabad police from dispersing Baloch protesters camped outside the NPC on a petition filed by Sammi Deen Baloch.
The court also directed the deputy commissioner to ensure proper sanitation and hygiene at the protest camp by deputing staff.

According to sources, the situation at the airport got tense when 25 to 30 workers of JUI-F, gathered in front of the arrival lounge of the airport to receive their chief Maulana Fazalur Rehman, chanted slogans in favour of their chairman, which were responded by some visitors who came to see off passengers as they shouted slogans against Maulana Fazlur Rehman.

8,Hereditary politics dominates PPP’s selection of candidates for three NA seats from capital,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) on Friday awarded tickets for three National Assembly seats in Islamabad...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) on Friday awarded tickets for three National Assembly seats in Islamabad and apparently ‘promoting hereditary politics’ ignored those who were said to be more capable of winning.
According to a list, the candidates who received party tickets are: Raja Imran Ashraf, brother of National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf for NA-45 (Islamabad I); Sibtul Haider Bukhari, brother of PPP Secretary General Nayyar Hussain Bukhari for NA-47 (Islamabad-II) and Chaudhry Asad Pervaiz for NA-48 (Islamabad-III).
According to a PPP leader, 20 candidates had filed nomination papers in the three constituencies, hoping that the party would award them tickets. “Some of the ignored candidates were more capable to win,” he told Dawn on conditioning anonymity.
There are concerns over the nomination of Raja Imran Ashraf from Islamabad. Many workers even pointed out that Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, his brother and a son had already filed nominations from Gujar Khan; therefore, the entry of Raja Imran in the federal capital would discourage local PPP workers.
Sources in the PPP said there was severe resentment in the party ranks about fielding of “old faces and relatives of senior leaders” unlike other parties whose frontline leaders contested elections in Islamabad. 
They added that PPP Secretary General Nayyar Bukhari and Punjab President Raja Pervaiz Ashraf also played a key role in picking party candidates in the federal capital.
Interestingly, no interview was conducted which indicated that the decision about the candidates had been made somewhere else.
When contacted, a senior PPP leader said many voters were concerned about the selection of candidates in NA-46 and NA-47 and decided not to support Raja Imran Ashraf and Sibtul Haider.
There are also reports about disagreement between PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and his father Asif Ali Zardari on the award of tickets to candidates in the capital. 
According to sources, the PPP chief wanted some “new, young and non-controversial faces to contest elections from Islamabad, but Mr Zardari was backing already-tested candidates”.
In NA-46, four PPP workers, Raja Imran Ashraf, Adnan Shah, president of People’s Youth Organisation (PYO) Islamabad, Nighat Batool, senior vice president women wing Islamabad, and Samana Malaika Raza, human rights cell’s secretary general, had filed nominations.
Samana Malaika Raza is also on the PPP’s list of candidates for women’s reserved seats and also filed her nomination papers from NA-46. She hails from Jhangi Syedan and has a considerable standing among locals, including in Shah Allah Ditta and the urban sectors of Islamabad. Being daughter of the soil and a member of a respectful family, Samana could have an edge to get support from her Biradri (clan). She is an educated woman and has served in the United Nations.
In NA-48, which includes Rawat, Sihala, Ghori Town, Banigala, Alipur, Margalla Town and Sohan near Faizabad, there are five PPP nominations: Chaudhary Asad Pervaiz, Umar Awan, Aftab Shah, Zeeshan Naseeb and Khaqan Khawaja. Sources said Khaqan Khawaja could be more suitable candidate of the PPP from NA-48.

Police also claimed to have recovered police uniforms and looted items from the inter-provincial gangs.
Four of the robbers wanted in the murder of the expat during a robbery three days ago were allegedly killed when they opened fire on police in the Race Course area late Thursday night. Tasaraf Mehmood was shot dead on his return from the United Kingdom in the Race Course area by robbers wearing police uniforms two days ago.

He said police signaled four motorcycle riders to stop in the Race Course area. However, they started firing and the police retaliated and killed the four suspects.
The dead robbers were identified as Sajid alias Gutto, Hasan, Mohammad Ali alias Babio and Waseem. Weapons used in the incidents and police uniforms were recovered from the suspects. 
In the second incident, four suspects riding a motorcycle opened fire on police in Morgah police area. During the encounter, two of the suspects were killed. The spokesman said one of the suspects, Ahmed Khan, was involved in several incidents of street crime.

10,Court issues show cause notice to CDA chairman,ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has issued contempt of court notices to the Capital Development Authority...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has issued contempt of court notices to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman and other officials for flouting the court’s direction of allotment of plots to an allottee that has been running from pillar to post for over a decade.
The court’s order also exposed the disorder in the law wing of the civic agency as it reflected that the lawyer representing the CDA gave a conceding statement without the consent of the competent authority.
IHC Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri issued the contempt notices to the CDA chairman, retired Capt Anwarul Haq, Member Estate Tariq Salam and Director Estate Tabinda Tariq, “for willfully flouting, disobeying and disregarding the order dated October 10, 2023” regarding the allotment of a plot to a petitioner, Nizamuddin Siddiqui.
The petitioner purchased an industrial plot in I-10/3 from Ghulam Murtaza, son of Ghulam Ahmad, which was allotted to him by CDA through an open auction.
After completing all the codal formalities, the plot was transferred in the name of the petitioner on June 6, 2013 by CDA.
Subsequently, Mr Murtaza applied for the plot’s possession, and the surveyor deputed for handing over the physical possession of the subject plot reported that the plot existed on a graveyard. Besides, two graves were present on the plot, so it was not possible to hand over the possession of the plot to the petitioner.
Last year, the court directed the CDA to make an alternative allotment of land in the name of the petitioner, but the CDA did not comply with the directives.
However, CDA took the stance that the civic agency’s counsel, Hunain Haider Thaheem, had not been instructed or supposed to record the conceding statement and disassociated himself from the panel of lawyers.
Mr Thaheem, on the other hand, challenged his removal, saying that he recorded the statement in accordance with the written comments submitted in response to the petition.
Interestingly, other counsels of the CDA, including Khurram Mehmood Qureshi and Amir Latif Gill, appeared before Justice Jahangiri earlier this week and said that there were no graves on the plots and the land was clear.
“It is very shocking to observe that the plot was transferred in the name of the petitioner on June 6, 2013, but he has been roaming around the CDA’s office for more than ten years, but his grievance has not been redressed despite the statement of CDA Director Estate Management II and clear directions issued by the Court,” said the court’s order.
Later, the court issued the show cause notices to the above-mentioned CDA authorities and summoned them to appear in person on January 25.

11,"30,000 saplings to be planted in F-9 park","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has announced that it will plant 30,000 plants in Fatima Jinnah...","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has announced that it will plant 30,000 plants in Fatima Jinnah Park, F-9, during the upcoming tree plantation campaign starting on February 8.
The CDA also decided to involve the private sector to plant trees in this park and other places in Islamabad under corporate social responsibility (CSR).
“For upcoming tree plantation, we will plant 30,000 plants in F-9 Park only, those companies who want to join hands are welcome but they will have to provide plants having at least 10 feet height,” said a director of environment.
He said that the environment wing, under the direction of Director General Environment Qaiser Khattak, had directed all wings of environment directorates that private firms that want to donate trees under CSR should be asked to provide only those plants or species for which the environment of this region is conducive and friendly.
The sources said that contrary to past practice, CDA itself now provides details of required plants to private companies. On Thursday, at the direction of DG Environment, two letters were sent to two private firms, Park Enclave Housing Scheme and Sui Northern Gas Pipeline, with a list of required plants and trees.
The letter, which was addressed to Park View Society, stated that by keeping the tradition of protecting the green cover of Islamabad with the active engagement of citizens, government bodies, and large corporations, the environment directorate has again embarked on the plantation drive. 
“We appreciate the offers made [by Park View] for provision of plants for the above purpose. In order for this donation to be more useful for general public, the environment experts of CDA have chalked out a list of plants/species for which the environment of this region is conducive/friendly. Hence, it is requested only following plants be opted for donation during the current plantation drive,” read the letter, which asked for Chir Pine, Kachnar, Amaltas, Jacarande, Pilkhan, Sukhchayn, Silver Oak, Chinar, Sapium, and Arjan.
Meanwhile, in a letter sent to SNGPL, the CDA, while referring to the ongoing work on gas pipelines, stated that this work [laying pipelines], despite being in the public interest, has its own hazards for the environment. 
“Such effects of this work should be ameliorated by joint efforts of CDA and SNGPL” read the letter, which requested the said gas-providing company to provide 10,000 trees with at least ten feet of height. 
The CDA provided a list of 17 plants.
Auction fetches over Rs13bn
