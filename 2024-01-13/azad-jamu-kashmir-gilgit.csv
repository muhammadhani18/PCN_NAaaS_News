0,Drought exacerbates twin cities’ water woes,"Unprecedented absence of rain, snowfall witnessed in hilly areas last month","The past year was characterised by a plethora of challenges including a steep rise in inflation and a severe economic crunch but a prolonged drought compounded the matters for Rawalpindi, Islamabad and other surrounding regions.
The month of December, typically marked by intermittent downpours, witnessed an unprecedented absence of rain and snowfall in the three hilly tehsils of Murree, Kotli Sattian, and Kahuta.
Simultaneously, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Rawalpindi and Islamabad surged to alarming levels. Rawalpindi recorded an air pollution index of 261, raising concerns among residents. Islamabad's air pollution rating reached 195, while other areas such as Murree, Attock, Jhelum, and Chakwal also experienced elevated pollution levels.
In the absence of rain, the air pollution index in Rawalpindi is projected to exceed the hazardous 300 level.
The Meteorological Department indicated a bleak outlook, with no possibility of rain in the next ten days.
Moreover, the prolonged dry and cold winter led to various health issues, including colds, coughs, sore throats, eye irritation, lung pain, fever, and itching. The three allied hospitals of Rawalpindi, including the DHQ Hospital, Benazir Bhutto General Hospital, and Cantt Hospitals, witnessed a surge in patients, with 4,000 to 4,500 individuals seeking medical attention daily.

The majority of patients were elderly and children, resulting in crowded outpatient departments (OPDs) early in the morning.
The drought extended its impact to surrounding areas like Adiala, Chakri, Jorian, Rawat, Kahuta Road, and GT Road areas, enveloping them in smog. The lack of rain contributed to dirt coating tree leaves while blowing dust into homes and workplaces throughout the day.
Private clinics in the region experienced a significant increase in patients, leading doctors to raise their fees from Rs250 to 350. These doctors capitalised on the demand for increased medical care.
In response to the deteriorating air quality and health concerns, Dr Inayat, the deputy medical superintendent of Benazir Bhutto Hospital, advised residents to protect themselves by wearing masks and consuming hot beverages.
He emphasised the importance of protective gear while riding a motorbike and cautioned against using ice cream and cold water. Urging prompt medical attention for itchy and swollen eyes, Dr Inayat recommended using hot water for hand and mouth hygiene and advised against leaving the house after sundown without complete cover.
The ongoing drought further exacerbated problems, causing a rapid decline in underground water levels and reducing water levels in the dams.

5,‘Fly on the Wall’ opens at PNCA,"Group exhibit features works of national, int’l photographers","A group photography exhibition, featuring the works of both national and international photographers, who offer a profound exploration of their diverse perspectives and compelling narratives, was opened at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts on Friday.
The group show titled, ‘Fly on the Wall’ curated by Aasim Akhtar, features the works of Ali Mehdi Zaidi, Arif Mehmood, Ayesha Vellani, Aysha Bilal, Hamid Moinuddin, Lukas Werth, Malcom Hutcheson, Shehzad Noorani, Stephan Andrew, William Dalrymple and Zaheer Chaudry.

Read: https://tribune.com.pk/story/2452522/a-mirrors-tale-on-display-at-pnca
Under the theme of “Retelling the Story of Pakistani Photographers’ Journey,” Aasim Akhtar’s curation aims to provide a fresh perspective on the profound and often overlooked work of Pakistani photographers. The show emphasises the importance of revisiting their narratives, fostering connections among peers, and encouraging a collective reflection on their shared responsibility as witnesses to history.
This exhibition defies conventional expectations, rejecting hierarchy and showcasing a diverse array of works that coalesce to form a captivating narrative. Aasim Akhtar’s selection process focused on initiating a dialogue among the photographers, allowing them to communicate with each other through their images and share their unique visions with the public. As Aasim Akhtar aptly puts it, “I have eschewed hierarchy because, in photography, it does not exist. What does exist is a deep mutual respect. No photographer is greater than another, no genre nobler than the next.”
The exhibition showcases the convergence of diverse views, turning the photographers’ gaze on the world, scrutinising it fragment by fragment. Each photograph, regardless of style or subject, serves as a testament to the photographers' compulsive urge to bear witness to the human experience.
The show will remain on display for public viewing at PNCA till 13 February 2024.
