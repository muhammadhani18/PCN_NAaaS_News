• List of candidates includes at least 20 women and 20 lawyers; all except Qureshi to contest from one constituency
• PTI may ally with influential parties in specific regions, seek support from independents
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), facing uncertainty over the retention of its ‘bat’ symbol, issued a list of its candidates for 234 of the total 266 National Assembly seats on Friday for the upco­ming general elections.
The list, which includes 20 women and 20 advocates, was released by the party’s central secretariat.
While the line-up features several prominent PTI leaders and former legislators, it also introduces new faces, including notable lawyers like Sardar Latif Khosa and Salman Akram Raja.
 






PTI Information Secre­tary Rauf Hassan told Dawn the list could be modified following the Supreme Court’s verdict on the allotment of the ‘bat’ symbol.
However, a party spokesman told Dawn it had already made adjustments with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC-Sherani) and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Pakistan (MWM), and their candidates had also been adjusted in the list of PTI candidates.
 
 

The decision on 32 constituencies remains pending, with expectations of an updated list soon to include candidates for these areas.
Mr Hassan elaborated on PTI’s plans, which include adjustments with influential parties in specific regions and seek support from independent candidates. “We can go for both plans, allies and independent candidates,” he said.
According to the PTI’s list of candidates, no one will contest elections from more than one seat except PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi.
The party has also made some changes to its previous list of candidates, as those who are not contesting from their previous constituencies have been replaced by their family members. For instance, Mian Azhar, a former Punjab governor, has been awarded a party ticket in place of his son, Hammad Azhar.
The PTI has given tickets to 20 women, including Kanwal Shauzab (from Bahawalpur-III), Shandana Gulzar (Peshawar-III), Eman Tahir (Attock-III), Seemabia Tahir (Rawalpindi-VI), Rehana Imtiaz Dar (Sialkot-II), Aliya Hamza (Lahore-II), Dr Yasmeen Rashid (Lahore-XIV), Sidra Faisal (Kasur-IV), and Ayesha Nazir Jutt (Vehari-I).
Other women candidates are Qamar Javed Warraich (Rahim Yar Khan-IV), Humaira Ahmed Khan (Muzaffargarh-II), Amber Majeed Niazi (Layyah-I), Zartaj Gul Wazir (D.G. Khan-II), Naheed Khawar (Kamber Shahdadkot-II), Ambareen Malik (Khairpur-I), Hameeda Shah (Sanghar-I), Meharun Nisa Baloch (Tharparkar-II), Nazish Bhatti (Matiari), Rozina Bhutto (Tando Allahyar) and Shabana Nawab (Dadu-I).
Other old and new prominent faces in the list of candidates are Omar Ayub Khan (Haripur), Murad Saeed/Kamal Khan Advocate (Swat-III) Saleemur Rehman (Swat-II), Sibghatullah (Upper Dir), Mehboob Shah (Lower Dir-I), Junaid Akbar (Malakand), Asad Qaisar (Swabi-I), Shahram Tarakai (Swabi-II), Ali Muhammad Khan (Mardan-III), Sajid Khan (Mohmand), Arbab Sher Ali (Peshawar IV), Shehriyar Afridi (Kohat) and Ali Amin Gandapur (D.I. Khan-I).
Others included Aamir Masood Mughal (Islamabad-I), Tahir Sadiq (Attock-I), Raja Basharat (Rawalpindi-IV), Shahriyar Riaz (Rawalpindi-V), Ayaz Amir (Chakwal), Ali Sajid Malhi (Sialkot-IV), retired Col Javed Kholoon (Narowal-II), Riaz Fatiyana (Toba Tek Singh-III), Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan (Jhang-I), Sheikh Waqar Akram, (Jhang-II), retired Brig Ejaz Shah (Nankana Sahib-I), Mian Azhar (Lahore-XIII), Malik Amir Dogar (Multan-II), Zain Qureshi (Multan-III), Shah Mahmood Qureshi/Mehr Bano Qureshi (Multan-IV), Mr Qureshi (Tharparkar-I), Shaukat Basra/Talat Mehmood Basra (Bahawalnagar-IV), and Samiullah Chaudhry (Bahawalpur-V).
Some other PTI candidates for the National Assembly seats will be Jamshaid Dasti (Muzaffargarh-I), Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood (Taunsa), Saifullah Abro (Larkana-I), Lalchand Malhi (Umerkot), Aleem Adil Sheikh (Karachi Korangi-I), Faheem Khan (Karachi-Korangi-III), Muhammad Alamgir Khan (Karachi-East-II), Aleem Adil Sheikh (Karachi-East-IV) and Khurram Sher Zaman (Karachi-South-III).
Prominent lawyers in the list of PTI election candidates are Barrister Gohar Ali Khan (from Buner), Latif Khosa (Lahore-VI), Salman Akram Raja (Lahore-XII), Shoaib Shaheen (Islamabad-II) Sher Afzal Marwat (Lakki Marwat), Ali Bukhari (Islamabad-III), Advocate Haris Meo (Karachi Korangi-II), Shafqat Awan Advocate (Sargodha-III), Khudadad Kalyar Advocate (Sargodha-IV), Akram Niazi Advocate (Khushab-II), Afzal Azeem Pahat (Lahore-VII), Zameen Jedho Advocate (Lahore-VIII), Barrister Taimur Malik (Multan-I), Mumtaz Mustafa Advocate (Rahim Yar Khan-III), Barrister Nabeel Dharr (Rahim Yar Khan V), Advocate Aftab Soomro (Shikarpur), Advocate Zahoor Mehsud (Karachi-East-III), Advocate Shujaat Ali Khan (Karachi-Keamari-II), and Barrister Uzair Ghauri (Karachi-Central-III).

1,"Denying voting right will lead to dictatorship, warns CJP","ECP lawyer tells SC PTI held intra-party polls in a ""secretive"" manner; ""no doubt"" party members facing hardship, CJP observes.","• ECP lawyer tells SC PTI held intra-party polls in a ‘secretive’ manner
• Party counsel says ‘extraordinary’ situation prevented intra-party polls from being held in big cities
• ‘No doubt’ party members facing hardship, CJP observes  • PHC puts ECP chief on notice in contempt plea
ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa on Friday observed that every citizen has a fundamental right to vote for a political party of his choice and likewise every member of any political party enjoys the same right — a right if snatched would mean dictatorship.
“Democracy is a fundamental right, which should be practised both in the country as well as the political party,” the CJP observed while heading a three-judge Supreme Court bench that had taken up a hurriedly-moved appeal by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) challenging the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) decision to restore the PTI’s election symbol — bat.
Separately, the PHC issued notices to the chief election commissioner and other ECP members seeking replies to a contempt petition that PTI had filed against them for not implementing the high court’s order in the intra-party polls case.
 


CJP Isa while pointing towards senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, who represented ECP, wondered whether the poll watchdog was discriminating against PTI by overseeing its intra-party polls and whether the same treatment had been meted out to other political parties or not. “We are only concerned whether the commission was guilty of pick and choose or not,” the CJP said.
The counsel denied PTI was being discriminated against, adding the ECP had delisted 13 other political parties as well. He contended that ECP was only interested to see whether the intra-party elections conducted by PTI were done in a fair and transparent manner which, according to the commission, were not.
Mr Makhdoom contended that PTI had held the intra-party polls in a secretive manner and they were not conducted in accordance with its own constitution.
Besides, all office-bearers had been elected unopposed and declared successful by election commissioner Niazullah Khan Niazi with his signature though all the six provincial election commissioners should have also affixed their signatures on the election results, he added.
The court wondered why the intra-party elections were held at a cricket ground in the Chamkani area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and how the members had been disseminated the information where to gather to vote.
Intra-party polls defended
Senior counsel Hamid Khan, on behalf of PTI, argued that the court should realise the extraordinary situation in which the PTI members were surviving.
 
 

He said when party members and workers were being harassed, or picked up, it was not possible to hold the intra-party elections in cities like Islamabad or Lahore.
Mr Niazi informed the court that the party workers and members were communicated about the election through WhatsApp, adding “we also had a video which could be played in court to ascertain how many people participated in the intra-party polls”.
No doubt the party members were facing hardship, the CJP observed, adding that courts will always intervene if they approached the relevant courts against the injustices.
The court postponed the proceedings for Saturday (today), saying the case is time-sensitive with Feb 8 elections round the corner.
Mr Makhdoom contended that ECP had received 14 complaints against PTI’s intra-party polls which were filed by party members.
He contended that Omar Ayub currently held the office of PTI’s secretary general but ECP acknowledges Asad Umar as secretary general, adding that personal statements about quitting the party were presented but there was nothing on record that Mr Umar had quit the office.
Ahmad Hassan, representing Akbar S. Babar, said his client was a founding member of PTI.
“Then why is he not a PTI member,” wondered the CJP and asked Hamid Khan whether Mr Babar was expelled from the party.
But Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar observed that in his view a founding member was never expelled from the party.
Contempt case
In Peshawar, the high court put on notice the chief election commissioner and ECP members seeking their replies to the contempt petition of PTI against them for not implementing the PHC’s order in the intra-party polls case.
A two-member bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Wiqar Ahmad fixed Jan 16 for next hearing of the petition.
Senior lawyers Qazi Muhammad Anwar and Shah Faisal Ilyas requested the bench to punish the respondents for not complying with the directions passed by the court on Jan 10.
They stated that while setting aside the ECP’s Dec 22 order of nullifying the PTI’s intra-party polls and revoking its electoral symbol, the high court had ordered the ECP to publish the certificate of PTI’s polls on its website forthwith.
They said the court had also declared that PTI entitled to get the election symbol ‘bat’ strictly in terms of Sections 215 and 217 of the Elections Act.
Qazi Anwar, who is provincial chief of PTI’s legal wing, Insaf Lawyers Forum, stated that respondents were fully aware of the PHC’s order and yet did not issue a certificate of PTI on its website, which amounted to contempt of the court.

2,Govt to appeal SC ruling hindering Supreme Judicial Council action against former judges,The 2023 Afiya Shehrbano Zia judgment had held that judges who retire or resign do not fall within the ambit of Article 209 of the Constitution.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government is contemplating instituting an appeal before the Supreme Court against its 2023 Afiya Shehrbano Zia judgement, which held that judges who retire or resign do not fall within the ambit of Article 209 of the Constitution that determines misconduct of superior court judges.
The information was laid by Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan before a five-member Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Friday that held its meeting in an open court to consider whether it should continue proceedings of misconduct against a former Supreme Court judge, Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, who resigned on Jan 10.
 
 

The AGP explained before the council that his attention was drawn towards the judgement recently and he was informed by the federal government that it was pondering moving an appeal against the verdict.
The SJC — headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justices Sardar Tariq Masood, Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Balochistan High Court Chief Justice (CJ) Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Lahore High Court CJ Muhammad Ameer Bhatti — postponed further proceedings for Monday (Feb 15) since an apex court bench headed by CJP Isa had to take up an election matter relating to the PTI about its election symbol ‘bat’.
Senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed on behalf of Justice Naqvi could also not reach the court in time since the Lahore-Islamabad motorway was closed due to smog.
 
 

Dr Yasir Rehman told the council that the senior counsel was on his way to the court and would reach in a few hours. He said the SJC could not conduct an inquiry against the resigned judge and therefore the council should not proceed against Justice Naqvi since he was no longer in office.
On Thursday, AGP Awan had told the council that the division bench which had taken the petition of Shehrbano Zia, consisting of now-retired Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, had decided the matter in limine without issuing a notice to the AGP office under Rule 27A of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) or the respondents.
Besides, the decision had come on June 27, 2023, when the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 was enacted which stipulated that petitions under Article 184(3) of the Constitution could only be heard by a bench not less than three judges, the AGP had argued, adding that though the act’s operation was stayed, the bench could have waited for the outcome of appeals against the act.
Advocate Hina Jilani had argued on Ms Zia’s behalf before the division bench that any reference or a complaint against a superior court judge under Article 209 of the Constitution abated in case the judge either retired or resigned before the council furnished its recommendation to the president against the judge.

3,"With ‘bat’ in danger, PTI looks to ‘batsman’",Chalks out a plan B: forging an alliance with its splinter PTI-Nazriati group to use the ‘batsman’ symbol.,"CHAKWAL: After sensing the danger of losing its iconic symbol ‘bat’, the embattled Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has chalked out a plan B: forging an alliance with its splinter PTI-Nazriati group to use the ‘batsman’ symbol for its candidates, Dawn learnt on Friday.
Sources privy to the developments said that an accord had been reached between the two parties after negotiations.
“After the Election Commission of Pakistan went to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Peshawar High Court, the party’s leadership mulled over the option for an alternative electoral symbol,” a source in the PTI told Dawn. “The need was aggravated after remarks passed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa during a hearing on Friday.”
PTI officials believe that the ‘bat’ and ‘batsman’ symbols are similar, making it easier for voters to identify with PTI, the source explained.
“The chairman of PTI-Nazriati, Akhtar Iqbal Dar, has agreed to issue tickets to PTI’s candidates on the symbol of batsman,” another source said.
The PTI leadership took the decision to woo the Nazriati group, considering the possibility that the Election Commission of Pakistan would grant separate symbols to each party candidate, which would confuse voters.
“If the bat is denied, the PTI could inculcate easily in the voters’ minds to stamp on the batsman,” the source said.
Interestingly, the PTI initially never wanted the “batsman” symbol allocated to its splinter group. It urged the ECP in June 2022 not to allot the symbol to PTI-Nazriati, arguing that it would create confusion among the voters. However, the ECP did not entertain PTI’s request.
The sources could not confirm the conditions under which PTI-Nazriati agreed to issue its tickets to PTI’s candidates.
When contacted, a PTI-Nazriati official, who answered the call on the cell number of party chairman Akhtar Iqbal Dar, refused to comment. “We cannot comment on this issue right now,” he said.
A spokesman for the PTI said the party was ready to accommodate some of the PTI-Nazriati candidates, hoping that its list of demands would not be a long one.
 
 

However, he said the party would make a final decision only after the Supreme Court’s decision, which is expected to be announced today (Saturday). He said the party hoped to get a favourable decision from the apex court.
This new possible arrangement between the two parties could spell trouble for those PTI-Nazriati candidates who had already got election tickets in constituencies where the PTI is fielding its candidates.
For example, in Chakwal’s NA-58 constituency, PTI-Nazriati has already issued a ticket to Chaudhry Imran Qaisar Abbas, whereas veteran columnist and former MNA Ayaz Amir has also submitted papers from the same constituency.
Under this new arrangement and in case of adverse verdict by the apex court, the PTI-Nazriati’s candidate in NA-58 is likely to be made a scapegoat. And if he manages to submit his ticket today (Saturday) before the Supreme Court’s decision, it will bring trouble for Ayaz Amir and Ali Nasir Bhatti.
Mr Abbas told Dawn on Friday night that he and Mohammad Ejazul Haq had got NA-58 and PP-20 tickets, respectively, which they would submit to the returning officers on Saturday morning.
ECP ‘has two lenses’
PTI-Nazriati was established in January 2012 after Mr Dar developed differences with PTI founder Imran Khan, claiming that the PTI had become a party of turncoats. As per the election schedule, candidates are bound to submit party tickets before Jan 13.
“The deadline has been approached, but our symbol has not been decided yet,” a PTI leader said, fearing that PTI’s candidates might not be able to submit tickets to returning officers.
Talking to the media in Islamabad on Friday, PTI’s Barrister Gohar Khan, looking dejected over the possible danger of losing the bat symbol, said that it was a constitutional requirement that every political party must have an electoral symbol.
 






“We have conducted elections (intra-party) at least, whereas not a single political party out of 175 parties conducted elections at all,” he claimed. “But the ECP has two lenses. With one lens, it looks at all other 175 parties, while it looks at the PTI with the second lens.”
He added that the symbol of not a single political party was snatched on such grounds that it was snatched from PTI. “The ECP never brought such reputed lawyers in the Supreme Court as it has brought against the PTI,” he said, adding that if the PTI were denied an electoral symbol, the world would not recognise the upcoming polls.

4,"‘Panicked’ by ‘N’ decision, Q-League breaks alliance",‘Q’ accuses PML-N of having double standards; ‘N’ trying to remove Chaudhrys’ concerns.,"LAHORE: Baffled by the PML-N decision of not ‘honouring’ the seat adjustment formula, PML-Q has accused the former of practising double standards and decided to go solo in the Feb 8 elections.
Since PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif visited PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain on Dec 6, there was a buzz that both parties would go into the polls as an alliance and the former would not field its candidates on four National Assembly and eight Punjab Assembly constituencies to keep the field open for PML-Q.
However, PML-N only decided not to field its candidates against Chaudhry Shujaat’s sons Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Chaudhry Shafay Hussain (in Gujrat), irking the Q-League.
The PML-Q leaders immediately held a meeting and decided to break the electoral alliance with PML-N. However, the Sharifs are said to be trying to address their concerns.

‘Q’ accuses PML-N of having double standards; ‘N’ trying to remove Chaudhrys’ concerns

Visibly perturbed over the new situation, Chaudhry Salik tweeted that “the PML-N should also issue its party tickets to its candidates against me and my brother Chaudhry Shafay Hussain as we are ready for the electoral clash without any seat adjustment with the PML-N”.
“The PML-Q candidates are standing tall with the party and the party will reciprocate by standing with them and go ahead against the PML-N in elections,” Mr Salik wrote.
Giving details of the understanding, PML-Q Punjab general secretary Shafay Hussain recalled that senior leaders of the two parties had held detailed discussions on the issue and thrashed out all constituencies district-wise and agreed that PML-N would leave four NA and eight PA constituencies open for the Q-League but now it has backed out of the agreement.
 
 

“The PML-N leaders’ team comprising Rana Sanaullah, Ayaz Sadiq, Atta Tarar and Azam Nazir Tarar had committed to leave four NA and eight PA seats open, but the PML-N abruptly fielded its candidates on all the seats leaving our candidates shocked and alarmed,” Mr Shafay said.
Asserting that PML-N did not convey anything about its change of heart, Mr Shafay said that PML-Q candidates panicked and an impression seemed going down the party ranks that the Q-League leaders only entered into the deal for their personal benefit, which was not acceptable at all.
Immediately, the PML-Q general secretary said, the party decided that all candidates, including those on hold, should gear up to contest the elections. He said the party might contest elections from at least 12 seats.
He said Salik Hussain was running for an NA seat and he himself for a PA seat from Gujrat.
He further said that PML-Q had identified seats for adjustment in Gujrat, Jhang, Sialkot and Bahawalpur.
Responding to the PML-Q ‘threat’ to sever the electoral alliance, PML-N deputy secretary general Attaullah Tarar said the party had approached the PML-Q and is trying to placate its leadership.
“Award of tickets is a difficult stage…however, there has been no deadlock as we are positive that the concerns of the Q-League will be addressed and it will go along with the PML-N,” he added. While PML-N has left two NA and as many PA seats open for PML-Q, a PML-N leader said Q-League leaders were demanding more seats for national and provincial assemblies, which in a current situation was not possible.
“In comparison with the IPP, we have rather generously accommodated the PML-Q,” a PML-N leader told Dawn on Thursday.
The PML-Q had not finalised its candidates to field in national and provincial assemblies’ constituencies till the filing of this report late in the night.
“The PML-Q candidates list is not finalised yet,” Shafay Hussain told Dawn.

5,ROs to allocate poll symbols today,Ticket denials spark wave of independent candidacies; PkMAP chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai withdraws in favour of Fazlur Rehman.,"ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Marking an important phase of the general elections due in less than a month, returning officers (ROs) will allocate poll symbols to electoral candidates today (Saturday).
This phase will coincide with a crucial hearing at the Supreme Court to decide if the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) will play its election innings with or without “bat”.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has already sent a list of 145 symbols to be allotted to candidates belonging to various political parties, along with a separate list for independent candidates. In a related development, the ECP on Friday delisted 13 political parties for failure to hold intra-party elections and allowed two political parties to participate in the general elections.
The five-member bench of the commission, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, announced the reserved judgements regarding the case of intra-party elections of 15 political parties.

Ticket denials spark wave of independent candidacies; Achakzai withdraws in favour of Fazlur Rehman

Through its verdicts, the ECP has allotted an election symbol to Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah), while Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Noorani has also been allowed to contest the elections. JUI-N was allowed to contest polls after it addressed the observations pointed out by the ECP office. Likewise, PML-J got the nod after its request for condoning a delay of one and a half months in relation to the intra-party polls and office-bearers was accepted.
However, All Pakistan Minority Alliance, All Pakistan Tehreek, Awami Party Pakistan, Bahawalpur National Awami Party, Sabka Pakistan, National Peace Council Party, Pakistan National Muslim League, Pakistan Aman Party, Pakistan Barabari Party, Christian Awami Party, Pakistan National Solidarity Party, Sunni Tehreek, and Nizam-i-Mustafa Party have been delisted for not holding intra-party polls.
Disgruntled figures refuse to leave field In an interesting turn of events, many candidates from political parties have announced their intention to contest polls as independent candidates after being denied party tickets.
Sumera Malik, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Punjab vice president, said that she would contest NA-87 as an independent candidate. Ms Malik also mentioned that her other group members would also contest independently from the district, as the PML-N had favoured Shakir Awan over her.
Earlier, PML-N stalwart Daniyal Aziz announced his independent candidacy from NA-75, Narowal, where the PML-N had awarded a ticket to Chaudhry Anwaarul Haq. Mr Aziz added that his wife would also contest independently for a provincial assembly seat in Narowal.
 
 

Ayesha Rajab Baloch, a former PML-N lawmaker from Faisalabad, was also denied a party ticket and has announced her intention to contest the elections independently.
The Sharifs’ party has announced its candidates for most National and Punjab Assembly seats across the province, favouring electables from the south and PTI defectors.
In some constituencies, potential PML-N candidates protested against the leadership for depriving them of tickets to accommodate “turncoats” and others.
PPP ticket aspirants
A local leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Dr Irfan Gul Magsi, who failed to secure the party’s ticket for any seat, did not withdraw his nomination papers filed for three constituencies in Hyderabad district.
 
 

Dr Magsi had submitted forms for PS-60 (Qasimabad), PS-64 (Hyderabad city), and NA-220 (Hyderabad city). The PPP has awarded the ticket to Jam Khan Shoro for PS-60, Mukhtiar Ahmed alias Aajiz Dhamra for PS-64, and Wasim Rajput for NA-220.
In the general polls of July 2018, Dr Magsi was awarded the ticket for NA-220 but was later asked to withdraw the papers in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan-Noorani’s Sahibzada Abul Khair Mohammad Zubair, who, however, lost to MQM.
Nawab Muhammad Khan Shahwani is contesting as an independent candidate from NA-261 Mastung-Kalat and PB-37 Mastung after not being awarded a ticket by the PPP. Tahir Mehmood, Liaquat Lehri, and Sana Durrani, a prominent PPP woman wing leader, were also contesting independently.
JUI-F and PkMAP seat adjustment
Separately, in a relevant development, Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai has withdrawn his nomination papers in favour of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman from NA-265 (Pishin).
The JUI-F chief is contesting the National Assembly election for the first time outside his home constituency, Dera Ismail Khan, and has chosen NA-265 (Pishin) in Balochistan, considering it a stronghold of JUI-F.
He is also contesting the election for the National Assembly from his home constituency, where he had lost in 2018 against PTI’s Amin Gandapur.
 
 

Mr Achakzai had filed his nomination papers from NA-265 (Pishin) and NA-263 (Quetta).
However, in view of an understanding between JUI-F and PkMAP, it was decided that Mr Achakzai would support Maulana Rehman at NA-265, and JUI-F would withdraw its candidate at NA-263 against Mr Achakzai.
After the withdrawal of Mr Achakzai’s nomination papers from Pishin, the JUI-F senior leader Mufti Rozi Khan withdrew his nomination papers from NA-263.

6,"US, UK strikes on Yemen threaten regional conflagration","Military bases, a naval base and military sites targeted; not all major American allies back the strikes.","• Military bases, a naval base and military sites targeted
• Not all major American allies back the strikes, S. Arabia calls for restraint
WASHINGTON: US and British warplanes, ships and submarines launched dozens of air strikes across Yemen overnight in retaliation against Houthi forces for months of attacks on Red Sea shipping that the Iran-backed fighters cast as a response to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.
Witnesses confirmed explosions at military bases near airports in the capital Sanaa and Yemen’s third city Taiz, a naval base at Yemen’s main Red Sea port Hodeidah and military sites in the coastal Hajjah governorate.
 
 

“These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,” President Joe Biden said.
White House spokesman John Kirby said the strikes had targeted the Houthis’ ability to store, launch and guide missiles or drones, and that their impact was being assessed.
The Houthis, who have controlled most of Yemen for nearly a decade, said that five fighters had been killed in a total of 73 air strikes. They vowed to retaliate and continue their attacks on shipping, which they say are intended to support Palestinians against Israel.
Shortly after 1500 GMT, the UK Maritime Trade Operations information hub said it had received reports of a missile landing in the sea around 500 metres (1,600 feet) from a ship about 90 nautical miles southeast of the Yemeni port of Aden. Three small boats were also reported to have neared the vessel.
The shipping security firm Ambrey identified it as a Panama-flagged tanker.
In Yemen, crowds gathered in cities. Drone footage on the Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV showed hundreds of thousands of people in Sanaa carrying Palestinian and Yemeni flags and chanting slogans denouncing Israel and the United States.
“Your strikes on Yemen are terrorism,” said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council. “The United States is the Devil.”
 


The US military said 60 targets at 16 locations had been hit using more than 100 precision-guided munitions.
In a poor country only just emerging from nearly a decade of war that brought millions to the brink of famine, people fearing an extended new conflict queued at petrol stations.
 
 

“There is a lot of worry that the fuel shortages will repeat themselves and food supplies will be scarce,” said Ali Ahmad, 52. “We are rushing to fuel our car and we bought flour and rice in case of any emergency because we are exp­ecting the Houthis to respond and an escalation to take place.”
In Hodeidah, a resident who gave only his first name, Mahmoud, said troops were spreading through the streets and military vehicles were leaving barracks with security escorts.
The price of oil rose sharply on concern that supplies could be disrupted, with Brent crude up more than $2. Commercial ship tracking data showed at least nine oil tankers stopping or diverting from the Red Sea.
The strikes follow months of raids by Houthi fighters, who have boarded ships they claimed were Israeli or heading for Israel.
The United States and some allies deployed a naval task force to the area last month, and recent days saw increasing escalation. US helicopters sank three Houthi boats on New Year’s Eve, killing fighters attempting to board a ship. On Tuesday, the United States and Britain shot down 21 missiles and drones in what they called the biggest attack yet.
However, not all major US allies chose to back the strikes.
The Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Bahrain provided logistical and intelligence support, while Germany, Denmark, New Zealand and South Korea signed a joint statement defending the attacks and warning of further action.
But Italy, Spain and France chose not to sign or participate, fearing a wider escalation.
Egypt, which controls the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Medit­erranean, expressed deep concern. Saudi Arabia, which has sought for nearly a decade to oust the Houthis in a war that is now in a delicate stage of peace negotiations, called for restraint.
A senior US official accused Iran of providing the Houthis with military capabilities and intelligence to carry out their attacks. Iran condemned the strikes.
Within hours of the air strikes, the US Treasury Department issued sanctions targeting four oil tankers and two firms whose shipments it said were helping to finance the Houthis and Iran’s Quds Force.
Fears of escalation
Houthi attacks have forced commercial ships to take a longer, costlier route around Africa, creating fears of a new bout of inflation and supply chain disruption.  Container shipping rates for key global routes have soared this week.
Carmakers Tesla and Volvo, owned by China’s Geely, said delays to parts shipments from Asia had forced them to suspend some production in Germany and Belgium respectively, the first big manufacturers to make such announcements.
Washington has had to weigh its determination to keep the shipping lane open, and protect a fragile global economic recovery, against the risk of spreading unrest in a region already on edge.
It is unclear whether the strikes will in fact deter further attacks on shipping, said Tobias Borck, a Middle East security expert at Britain’s Royal United Services Institute.
The Houthis wanted to portray themselves as champions of the Palestinian cause and foes of the West, but were mainly concerned about retaining power.
“Is this the hill they want to die on?” said Borck. “They were doing well, they have been able to survive the last eight years, have expanded their power, but now they are inviting air strikes from the world’s most powerful military.”
