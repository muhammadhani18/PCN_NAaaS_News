0,Another coronavirus variant rears its head in Pakistan,"Vaccines scarce, precautions challenging amid variant spread","Just when Pakistan had all but forgotten about the novel coronavirus, the latest variant of the infectious disease has been detected in the country, which poses a significant threat to the perpetually overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure of the land.
While provincial health departments have just sprung into action to combat the spread of the COVID-19 JN.1 variant, which is already spreading vigorously across the United States of America, they might not have the required infrastructure to curtail the virus successfully.
For instance, the Spokesman of the Sindh Health Department informed the Express Tribune that the provincial capital, Karachi, did not have COVID-19 vaccines on hand since October of 2023. “Recently, 2 passengers who arrived at Karachi Airport have tested positive for the JN. 1 variant of the infectious disease. In light of this rising trend, we are hoping that the federal government dispatches vaccines to us soon,” he explained.
Similarly, as per health department sources in Punjab, who spoke with the Express Tribune on condition of anonymity, no official guidelines have been issued for mandatory testing as of yet in the province. “Only 1 person has been diagnosed with the new variant so far in the province but in the absence of designated testing points at coronavirus hotspots like the airport, the variant might spread,” the source cautioned.
However, in stark contrast to the country’s most populous province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) claims that it is well prepared. Dr Irshad Roghani, Director of the Public Health Department, when quizzed about the spread of the coronavirus, said that teams of the health department were present at the Peshawar Airport to test for the new variant. “There are no cases in K-P right now and even if there were, we are prepared to combat the disease,” assured Dr Roghani.
Although Dr Roghani’s confidence in the provincial health department is more profound than that of his peers at other provincial departments, Dr Abdul Waheed Rajput, Director of the Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital, believes that the country as a whole is not ready to combat another wave of the coronavirus.
“For the past two years people across the country have abandoned all preventive measures against the superspreader. Now for them to adopt precautionary measures like those being enforced by the government in the lockdown period would be a tall ask,” asserted Dr Rajput.

Since precautionary measures would be hard to enforce and vaccines are unavailable, Dr Rajput feels that the cold weather will aid the spread of the JN. 1 variant, especially in the elderly and immunocompromised segment of the populace.
Therefore, people should be on alert if they have symptoms like high fever, cold, cough, chest congestion, and shortness of breath, according to Dr Pir Ghulam Nabi Shah Jilani, Medical Superintendent (MS) of the Sindh Government Hospital, Saudabad. “I would also suggest that people should start masking up and practise social distancing. Most importantly, I would recommend people to get a booster dose immediately,” implored Dr Jilani.
However, booster doses are not as readily available anywhere in the country presently. According to the focal person on the coronavirus for the Punjab Health Department, Dr. Yadullah Ali, currently only the first dose of vaccine is being administered across the province and that too as an emergency for high-risk individuals.
“Similarly, Hajj and Umrah pilgrims and those suffering from respiratory and heart diseases will be prioritised. Only after these groups have been provided for, the second dose of the vaccine will be administered.”
Nevertheless, Dr Ali, was quick to add that Punjab would now start testing for Covid-19’s new variant at the airport and that every district of the province had been directed to increase testing.
As per, Dr Ikram Ullah Khan, an official of the K-P Health Department, the same is being done in the province as well. “The Secretary of the Health Department and other high officials have already directed all the concerned departments to take the new variant seriously,” said Dr Khan.
While it is not clear how the provinces will curtail the spread of the virus without an adequate supply of vaccines, the Director General (DG) Health for Sindh has recently passed similar directions. “We have directed special wards to be established at all DHQs and THQs and will also increase surveillance of COVID-19,” assured the DG while talking to the Express Tribune.

1,PTI stirs political pot with surprise candidate selections,Several stalwarts omitted for Feb 8 elections; party breaks ties with Sheikh Rashid,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) caused a political stir on Friday with its announcement of candidates for the February 8 elections. The surprise selections, marked by notable omissions and unexpected choices, fueled debates on the party's strategy and internal dynamics.Under the leadership of Gauhar Khan, PTI issued party tickets for the National Assembly, Punjab Assembly, and Sindh Assembly. While candidates were announced for 233 out of 266 general seats in the National Assembly, 213 out of 297 general seats in the Punjab Assembly, and 122 out of 130 general seats in the Sindh Assembly, the party notably refrained from making seat adjustments with former ally Sheikh Rashid.
The decision not to grant a ticket to veteran politician Babar Awan for the Islamabad constituency raised eyebrows, with Ali Bukhari chosen instead of Ilyas Mehrban. In Lahore, the surprising move saw former education minister Shafqat Mahmood withdraw from the race after being denied a ticket.
Adding to the controversy, PTI went head-to-head with Sheikh Rashid Ahmed in Rawalpindi, fielding candidates against him in both NA-56 and NA-57, instead of forming an alliance as in previous elections. Seemabiya Tahir was chosen to challenge Rashid in NA-57, and Shehryar Riaz in NA-56.According to the PTI announcement, Chairman Barrister Gauhar Khan will contest from NA-10, Latif Khosa from NA-122, Shoaib Shaheen from NA-47, and Salman Akram Raja Advocate from NA-128. Retained candidates from the previous parliament include Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Yasmin Rashid, Omar Ayub, Murad Saeed, Ali Muhammad Khan, Ali Amin Gandapur, Shehryar Afridi, and Asad Qaiser.

2,Sharifs get lion's share of Lahore seats,"Khokhar family, known for close ties with Nawaz and Maryam, emerges as most favoured kin","The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Friday finally lifted the curtain on its Lahore tickets and with 41 seats up for grabs, the Sharif family retained eight seats exclusively just for itself – seemingly turning the electoral battleground into a family fiesta while leaving tongues wagging within the party.
The party also left the field open in two Lahore constituencies for IPP. Meanwhile, its another ally, PML-Q, which had once bet its political survival on saving the PML-N-led government, called off seat adjustment with it owing a paltry offering of seats.
However, the Khokhar family, renowned for their close ties with the party chief and his daughter, emerged as the most favourite, securing seven seats, including two national and five provincial.
The party also accommodated both its senior leaders Sheikh Rohail Asghar and former National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq on NA constituencies, after the former refused to give up his seat for the latter, forcing the party to accommodate the latter on a neighbouring constituency NA 120, according to PML-N office bearer.
It also left two seats NA-117 and NA-128 open for IPP. According to IPP leadership, these seats were left open for IPP President Aleem Khan and Awn Chaudary.
PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, as per the notification, would be contesting from NA-130, party president from NA-123 and PP-164, PP-158.
Shehbaz Sharif would also be contesting from Kasur NA-132. Interestingly, he opted out of the race for NA-242 Karachi, realising that securing victory without the backing of local player would be difficult.
Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz would be vying for election in NA-119 and PP-159. Simultaneously, Hamza Shehbaz is set to compete in NA-118 and PP-147, a provincial assembly seat falling within NA-117, a constituency left open for IPP President Aleem Khan.

Khokhar brothers
The Khokhar siblings secured a surprising number of seats in Lahore, exceeding the expectations of many observers.
Muhammad Afzal Khokhar got NA-125 while his elder brother Malik Saiful Malook Khokhar got NA-126. Besides, their family was given four provincial assembly seats.
Known for being financiers of elder Sharif, the allocation of this many tickets has raised many eyebrows in the party.
A former parliamentarian pointed out that senior party workers, such as former MNA Waheed Alam Khan, were completely overlooked, and there was potential for their accommodation in these seats.
In a striking example, the constituency where Waheed enjoys significant support was instead assigned to PML-N Deputy General Secretary Ata Tarar.
However, the party announced a Senate ticket for its leader Talal Chaudary, who hails from Faisalabad, especially after his seat was allocated to PTI defectors Nawab Sher Waseer.
Initially, it was being speculated that Awn had shown interest in NA-124. However, talking to The Express Tribune, he confirmed that he had in fact sought NA-128 for himself.
He said IPP was given seven MNA seats and 11 MPA seats. He sounded satisfied with the seat adjustment with PML-N, contrary to the reports in media suggesting that IPP was unhappy with adjustment on less than two dozen seats.
Contrary to IPP which was largely keeping a lid on its feelings, PML-Q came down hard on PML-N for not giving them enough seats. The PML-Q asked PML-N to keep the few seats it had left open for PML-Q for itself.
IPP leader Raja Yawar said that they were satisfied with the number of seats, adding that they had never asked for 100 seats from PML-N as was being reported by media.
He said they had asked for 30 NA and 40 MPA seats. However, they were aware that PML-N might not agree to all these seats. He said on his seat PP-24, PML-N candidate withdrew his nomination papers in accordance with the understanding with PML-N.

3,"Five soldiers martyred, seven terrorists killed","Security forces conduct separate operations in Balochistan, K-P","Five Pakistan Army soldiers were martyred while seven terrorists “were sent to hell” during separate operations conducted by the security forces in the general area of Buleda, Kech district, Balochistan and Mir Ali area of North Waziristan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations on Saturday, “Terrorists (in Buleda) exploded an improvised explosive device on a security forces’ vehicle, which was followed by an intense fire exchange.”
The military’s media wing said, “Own troops immediately responded and effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, as a result of which three terrorists were sent to hell. However, during the operation, five brave soldiers, having fought gallantly, sacrificed their lives and embraced Shahadat.
“The Shuhada include Sepoy Tipu Razzaq (23 years old, resident of Sahiwal district); Sepoy Sunny Shaukat (24 years old, resident of Karachi district); Sepoy Shafi Ullah (23 years old, resident of Lasbela district); Lance Naik Tariq Ali (25 years old, resident of Orakzai district); and Sepoy Muhammad Tariq Khan (25 years old, resident of Mianwali district).”

The ISPR said, “Sanitisation operation is being carried out to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area.
“The security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts of sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve.”
Separately in K-P, four terrorists were “neutralised” in two successful operations conducted by the security forces.
The ISPR disclosed that an intelligence based operation took place in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan district.
In the course of this operation, a significant achievement was made as terrorist commander Tabassum, also known as Qadarman, and terrorist Sajid, alias Sarkandi, were eliminated following a fierce exchange of gunfire, the ISPR stated.
Simultaneously, in a joint operation conducted by security forces and the police in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, two additional terrorists met their end, the ISPR affirmed.
Recovered from the deceased terrorists were weapons, ammunition, and explosives. These individuals were actively engaged in various terrorist activities against security forces, including extortion and targeted killings of innocent civilians. They were high-priority targets for law enforcement agencies.
The ISPR noted that the local community had expressed appreciation for the operations and stood in full support of efforts to eliminate the menace of terrorism.
