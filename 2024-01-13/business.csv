0,"Govt raises onion MEP  to $1,200  per tonne","PEVA chief says exporters had been getting huge orders after the Indian ban, which caused a steep rise in local prices.","KARACHI: Amid thriving exports and rising domestic prices, the Ministry of Commerce has fixed the minimum export price (MEP) of onion at $1,200 per tonne (FOB).
All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters, Importers and Merchants Association (PFVA) Patron-in-Chief Abdul Waheed Ahmed said that the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan has issued a notification on Jan 12 quoting the commerce ministry, which also states that the export of onions will be allowed only under advance payment terms.
The national average price of onion has risen to Rs180-260 per kg during the week ending on Jan 11 from Rs160-250 in the preceding week, according to the PBS data.
When India imposed a ban on onion exports on Dec 8, 2023, the national average price of the vegetable in Pakistan was Rs130-220 per kg during the week ending Dec 7, 2023.
Mr Waheed said exporters had been getting huge orders after the Indian ban, which caused a steep rise in local prices.
He said exporters in a meeting with the commerce ministry on Friday proposed an upward revision in MEP from the existing $750 per tonne (FOB) with 100pc advance payments to avoid any losses to the growers, otherwise they would not grow onion next year besides bringing down local prices.
He expressed surprise as to why market committees were not controlling the rate and why the government departments appea­red helpless in exercising their duties of price stabilisation.
He believed that India could store its onions for three to four months as compared to the one-month storage time for Pakistani onions.
Pakistan needs to carry out R&D to develop better varieties of onion with longer shelf life to effectively control prices, he said.

1,Short-term inflation surpasses 44pc,"The weekly inflation remains above 41pc for the ninth week in a row, according to PBS.","ISLAMABAD: The short-term inflation surged 44.16 per cent year-on-year in the week ending on Jan 11, the steepest increase observed since May 2023, official data showed on Friday.
The persistent rise in inflation, observed in the first week of the new year, indicates no signs of deceleration in the near term. This spike is primarily fuelled by a surge in gas prices, electricity tariffs, and the cost of essential kitchen items.
The weekly inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) hit a record 48.35pc year-on-year in early May 2023 but then decelerated as low as 24.4pc in late Aug 2023 before surging past 40pc during the week ending on Nov 16, 2023. Since then, the SPI has remained above 41pc consecutively.
With the latest reading, the weekly inflation remained above 41pc for the ninth week in a row, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
The SPI witnessed a 1.36pc week-on-week increase as of Jan 11. This rise follows last week’s increase of 0.81pc.
On an annual basis, the items whose prices increased the most included gas charges for Q1 (1108.59pc), tomatoes (155.83pc), cigarettes (93.22pc), chillies powder (81.74pc), garlic (60.43pc), gents sponge chappal (58.05pc), sugar (57.20pc), wheat flour (55.26pc), gents sandal (53.37pc), rice Irri-6/9 (51.57pc), gur (50.58pc) and rice basmati broken (46.91pc).
In contrast, the prices of mustard oil dropped 7.10pc year-on-year, followed by onions (-6.68pc), vegetable ghee (1.67pc) and bananas (1.53pc).
The short-term, or weekly, inflation is measured by a basket of goods and services called the SPI, which stood at 317.82 compared to 313.66 in the preceding week and 220.53 a year ago.
The index, comprising 51 items collected from 50 markets in 17 cities, is computed weekly to assess the prices of essential commodities and services at shorter intervals. On a weekly basis, the SPI inflation was recorded at 1.36pc. Data showed that the prices of 21 items increased, those of eight items decreased and those of 22 items remained stable compared to the previous week.
The items whose prices saw the highest increase week-on-week included tomatoes (15.63pc), onions (8.94pc), chicken (6.42pc), electricity charges for Q1 (5.11pc), eggs (4.31pc), matchbox (2.56pc), gur (2.30pc), LPG (2.29pc), pulse gram (2.11pc), energy sever (1.40pc), pulse mash (0.83pc) and rice Irri-6/9 (0.67pc).
The items whose prices dropped the most over the previous week included potatoes (5.92pc), vegetable ghee 1kg (0.84pc), sugar (0.43pc), vegetable ghee 2.5kg (0.29pc), mustard oil (0.26pc), cooking oil five-litre (0.17pc), garlic (0.13pc) and pulse moong (0.06pc).

2,"Petrol, diesel likely to become cheaper by Rs10",Sources say the international prices of all petroleum products had declined.,"ISLAMABAD: The petrol price is estimated to decline by about Rs9-10 per litre on Jan 15 for the next fortnight due to a combination of lower international prices, exchange rate gains and a decline in premium. 
High-speed diesel (HSD) is also expected to be cheaper by around Rs2 per litre.
Informed sources said the prices of all petroleum products had declined in the international market over the past fortnight and the rupee had also gained against the US dollar while the premium on procurement of petrol had also come down.
The officials said the price of petrol had come down by more than a dollar from $84.50 to $83 per barrel over the last two weeks while HSD had become cheaper by about $1.10 per barrel from $97 to $95.85. The rupee on the other hand also gained against the dollar to Rs280.40 on Friday from about Rs283 in the last week of December. 
The premium paid by Pakistan State Oil (PSO) for securing product cargoes remained unchanged for HSD but dropped to $7.50 from $10.5 per barrel last month.
Therefore, the petrol price is estimated to be cheaper by at least Rs9 per litre and that of HSD by Rs2 per litre. The prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are also expected to reduce by about Rs2 per litre each.
The government has already achieved a Rs60 per litre petroleum levy — the maximum permissible limit under the law — on both petrol and HSD. The government had set a budget target to collect Rs869 billion as a petroleum levy during the current fiscal year under the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) but was hoping the collection to go beyond Rs950bn by the end of June.
Petroleum and electricity prices have been the key drivers of inflation, which clocked in at 29.7pc in December as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
At present, the government is charging about Rs82 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD. 
Although the general sales tax on all petroleum products is currently zero, the government is charging Rs60 per litre petroleum development levy on petrol and Rs50 each on HSD, high-octane blending component, and 95 research octane number (RON) petrol.

4,"Caretakers’ reckless gas, power tariff hikes to cripple industry, warns KCCI chief","KCCI chief says gas tariff has been constantly raised since October 2020, in addition to 40 pc increase in RLNG cost.","KARACHI: The interim government of Anwaarul Haq Kakar has raised industrial gas tariff by an unprecedented 118 per cent since August 2023 from Rs1,100 to Rs2,400 per mmBtu.
An additional rise of 40pc in RLNG cost has taken the gas tariff to a whopping and historically highest level of Rs3,200 per mmBtu, indicating an overall hike of 191pc.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh has said that as the industries have already been supply suspension for day days every week, the SSGCL has come up with another shock by disrupting supply on Friday and Saturday instead of the usual suspension on Saturday and Sunday.
SSGCL had closed gas supplies to the industries for 48 hours from Friday (8am) to Sunday (8am), citing short supplies of around 65 mmscfd from different gas fields last night. As a result, SSGCL’s line pack had severely depleted resulting in low gas pressures across franchise areas of Sindh and Balochistan. The company said it is still facing a short supply of around 20 mmscfd short from different gas fields.
“Is SSGC going to bear the cost incurred on overtime wages if we call our workers on Sunday for carrying out production?”, the KCCI chief asked.
He elaborated that since October 2020, the gas tariff, which stood at Rs819 per mmBtu, has constantly been raised and within a year, it has been increased to Rs2,400 per mmBtu whereas from January 2023, 40pc RLNG cost has also been added, taking industrial tariff to an unbearable Rs3,200 per mmBtu.
He said the Petroleum Division, which was in sheer disagreement with industries of Karachi at a stakeholders’ meeting held with the caretaker prime minister last month, has issued a notification to SSGCL to charge further up to 40pc for RLNG to industrial gas supply.
“It appears to be a clear-cut indication that someone intends to close all the industries in Karachi. The recurring exorbitant increases in the energy tariffs (gas and power) under IMF dictates and other costly industrial inputs due to mammoth rupee-dollar parity and deprivation of level playing field to compete globally have brought the industries to the verge of closure”, he warned.
The export-oriented industries in particular and import-substitute industries in general were confronting the greatest challenges which have never been witnessed in the history of Pakistan where the industrial and export productions have come to a standstill due to the unbearable cost of manufacturing, he added.
While claiming the closure of many industries in Karachi, he said not only gas but also the electricity price for the export sector has been increased by 115pc from Rs20 per KWh to Rs43.07 KWh and for general industries, electricity has been raised by 42pc from Rs30.39 per KWh to Rs43.07 KWh.
“Moreover, the hike in gas tariffs has also impacted the security deposits being submitted by industries to SSGC which have become unaffordable,” Iftikhar said.

5,Rupee gains 75 paise against US dollar,Bankers believe that the final IMF review will open the door for another bailout package from the institution.,"KARACHI: After overnight approval of a $700 million tranche by the IMF Executive Board, the rupee on Friday strengthened further appreciating by 75 paise against the US dollar in the interbank market.
The currency market was in high sentiments due to expected IMF approval and possible inflows from other sources. When the IMF approved the first tranche of $1.2 billion under the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in July 2023, the subsequent inflows from Saudi Arabia and UAE saved the country from sovereign default.
The State Bank of Pakistan reported the closing price of the dollar at Rs280.36 from Rs281.11 a day. The local currency has been gaining against the greenback but the appreciations were negligibly small. The 75 paise increase on Friday was considered the biggest jump in a month.
The inflow of $700m would boost the SBP forex reserves to $8.85bn, from $8.152bn in the week ended on Jan 5.
Bankers believe that the subsequent release of the remaining $1.1bn under the SBA after the final review in March would open the door for another bailout package from the IMF while the World Bank and Asian Development Bank would follow the track. 
In the last week of December 2023, the SBP received a cumulative $787m which improved its forex holdings to $8.2bn. These inflows were reportedly provided by the WB, ADB and other multilateral lending agencies.
The frequent depreciation of the dollar has compelled exporters not to hold their export proceeds while some currency experts believe that the PKR could reach the lowest level it achieved during FY23.

6,Stocks flat as political turmoil haunts investors,Analyst says that mid-session witnessed selling pressure on prevailing uncertainty over the outcome of the Senate resolution to postpone general elections.,"KARACHI: The IMF-driven rally proved shortlived as growing political tensions worried investors compelling them to take profits at elevated levels as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share trimmed early gains. However, it managed to stay in the green territory by the close of trading session on Friday.
Topline Securities Ltd said the equities began trading on a positive note and hit an intraday high of 739 points on the back of approval of the first economic review of Pakistan under the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement by the IMF’s Executive Board, which would lead to the release of $700m tranche.

Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said that mid-session witnessed selling pressure on prevailing uncertainty over the outcome of the Senate resolution to postpone general elections.
He said surging Pak­istan dollar bonds, rising global crude prices and strong rupee, however, helped the index to close in the green.
