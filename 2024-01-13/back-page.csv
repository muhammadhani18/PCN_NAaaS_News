• Backers of Palestine’s cause  march through The Hague, chant ‘Liar! Liar!’ at Israeli lawyers
THE HAGUE: Israel on Friday rejected claims brought by South Africa at the UN’s top court that its military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against Palestinians.  
Arguing it was acting to defend itself and was fighting Hamas, not the Palestinian population, Israel called on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to dismiss the case as “groundless” and reject South Africa’s request to order it to halt the offensive. “This is no genocide,” lawyer Malcolm Shaw said.  
South Africa told the court on Thursday that Israel’s aerial and ground offensive — which has laid waste to much of the enclave and killed almost 24,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities — aimed to bring about “the destruction of the population” of Gaza.  
Israel rejected the accusations, saying it respected international law and had a right to defend itself.  
“The appalling suffering of civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, is first and foremost the result of Hamas’ strategy,” the Israeli foreign ministry’s legal adviser, Tal Becker, told the court.  
“If there were acts of genocide, they have been perpetrated against Israel,” Becker said. “Hamas seeks genocide against Israel.”  
The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted in the wake of the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.

Humanitarian suffering 
Israel, its defence team argued, was doing what it could to alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Gaza, including efforts to urge Palestinians to evacuate. 
The court is expected to rule later this month on possible emergency measures — including South Africa’s request that it order Israel to halt its offensive.  
It will not rule at that time on the genocide accusations. Those proceedings could take years.  
The ICJ’s decisions are final and without appeal, but the court has no way to enforce them.  
Palestinian backers with flags marched through The Hague and watched proceedings on a giant screen in front of the Peace Palace. As the Israeli delegation spoke in court, they chanted: “Liar! Liar!”  
Asked what she thought of Israel’s arguments that the Gaza campaign was a matter of self-defence, Neen Haijjawi, a Palestinian who recently came to Netherlands, said: “How can an occupier that’s been oppressing people for 75 years say it’s self-defence?”  
Israeli supporters were holding a separate gathering of family members of prisoners taken by Hamas.  
Israel has said South Africa is acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist group by the United States, the European Union, Britain and several other nations. South Africa has rejected that accusation.  
Since Israeli forces started their offensive, nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes at least once, leading to a humanitarian catastrophe.  
Post-apartheid South Africa has long advocated the Palestinian cause, a relationship forged when the African National Congress’ struggle against white-minority rule was supported by Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation.  
“My grandfather always regarded the Palestinian struggle as the greatest moral issue of our time,” Mandla Mandela, a grandson of the late South African president Nelson Mandela, said at a rally in support of the Palestinians in Cape Town.

1,El Nino can make 2024 hotter than record-shattering 2023,"UN urges drastic emissions cuts to combat climate change; Guterres regrets humanity’s actions are ""scorching the Earth"".","• UN urges drastic emissions cuts to combat climate change
• Guterres regrets humanity’s actions are ‘scorching the Earth’
GENEVA: The year of 2024 could be hotter under El Nino’s influence than the record-shattering 2023, the United Nations warned on Friday, as it urged drastic emissions cuts to combat climate change.
The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said new monthly temperature records were set every month between June and December, and the pattern is likely to continue due to the warming El Nino weather phenomenon.
 






The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted there is a one in three chance that 2024 will be warmer than 2023 — and a 99 per cent certainty that 2024 will rank among the five warmest years ever.
The UN’s WMO weather and climate agency said July and August last year were the two hottest months ever recorded, as it officially confirmed 2023 had been the warmest year on record “by a huge margin”.
The WMO said the 2023 annual average global temperature was 1.45 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900).
The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and 1.5C if possible.
The WMO’s new secretary-general Celeste Saulo warned that El Nino, which emerged mid-2023, is likely to turn up the heat even further in 2024.
The naturally occurring climate pattern, typically associated with increased heat worldwide, usually increases global temperatures in the year after it develops.
“The shift from cooling La Nina to warming El Nino by the middle of 2023 is clearly reflected in the rise in temperature,” she said.
“Given that El Nino usually has the biggest impact on global temperatures after it peaks, 2024 could be even hotter.”
Humanity’s ‘biggest challenge’
NOAA said the 2023 global surface temperature was 1.18C above the 20th-century average, and was hotter than the next warmest year, 2016, by a record-setting margin of 0.15C.
 
 

The Arctic, northern North America, central Asia, the North Atlantic and the eastern tropical Pacific were particularly hotter, it said.
Saulo said climate change was now “the biggest challenge that humanity faces”.
A WMO report in November found that concentrations of the three main heat-trapping greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — reached record-high levels in 2022, with preliminary data indicating that the levels continued to grow in 2023.
“Climate change is escalating — and this is unequivocally because of human activities,” said Saulo.
“We cannot afford to wait any longer. We are already taking action but we have to do more and we have to do it quickly. We have to make drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources.”
‘Catastrophic future’ awaits
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said humanity’s actions were “scorching the Earth”. “2023 was a mere preview of the catastrophic future that awaits if we don’t act now,” he said.
 
 

The WMO said that since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one — while the warmest nine years on record had all been since 2015.
The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service issued its 2023 temperature findings on Tuesday, while NOAA and NASA released theirs simultaneously with the WMO on Friday.
The WMO consolidates figures from six major international datasets to provide an authoritative temperature assessment. It said the 10-year average temperature from 2014 to 2023 was 1.20C above the pre-industrial average.
Even if Earth’s average surface temperature breaches the 1.5C mark in 2024, it does not mean the world has failed to meet the Paris Agreement target of capping global warming under that threshold.
That would occur only after several successive years above the 1.5C benchmark, and even then the 2015 treaty allows for the possibility of reducing Earth’s temperature after a period of “overshoot”.

2,"Sudan war ‘catastrophe’ for 24m children, says Unicef","Since mid-April, Sudan has been gripped by war pitting army chief against his former deputy, paramilitary commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.","PORT SUDAN: The nine-month war between Sudan’s rival generals could create a “generational catastrophe” for the country’s 24 million children, Unicef’s representative in Sudan has said.
“The conflict in Sudan is severely putting at risk the health and wellbeing of Sudan’s 24 million children,” Mandeep O’Brien said in an interview with AFP late Thursday.
 






The fighting will not only have a serious impact on the future of Sudan, but will also “heavily (affect) the wider region”, O’Brien said.
Since mid-April, Sudan has been gripped by war pitting army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against his former deputy, paramilitary commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
 






The war has claimed at least 12,190 lives according to a conservative estimate by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project, and the United Nations says more than seven million people have been displaced.
They include 3.5 million children, according to O’Brien, leaving Sudan facing “the largest displacement crisis in the world”.

3,UN decries systematic blocking of aid to north Gaza hospitals,Says its convoys were subjected to slow and unpredictable inspections and then a near-systematic refusal from the Israeli side to proceed.,"GENEVA: Israel is consistently blocking humanitarian convoys into northern Gaza, making it increasingly difficult to bring desperately-needed fuel and other aid to hospitals there, the United Nations said on Friday.
After planning aid missions to the north, UN agencies said their convoys were subjected to slow and unpredictable inspections and then a near-systematic refusal from the Israeli side to proceed.
“Operations in the north (are) increasingly more complicated,” Andrea De Domenico, head of the UN aid agency OCHA’s office in the occupied Palestinian territories.
 






Speaking from Jerusalem to a virtual press briefing, he described how detailed coordination was required with a network of checkpoints, and “the Israelis have systematically, or quasi-systematically, refused” to let them through.
In recent days, he said, the agency had had three missions partially approved out of 21 requested.
Lucia Elmi, special representative for the UN children’s agency UNICEF in the Palestinian territories, also lamented that “we can’t get sufficient aid in”.
“The inspection process remains slow and unpredictable, and some of the materials we desperately need remain restricted, with no clear justification,” she said.
‘Inhumanity’
De Domenico said the Israeli military was particularly wary about allowing fuel into the north, especially to hospitals.
“They have been very systematic to not allow us to support hospitals, which is something that is reaching a point of a level of inhumanity that for me is beyond comprehension,” he said.
The UN’s World Health Organisation said it had finally on Thursday managed to reach Al Shifa hospital in the north for the first time in over two weeks, after seven failed attempts.
 






WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X that the mission allowed for the delivery of desperately-needed aid, including 9,300 litres of fuel.
He hailed “the team reported that Al Shifa, previously Gaza’s premier hospital, has (partially) re-established services”.
The hospital, which WHO described as “a death zone” after it largely ceased operations following attacks and occupation by Israeli troops in November, now has 60 medical staff, Tedros said.
It also has “a surgical and medical ward with 40 beds, an emergency department, four operating theatres, basic emergency obstetric and gynaecological services”.
Hospitals, protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in Gaza since the Hamas raid on Oct 7.
‘Disaster of epic proportions’
Only 15 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are even partially functioning, most of them in the south. The UN has long described desperate scenes in the few barely functioning hospitals remaining in the north, facing severe shortage of food, clean water, medicine and fuel.
While the partial resumption of services at Al Shifa was good news, Tedros emphasised that it meant “the consumption of fuel is much higher, and the need for medical supplies is increasing”.
Elmi, the Unicef representative, stressed the urgency of allowing more aid through, especially for Gaza’s children.
“Children in Gaza are running out of time, while most of the life-saving humanitarian aid they desperately need remains stranded between insufficient access corridors and protracted layers of inspections,” she said.
“Mounting needs and a constrained response is a formula for a disaster of epic proportions.”

4,"Myanmar junta, armed alliance reach ceasefire deal",Fighting has claimed hundreds of lives and displaced more than half a million people since October.,"YANGON: Myanmar’s military and an alliance of armed ethnic minority groups announced a China-mediated ceasefire on Friday following months of conflict that has posed the biggest threat to the junta since it seized power in 2021. 
Fighting has claimed hundreds of lives and displaced more than half a million people since October, when the alliance launched an offensive against the junta.
The alliance has seized several towns and border hubs in Myanmar’s northern Shan state that are vital for trade with China, a major arms supplier and ally of the military. 
“With the help of China’s facilitation, there was a meeting in (the southern Chinese city) Kunming. We have reached a ceasefire agreement,” junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said. 
Tar Bhone Kyaw of the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) — one member of the alliance — said they had “agreed to reopen border trade” with China. 
Beijing also announced the ceasefire on Friday, but no details of the areas it would cover or when it would come into force were given by any party. 
“The two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire, to disengage military personnel and resolve relevant disputes and demands through peaceful negotiations,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. 
The talks took place with the “mediation and facilitation of the Chinese side” on Wednesday and Thursday in the city of Kunming in Yunnan province, which borders Myanmar, she said. 
Scam towns 
China’s relationship with the junta has been strained in recent months over its failure to crack down on online scam operations that Beijing says target Chinese citizens. 
Since November people have been fleeing Laukkai town, located in a district bordering China, that was run by a Myanmar military-aligned militia and known for gambling, prostitution and online scams run out of compounds staffed by thousands of people, many trafficked. 
The alliance — made up of the TNLA, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Arakan Army (AA) — said last week the town was now under their control. 
Following reports last week that an artillery shell had exploded across Myanmar’s border with China, Beijing voiced “strong dissatisfaction” that fighting had caused Chinese casualties and said it would take “all necessary measures” to protect its citizens. 
Last month, Beijing said it had mediated talks between the Myanmar military and the allied ethnic armed groups and reached an agreement for a “temporary ceasefire”. 
But clashes continued in parts of Shan state, and China’s embassy asked its citizens to evacuate an area along the shared border owing to security risks. 
On Friday, spokesperson Mao said “both sides pledged not to compromise the safety of Chinese border residents and Chinese personnel in Myanmar”. 
“Maintaining the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks in Northern Myanmar is in line with the interests of all parties in Myanmar and also helps to maintain peace and stability at the border,” she said.

5,Opposing visions clash in Taiwan’s election as China looms large,"Beijing frames polls as choice between ""peace and war"", warns it would ""smash plots of independence"".","NEW TAIPEI: Hundreds of thousands of people attended final pre-election rallies in Taiwan on Friday ahead of critical presidential and parliamentary polls that China has warned could take the island closer to war.
Taiwan, a neighbouring island China claims as its own, is separated by a narrow 180-kilometre strait from China and is a major producer of vital semiconductors.
Vice President Lai Ching-te, the front-runner candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), paints the election as a choice between “democracy and autocracy” — criticising his main opponent Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang (KMT) for being too “pro-China”.
“After I get elected as the president, I will continue to take the path of democracy and peace. I will stand with the international camp of freedom and democracy. What’s more, I will forever stand with Taiwan’s people,” he said.

Beijing frames polls as choice between ‘peace and war’, warns it would ‘smash plots of independence’

In a stadium nearby, Mr Hou called for his red-and-blue-clad supporters to kick out the DPP, which has been in power for eight years. “This is a choice between war and peace… If Lai Ching-te is elected, the Taiwan Strait is very likely to fall into unrest,” said Hou.
 






“Don’t say that we are pro-China,” said supporter Minai at Hou’s final rally. “We just want the peaceful co-existence of both sides… I don’t want there to be a war.”
China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has framed the elections as a choice between “peace and war”, calling the DPP dangerous separatists and urging Taiwanese to make the “right choice”.
In the run-up to Saturday’s election, China repeatedly denounced Mr Lai and rebuffed repeated calls from him for talks.
China’s defence ministry, responding to a question earlier on Friday on Taiwan’s air force upgrading F-16 fighter jets and buying more from the United States, said even with purchases of US weapons the DPP “cannot stop the trend of complete reunification of the motherland”.
“The Chinese People’s Liberation Army remains on high alert at all times and will take all necessary measures to resolutely crush any form of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist plots and firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang.
Mr Lai says he is committed to preserving peace across the Taiwan Strait. The DPP has accused China of seeking to interfere in the vote by spreading disinformation and putting further military and economic pressure on the island. Beijing says election interference allegations are DPP “dirty tricks”.
‘US must not interfere’
Meanwhile, the White House said on Friday that the United States wanted to see free and fair elections in Taiwan and it would be unacceptable for any nation to interfere.
“It would be unacceptable for any other actor, nation, state or otherwise, to interfere with that exercise of democracy,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also met a senior Chinese official in Washington on the eve of Taiwan’s elections.
Blinken, briefly back in Washington in between his latest Middle East crisis tour and a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, opened talks with Liu Jianchao, who heads the international division of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee.
This “interference” by the United States was criticised by observers in Beijing.
