0,Imran challenges rejection of papers from NA-122 and 89,Khan's nomination papers from NA-122 were dismissed on the grounds of the him not being a voter of the constituency.,"LAHORE: Imprisoned PTI founding chairman Imran Khan on Friday filed two separate petitions in the Lahore High Court challenging the decisions of the returning officers (ROs) and the appellate tribunals of rejecting his nomination papers from NA-122, Lahore, and NA-89, Mianwali.
Initially, the registrar office did not entertain the petitions for not furnishing attested copies of the necessary documents. 
Later, the legal team of the former prime minister filed the petitions again after removing the objections.
A three-judge full bench headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi will hear the petitions on Saturday (today).
The petitions asked the high court to set aside the decisions of the returning officers and the appellate tribunals of rejecting the nomination papers from the both constituencies of the National Assembly.
Khan’s nomination papers were rejected primarily on the grounds of being convicted in the Toshakhana case. His nomination papers from NA-122 were also dismissed on the grounds of the proposer not being a voter of the constituency.
The appellate tribunals also upheld the decisions of the respective ROs with an observation that the conviction and sentence were two different terms as conviction pertained to the guilty verdict and sentence stands for the rigours following conviction.
The tribunals noted that the conviction meant a guilty verdict pronounced by a court in reference to the delinquency attributed to an accused, whereas the sentence denoted the quantum of punishment.
A tribunal observed that the decision of the ECP regarding disqualification of the petitioner was still in the field and had not been set aside from the competent forum.
On the point of the proposer not being the voter of the constituency, the tribunal said the revised delimitation report was issued by the ECP prior to the submission of nomination papers. It observed that nobody including the appellant and his proposer challenged the revised final delimitation report.
The observation of the RO that the appellant had not been proposed by a valid voter member of NA-122 as a contesting candidate from the constituency was a valid ground for rejection of his nomination papers, the tribunal held.
NAWAZ: A petition has been filed against the acceptance of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s nomination papers from NA-130, Lahore.
Pakistan Awami Mahaz chief Advocate Ishtiaq Ahmad Chaudhry filed the petition after the dismissal of his appeal by an appellate tribunal.
The petitioner pleaded that Mr Sharif was not eligible to contest the election due to a lifetime disqualification held by the Supreme Court for a person disqualified under article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
He said the former prime minister was disqualified by the apex court for being not righteous and sagacious (sadiq and ameen) under article 62(1)(f).
The petitioner asked the court to set aside the decisions of the RO and the appellate tribunal regarding acceptance of the nomination papers of the respondent from NA-130.
A full bench of the high court is likely to take up the petition on Saturday (today).

3,"Rejection of nomination papers: Verdicts reserved on pleas of Qureshi, Fawad, Sanam",LAHORE: A Lahore High Court (LHC) full bench on Friday reserved verdicts on the petitions of PTI Vice Chairman Shah...,"LAHORE: A Lahore High Court (LHC) full bench on Friday reserved verdicts on the petitions of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, party’s former leader Fawad Chaudhry and social media activist Sanam Javed against the rejection of their nomination papers for the Feb 8 elections.
During the hearing of Mr Qureshi’s petition, his counsel Abuzar Salman Niazi argued that all legal requirements were fulfilled to submit the nomination papers to contest election from NA-150, NA-151 and PP-218 of Multan.
He told the bench that Mr Qureshi was detained in Adiala Jail.
He argued that it was not necessary for a candidate to personally appear before the returning officer (RO) to submit his nomination papers. He said objections should not arise when the petitioner’s lawyer was present before the RO to verify his signatures.
The bench observed that the rules allowed the RO to seek personal appearance of a candidate for his satisfaction.
The counsel argued that to contest election was a fundamental right of every citizen, which could not be usurped through legal technicalities. He asked the bench to set aside the decisions of the ROs and an appellate tribunal and accept the nomination papers of the petitioner from all constituencies.
A lawyer for the election commission said the petitioner was a high-profile personality and was arrested for involvement in the May 9 riots. He said according to jail rules, permission was not granted without the authority’s approval. He said there was no record of the oath commissioner’s meeting with Mr Qureshi in jail, therefore, verification of the petitioner’s affidavit and signatures had not been done.
The bench, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, reserved its verdict on the petition.
Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan and Justice Jawad Hassan are other members of the bench.
The bench reserved verdict on a petition of Fawad Chaudhry against the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-60 and NA-61 of Jhelum.
The full bench also reserved its decision on the petition of Sanam Javed challenging rejection of her nomination papers from NA-119 and PP-150 of Lahore.

4,LDA defers proposal for U-turns on Canal Road,LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority’s (LDA) governing body has deferred a proposal seeking improvement in...,"LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority’s (LDA) governing body has deferred a proposal seeking improvement in traffic flow through construction of protected U-turns on Canal Road between Harbanspura and Jallo. 
Dawn learned the proposal was shelved due to some financial and technical issues.
The proposal says the stretch between Harbanspura and Jallo on Canal Road has witnessed rapid urban development with the establishment of numerous residential societies, educational institutions and recreational facilities. This road stretch has not been accommodated in terms of its traffic volume requirement to date. The surge in population and activity has inevitably led to increased traffic, necessitating a strategic approach to traffic improvement. 
“The provision of three protected U-turns along this route is proposed to address the growing need for the efficient and safe traffic flow. These U-turns would not only cater to the residents of burgeoning residential societies but also facilitate the smooth movement of students commuting to educational institutes and visitors accessing recreational facilities. By Implementing the proposed traffic improvement plan in this stretch will enhance overall traffic management, mitigating congestions and ensuring safety and convenience of the community,” the proposal maintains.
It further states that after conducting surveys, the cost estimate based on the MRS (market rates) first biannual 2023 and prevailing market rates amounting to Rs926.476 has been prepared which is chargeable to budget head -- Area Development Programme-New.
“In fact, this proposal has been deferred due to shortage of funds and some other technical issues. Hopefully, it will be approved in the next meeting of the LDAs governing body subject to availability of funds,” an official source said.

6,"PPP ‘surprises’ PML-Q, fields its candidates","PML-N aspirants, workers refuse to vote for ‘Q’","GUJRAT: The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has fielded its candidates against the scions of PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain in Gujrat as it announced tickets in eight constituencies out of a total 12 seats of the district on Friday. 
Mian Fakhar Mushtaq Pagganwala, the scion of former PPP MNA Mian Mushtaq Pagganwala (late), has been awarded PPP ticket for PP-31(Gujrat city) where Punjab PML-Q general secretary Chaudhry Shafay Hussain is a candidate. 
Similarly, Mubeen Arshad (a woman) and a young lawyer Azfar Badar Warraich (son of two times president of Gujrat district bar association Badar Warraich) have been awarded tickets against former federal minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain in NA-64 (Gujrat-Kunjah) and PP-32 (Kunjah), respectively. 
Earlier, the PML Q leadership would often claim that the PPP may not pitch its candidates against its nominees in Gujrat due to a cordial relationship between co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and PML-Q chief Shujaat Hussain. 

PML-N aspirants, workers refuse to vote for ‘Q’

However, the PPP issued tickets in all three constituencies of Gujrat where scions of Q chief are candidates. 
It is learnt that Mr Zardari made a phone call to Fakhar Pagganwala on Thursday, giving him a go-ahead to contest from Gujrat city’s PA seat as the local party workers have been asking the senior leadership to let Mr Pagganwala contest the elections. 
The party has also nominated Raja Idrees and Zaibun Nissa from PP 29 (Tanda-Karianwala) and PP 30 (Jalalpur Jattan) but no ticket issued in NA-63 (Jalalpur Jattan-Tanda) where PPP’s ex-MNA Nawabzada Ghazanfar Ali Gul is PML-N nominee against PML-Q’s Chaudhary Hussain Elahi. 
PPP stalwart Qamar Zaman Kaira and his cousin Nadeem Asghar Kaira have been issued tickets in NA-65 (Lalamusa-Dinga) and PP-33 (Lalamusa), respectively, and a former union council nazim Mian Khalid Rafique has been given party ticket in PP-34 (Dinga). 
The PPP could not launch any candidate for NA-62 (Sara-i-Alamgir-Kharian-Kotla) and PA seats PP-27 and 28.  Meanwhile, local PML-N cadres in three constituencies of Gujrat where the party did not field candidates under a seat adjustment with the PMLQ, have declined to vote for Q. 
A meeting of local party officials from NA-64 and PP-31 and 32, was held at the political office of former mayor of Gujrat Municipal Corporation Haji Nasir Mehmood on Friday. 
Ex-city MPA Imran Zafar, Aleemullah Warraich, an aspirant of PML-N ticket for NA-64, Mufeezullah Dar, former union council chairman, vice chairmen, councilors and other workers were also among the participants of the meeting. 
The participants lodged protest against party decision of not awarding tickets to its own aspirants and rejected the seat adjustment with the PML-Q. 
They said it was hard for them to stamp Q symbol tractor. 
The meeting also discussed the option of party ticket aspirants contesting as independent candidates from all three seats but the decision was left to Mr Mehmood who was asked to convey the workers concerns to the senior party leadership.

The development shocked many as Mehboob was the only DPO out of 36 districts who was shown the door just a few weeks before the election on Feb 8. 
An official said Mr Mehboob was transferred following frequent warnings issued by Faisalabad Regional Police Officer (RPO) Dr Abid Raja when complaints against him surfaced for supporting a man from the local powerful political elite.
He said the complaints were so frequent that the RPO issued four letters of advice to the DPO, directing him to be careful while dealing with the matters of the political elite. When the matter reached caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Inspector General of police Dr Usman Anwar, Mehboob was removed from his post. 
The official said when Mehboob came to know that his transfer matter was being discussed in power corridors, he immediately submitted an application to proceed for official leaves.  
When contacted, Malik Tariq Mehboob confirmed that the RPO had issued him the letters of advice but clarified that he was not alone as many other officers of the region had also been given similar warnings. He defended his position, saying he had served in the district by using his potential. 
Mehboob has been replaced by AIG Monitoring and Crime Analysis Muhammad Rashid as the new DPO of Jhang. 
The IGP also made transfer-posting of five other police officers, including Faisalabad SSP Operations Rizwan Ahmad Khan who was transferred and posted as AIG Admin & Security at Central Police Office (CPO) vice Sahibzada Bilal Omer. Mr Omer has been transferred and posted as AIG development at the CPO against an existing vacancy.
Similarly, awaiting posting Sohaib Ashraf has been posed as internal accountability branch vice SSP Abdulah Lak. Mr Lak has been transferred and posted as SP Headquarters Lahore vice Hassan Javed Bhatti, according to the notification issued here on Friday. 
The official said the Punjab government reshuffled the above-mentioned officers following the approval granted by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

10,Azad Theatre to stage Gargi’s play on Guru Nanak,"LAHORE: Keeping up Lahore’s tradition of coming up with good serious theratre, one of the leading parallel theatre...","LAHORE: Keeping up Lahore’s tradition of coming up with good serious theratre, one of the leading parallel theatre groups of the city – Azad Theatre – is gearing up for staging a play based on the life of Baba Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism and first of the 10 Sikh Gurus.  
Malik Aslam the moving spirit behind Azad Theatre tells Dawn that the play ‘Nanak Shah Faqir’ would be the first in Pakistan on Baba Guru Nanak’s life and teachings.
The play has originally been written by Balwant Gargi, a pre-Partition Indian playwright. 
In 2015, Gurbani Media made a film based on it, while it has been adapted for the local stage by Malik Aslam, who is also the director.
The premier of the play will be held at Alhamra Art Centre, The Mall, whereas a couple of other performances will be held at Kartarpur and Nankana Sahib, says Aslam.
He says rehearsals of the play were going on; though often frustrating, drama rehearsal is nevertheless a fascinating puzzle to try and solve. A bunch of performers diligently rehearsing the play at Azad Theater, hope it will be immensely liked by the audience. 
They say rehearsal part of a play has always been thrilling. They find the toil and hustle; artistes trying to put their best into their roles, and repeated readings of the script, marking for music space, body movements – all the stage ethics they practice-- exciting.
Aslam shared that Azad Theatre is also working on another new play, ‘Khali Kothi’ on the subject of illegal immigrants. The play has been written by Ahmed Umar and directed by Aslam himself. The play will be staged in Kharian and Mirpur along with Lahore.  
Established in 2011, Azad Theatre consists of a dynamic team with  over 22 years of experience of performances with a keen insight into  folk and modern theatre techniques. 
The team is considered amongst the  best in the field since all its members have attended a number of  national and international workshops over the years and has been trained  in international, as well as local theatre techniques.
