0,"LDA, town admin at odds over tax collection",The Maripur Town’s officials contend that they have exclusive jurisdiction to collect right of way charges,"Although the country is in dire need of taxes, a dispute has emerged between the Lyari Development Authority (LDA) and Maripur Town’s administration, regarding the collection of taxes, which is adversely impacting businesses based in the area. 
Recently, the administration of Maripur Town claimed that it has the jurisdiction to collect right of way charges from development agencies in the popular Hawke’s Bay area; and to this end attempted to collect right of way charges from many businesses operating in the area, including K-Electric. However, when LDA officials caught wind of the town administration’s plans, they fiercely opposed the town’s apparent jurisdiction to collect taxes, and initiated an advertisement campaign against the town administration. 
The advertisement campaign asserted that Hawke’s Bay Scheme 42 was entirely under the administrative control of the LDA and had nothing to do with Maripur Town; thus, only the LDA had the authority to collect charges for road cutting, material disposal, generator repair, and other tasks in Hawke’s Bay Scheme 42. 
In this regard, Executive Engineer, Javed Qamar, of DMC Keamari, informed the Express Tribune that the Deputy Commissioner Keamari had declared the 3 union councils of Hawke’s Bay: Moach, Gabo Pat, and Lal Bakhar, as a part of Keamari in 2021. “Therefore, LDA is illegally collecting charges within the limits of these 3 union councils,” asserted Qamar.

However, LDA’s Executive Engineer, Agha Nafees, disagrees. “The LDA is the only legal owner of the entirety of Hawke’s Bay; no other organisation has any jurisdiction over it. The Maripur Town administration had started collecting charges illegally from the establishments working here,” quipped Nafees. 
With the LDA and Maripur Town administration at loggerheads, businesses based in the area are confused as to whether they will end up paying tax to two separate bodies. Muhammad Rizwan, a person associated with the garment business in the area, told the Express Tribune that his company was already suffering due to the economic downturn, and therefore could not pay any more tax. “The authorities need to decide who will collect tax because there is no way businessmen in the area, including myself, will pay any more tax,” protested Rizwan. 
Agreeing with Rizwan, Muhammad Ramzan, a wood trader, said that businessmen had anticipated that the new local bodies would help them with their sewage, water, and energy issues, but instead of addressing such issues, the town administration was busy levying further taxes. Like Rizwan, Ramzan refused to pay any further taxes and suggested that the two bodies, the LDA and the town administration, sort out their differences without hurting the pockets of businessmen.

1,Key political figures exit city’s electoral arena,"Bilawal, Shehbaz decide against contesting from metropolitan city","A seismic shift has happened in the political landscape of the metropolis as the leaders of two major political parties have pulled out of the electoral battleground just before the 2024 general elections, triggering a lot of media speculation.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, whose party wants to see him in the Prime Minister House post-elections, has decided to not contest the upcoming election from any constituency of Karachi. The reasons for this decision have been left for the media to guess, but Bilawal had to face a defeat in the 2018 elections when he contested from a Lyari constituency.
Coincidentally, PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif, who initially set his sights on the Karachi's electoral field for the elections, has since withdrawn his nomination papers for the NA-242 constituency of Keamari. Sharif's decision aligns with his inability to secure victory in the constituency which comprises Baldia Town and its surrounding areas in the previous general elections.
This development raises questions about the perceived significance of Karachi, the commercial hub of the country, in the 2024 elections for the two major political parties.
Familial theme
Meanwhile in a unique electoral scenario, two real brothers have chosen divergent political paths, with one sibling contesting the upcoming election on a MQM-P ticket, while the other securing a PPP ticket for a Sindh Assembly constituency in Karachi. 
Iftikhar Qaimkhani, a former director general of the Sindh Building Control Authority, has been awarded a ticket by MQM-Pakistan for PS-109, while PPP has fielded his brother Zulfiqar Qaimkhani from PS-103.

Adding to the familial theme in the political fray, PTI has also awarded tickets to three brothers for National Assembly and Sindh Assembly seats. Former opposition leader in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Shaikh has been awarded a PTI ticket for NA-238, his brother Aleem Adil Shaikh is PTI's candidate from NA-232, and Naeem Adil Shaikh will be in the run from PS-123.
This electoral landscape showcases a distinctive dynamic with family members representing different political entities, creating an interesting intersection of familial ties and political affiliations.
Rift between PML-N & MQM-Pakistan
Disagreements have surfaced between PML-N and MQM-Pakistan regarding the NA-242 constituency of Karachi. Shehbaz Sharif withdrew his nomination papers, passing the party ticket to Khawaja Ghulam Shoaib, while MQM-Pakistan's Mustafa Kamal has jumped into the fray from this constituency.
PML-N's Rana Mashhood has reiterated his party's commitment to avoiding further strain with the MQM-P, saying that two parties, which have already reached a seat-adjustment agreement, would focus their competition in constituencies marked by unity rather than disarray.
Shehbaz Sharif, who withdrew from the Keamari battleground, will be contesting from Lahore and Kasur constituencies of Punjab. Khawaja Ghulam Shoaib of PML-N will face MQM-P’s in the NA-242 contest.

3,Cold snap triggers spike in sale of warm clothing,People hunt for slightly used items of famous international brands at used clothing markets,"The sale of new and used warm clothes has shot up in the Sukkur, Khairpur, Jaccababad, Shikarpur, Ghotki, Noushehroferoze and other districts of northern Sindh. 
All kinds of warm clothes like gloves, woollen hats, mufflers, pullovers, sweater-shirts and jackets are seen hanging in front of shops and stalls situated in different localities. 
Crowds of people can be seen bargaining with retailers in markets and weekly bazaars, besides woollies, heaps of quilts, bed covers, blankets and rugs are up for sale as well. 
Chilly weather especially at night for the last 15 days has forced the people to buy winter clothes and other necessary items in a sudden wave of cold in the city. Heaps of used quilts, blankets and rugs are also up for sale in the different markets of Sukkur. A visitor Bashir Ahmed said that an almost 25 per cent rise in prices has been observed in the prices of winter clothes compared to last year.

All kinds of clothing and accessories like gloves, woollen hats, mufflers, pullovers, sweatshirts, and jackets can be seen hanging in front of shops attracting people. But customers are becoming more and choosier while purchasing the used clothing.They not only select clothes which are best in quality but also try to get these at nominal rates,” Waseem Ahmed, a shop owner at a Mehran Markaz in Sukkur. 
Waseem said that people nowadays are aware of the value of international brands and pick up slightly used items of top clothing brands. The traders buy lots measured in weight and then sort men, women, children clothing. “Some buyers have an eye for the quality product in heaps of used dressing, they pick it like a hawk and haggle with the shopkeeper to extract a low price,” he explained. 
He said that some people even try to bargain at fixed-price shops. Many throng to various bazaars to find clothes that are both utilitarian and cheaper.
In Khairpur, the Lunda bazaars offer the poor cheap clothes,” remarked a middle-aged looking man at Station Road Khairpur. “The price of new winter clothing is out of our reach. Therefore, we rush to these second-hand cloth- stalls where we get quality clothes at affordable rates,” he added. 
New and expensive clothes were out of our reach due to financial constraints, though it was a difficult task to find suitable clothes for children so they opted to purchase used clothes, another buyer Zahra said. “Sometimes, we are lucky enough to find new and unused factory items,” she added
But many customers complained that second-hand clothes were also becoming expensive. “The prices of used clothes are spiralling every year,” commented a lady in a Lunda bazaar of Ghotki. 
However, Javed Ahmed, a used clothes dealer said that they were getting these clothes at exorbitant prices from wholesale dealers in Quetta and Karachi and were forced to sell them accordingly. APP

4,Sindh govt extends IBA executive director’s term by four years,"Interim setup accepts advocate general’s view, rejecting ECP recommendation","The Sindh government’s decision to extend Dr. Akbar Zaidi’s tenure as Executive Director of IBA Karachi by four years has ignited controversy due to legal and procedural irregularities. 
This development deviates from customary practice observed in Sindh’s government universities and examination boards department, where it has been lately seeking Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) approval for appointments and extensions.
Despite lacking a specific duration in the legal opinion from the Advocate General of Sindh, Chief Minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar decided to extend the term of the IBA executive director by four years, based on the legal opinion provided by the office of the Advocate General Sindh.
The ECP, in a letter dated January 5, initially permitted a three-month extension for Zaidi. However, on January 10, Sindh government received the legal opinion of Additional Advocate General Sindh Syed Muhammad Saulat Rizvi. He stated that there was no need to put the issue of extending the tenure of the IBA executive director before ECP, because it was not related to the election affairs and management. 
The letter also clarified that the employees and officers of IBA were not civil servants. Further, it has been said in the letter that the decision of the ECP of December 5, 2023 has been suspended by Sindh High Court (SHC), and the court’s order of December 29 will prevail over ECP’s ruling. 
It should be recalled that ECP on December 5, stopped the Sindh government from extending the tenure of Zaidi, after which Syed Nadeem Hussain filed a petition against ECP order in SHC. Consequently on December 29, SHC suspended the ECPs order restricting extension of IBA executive director till January 30, 2024.
Read IBA executive director granted 3-month extension
The evidence obtained from the Sindh Government’s Department of Universities and Boards and the Services, General Administration and Coordination Department (SGA&CD) indicates that the basis for the extension was a letter containing the legal opinion of the Advocate General of Sindh, as per the government’s request. 
However, this letter only suggests the extension of the tenure without specifying the duration. After receiving the Advocate General’s opinion, Baqar decided to extend the term by four years.
It should be noted that ECP had initially allowed a three-month extension, but the Sindh government sought the Advocate General’s opinion, arguing that the ECP’s decision did not apply to IBA employees who were not public servants.
The final opinion stated that there was no need to present the matter to ECP. The letter also cited that SHC has already ordered suspension of the ECP’s decision.
Despite the final opinion referencing a three-month extension, the Sindh government issued a notification for a four-year extension, departing from established practices and creating confusion. 
This move raises concerns about adherence to constitutional norms and the need for a consistent approach in all government universities and examination boards.
Attempts to seek clarification from the CM’s spokesperson Rashid Channa been met with silence, amplifying concerns over adherence to constitutional norms as the IBA Executive Director’s initial four-year term concludes on January 13, 2024.
