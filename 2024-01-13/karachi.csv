Awaited the entire year and thronged by youth mostly, the Eat Festival deserves to be explored for its offerings for people of other ages, too, because they were there, too, if one cared to see. There was something to tantalise all taste buds.
Seven-month old Zidane was being offered everything that his parents tried. “But he likes chocolates best,” his mother Ayesha told Dawn.
Senior citizen Rukhsana Barakzai, who was visiting from Quetta, said that she was looking for a steaming hot cup of tea. “I searched for plain tea, nothing fancy, for two hours until I reached this stall,” she said while comfortably seated before a counter inside a very green place with two big silver thermoses offering the desired hot beverage to her. “I am in Karachi here to visit my daughter, who is roaming about somewhere tasting different things. But I love my tea. When she remembers her mother she will know where to find me,” said the sweet lady smiling.
Another elderly lady, Nusrat Fasih, was found resting on a bench as she happily watched the other visitors around her. When asked why she was not eating anything, she smiled and said that she was feeling quite full after enjoying an Arabian paratha.
Two more ladies around her age, who also happened to be stall vendors, seemed to have dumped their responsibilities on the shoulders of their children, Shoaib and Arooba, before heading off to enjoy themselves.
Shoaib, son of Sumaiyya, was screaming at the top of his voice, trying to sell his mother’s Tikyani biryani and dal kachori while his wife Arooba, daughter of Nazneen, was minding the cash counter. Both said that their mothers had done their job by creating the unique dishes and left it to them to sell.
According to Shoaib, his mother and mother-in-law had created their own unique spices to come up with a tikka-flavour biryani, which they had named ‘Tikyani’ biryani. They even named their stall Tikyani.
Besides the food, it was also fun to read the creatively given names to the stalls. Another biryani stall was called ‘Jani Biryani’, a stall selling waffles was called ‘Wafflix’, a bakery was endearingly called ‘Dear Croissant’. A Chinese food stall was called ‘Pak-Shanghai Chinese Food’.

One might wonder why they didn’t name it ‘Pak-China Food’ instead. But who had the time to ask such things when all these places were only interested in conversations around sales. More interesting stall names included ‘De Calzone’, ‘75 Degree Hot’, ‘Yak Grill’, ‘Sweetistry’, etc.
The place didn’t have just food stalls. There were stalls selling imitation jewellery, chains, bracelets, earrings, fun accessories such as headbands that lit up in different colour lights, t-shirts and hoodies.
For those who like to take lots and lots of pictures to record their happy memories, there were plenty of photo booths along with various props and things to have their pictures taken against such as that yellow Vespa scooter, tonga, bus, etc.
Although the entrance ticket to the festival is Rs750 each, the visitors didn’t seem to mind much even after paying that initial amount and then paying more for all the food they bought. One visitor, Fatima Nazir, said that she has been a regular at the festival for the past two years and didn’t even remember what the entrance fee was last year or the year before that. “Who cares about the money when you are having so much fun,” she asked, munching on her mixed plate of cheesy potato fries and cheetos, which she wasn’t even sure how much she had paid for.
Although the simplest of food items such as a plate of biryani or khowsuey cost more than Rs400 or Rs700, there were also company stalls belonging to businesses such as Ahmed Foods, Youngs Foods, National Foods, etc., where the prices were kept quite reasonable, starting from Rs150.
But the best part of the Eat Festival is giving a break to not the big businesses but to new names and home chefs. One such young entrepreneur, Sania Bilal, co-owner of Cinnamon Rush, who introduced themselves to the city in last year’s Eat Festival, was found to be enjoying the festival with her friends like any other young visitor there.
When asked where her stall was located at the festival, Sania informed that she was taking a break this year from having a stall at the festival but she was selling her cinnamon rolls and coffee online now. “My older sister, Angela Bilal, with whom I had set up a stall here last year, is in London pursuing her Masters now. She has also been offered a job as the head baker of an eatery in London,” the youngster shared with Dawn.
This year, like it has done for new young chefs and eateries, the Eat Festival also used its platform to introduce budding musicians. There was a big stage at the far end of the stalls where they were proving their mettle by entertaining the crowds.

2,"Muttahida, ‘N’ poll deal suffers blow over NA-242",Shehbaz Sharif withdraws papers from Karachi constituency; MQM-P announces candidates on 19 of city’s 22 NA seats.,"• Shehbaz Sharif withdraws papers from Karachi constituency
• MQM-P announces candidates on 19 of city’s 22 NA seats          
ISLAMABAD / KARACHI: An ambitious seats adjustment deal between the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) does not work out as both sides have decided to field their respective candidates on all National Assembly seats in Sindh and Punjab for the Feb 8 general election, it emerged on Friday.
The break-up of the understanding came to the fore when, after long negotiations, both sides could not agree to finalise a unanimous candidate on a Karachi NA constituency (NA-242), from where PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif had filed nomination papers, but MQM-P’s senior deputy convener Mustafa Kamal was also adamant to contest the election from the same seat.
Finally, the younger Sharif withdrew his nomination papers from the NA-242 constituency on Friday.
Although, both sides have so far made no official announcement regarding their much talked-about political deal, sources in the two parties said it’s almost over. 
Many attempts were made to contact senior leadership of the MQM-P, but they were not available for comments. 
According to a list of candidates for NA seats issued by the MQM-P, Mr Kamal will contest polls from NA-242 (Keamari) against PML-N’s Khawaja Shoaib and others.
The Punjab chapter of the MQM-P on Thursday issued a list of its candidates for the NA and Punjab Assembly seats, fielding its candidates against top leaders of the PML-N.
According to the list, the party has issued tickets to its candidates for 26 NA and 11 PA seats.
Talking to Dawn, MQM-P leader Zahid Mehmood said the agreement between his party and PML-N could not work as the latter was not ready to accept his party’s demand. “The PML-N was not ready to give, but to take,” he added.
He said that when the PML-N had asked for NA-242 seat for Shehbaz Sharif, the MQM-P also wanted to get accommodated its candidate Kiran Ali from NA-119, a constituency from where Maryam Nawaz was contesting. 
He said as Maryam was already contesting from NA-120, the MQM-P had asked for NA-119 for its candidate, but their plea was turned down by the PML-N.
According to the list issued by MQM-P, Ms Kiran is still in the field from NA-119. 
Meanwhile, the MQM-P on Friday announced its candidates for Karachi’s 19 of the 22 NA seats and 39 of the total 47 PA seats.
The announcement came amid much speculation about cracks within its ranks.
Senior party leader Khawaj Izharul Hasan told a private news channel that there was a disagreement among senior leadership over distribution of party tickets and the situation had turned so serious that it led to an altercation during a meeting called to finalise names of candidates.
He claimed that ‘merit’ was ignored by the party leaders while selecting candidates for the Feb 8 elections. Later, the list issued by the party also contained his name as he was given a party ticket from NA-247.
According to the list, Dr Fouzia Hameed has been given ticket from NA-229, Aasia Ishaq from NA-232, Javed Hanif from NA-233, Amir Moin Pirzada from NA-234, Iqbal Mahsud from NA-235, Hassan Sabir from NA-236, Rauf Siddiqi from NA-237, Sadiq Iftikhar from NA-238, Arshad Vohra from NA-240, Dr Farooq Sattar from NA-241, Mustafa Kamal from NA-242, Humayun Usman Khan from NA-243, Dr Farooq Sattar from NA-244, Hafeezuddin from NA-245, Aminul Haq from NA-246, Khawaja Izhar from NA-247, Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui NA-248, Ahmed Saleem Siddiqui from NA-249 and Farhan Chishti has been given ticket from NA-250.

3,SHC disposes of petition after release of ‘missing’ lawyer,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday disposed of a petition after a ‘missing’ lawyer was set free by ...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday disposed of a petition after a ‘missing’ lawyer was set free by his captors and appeared in court.
A petition was filed in the SHC a couple of days ago, seeking recovery of Advocate Jauhar Abid, who is also contesting the upcoming general elections as an independent candidate, said to be backed by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London, from a National Assembly constituency (NA-248).
At the outset of the hearing, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that a case was registered at the Mobina Town police station and argued that the matter required urgent hearing since the missing lawyer was in wrongful confinement.
The SHO concerned was found absent and the SHC noted that liberty of a person was supreme. It directed the DIG (investigation) and SP-investigation concerned as well as a SP of the Counter Terrorism Department to appear in court after the tea break and file comments.
Thereafter, some police officials appeared before the SHC and Advocate Abid also turned up. He informed the court that he was set free. 
He, however, made it clear that he would not withdraw his candidature.
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto, disposed of the petition after the petitioner’s lawyer informed it that they were withdrawing the same.

4,"Twin babies, man die in fire at Ittehad Town home in Karachi",Police say house was illegally used to store polystyrene sheets; teenager dies in Lyari cylinder blast.,"KARACHI: Two infant children and a man died when a fire erupted in a house in Gulshan-i-Ghazi within the remit of the Ittehad Town police station on Friday.
Police and rescue officials said that the house was also used as a warehouse and thermocol sheets and other flammable material were illegally stored there.
Keamari SSP Arif Aslam Rao said that apparently a short circuit had caused the fire in the house located in Ihsan Mohalla, Gulshan-i-Ghazi.
Sharing details about the victims, Ittehad Town SHO Imtiaz Husain said infants Jawad and Abbas, who were twins, and a guest of the family, identified as 25-year-old Ali Nawaz, died in the fire.
The bodies were shifted to the Burns Centre of the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) for medico-legal formalities. Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that they died due to suffocation.

Police say house was illegally used to store polystyrene sheets; teenager dies in Lyari cylinder blast 

SSP Rao said that sheets of foam packed in aluminium foil were stored in the house, which belonged to a fisherman, due to which the fire spread rapidly and caused more damage.
A spokesperson for the Rescue-1122 said in a statement that the fire erupted at 2:59pm and it was controlled by fire tenders within 45 minutes. “The reason for the fire was thermocole and other flammable materials stocked in the house illegally,” the spokesperson added.

5,Kavad Katha — the art of storytelling,The show will continue till Sunday at Napa,"KARACHI: While discussing the past in relation to art, one is often reminded how T. S. Eliot has defined tradition in his remarkable essay Tradition and the Individual Talent. In a nutshell: he puts emphasis on the importance of the ‘historical sense’. This means: “The past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past.” But another important aspect of ‘the present directed by the past’ is looking back at one’s roots, simply because they provide the basis for our subsequent growth as a community. 
Directed by Rao Jamal Singh Rajput, Kavad Katha that premiered at the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) on Friday evening for a three-day run is also an attempt at revisiting one’s roots.
What kind of roots? Geographical? Spiritual? Physical? The answer is not as straightforward as one might think. Basically what Rajput has done is that he has taken an ancient Rajasthani form of storytelling — which used to travel to its adjoining areas in the old Rajputana region of India including that part which is now the province of Haryana — and employed Urdu, Sindhi and Haryanvi languages to tell the folk tales that are seldom told in our neck of the woods. One of the reasons for including Haryanvi is that both Rajasthani and Haryanvi dialects are a bit similar.
At the centre of it all, though, is the kavad katha, a three-dimensional form of narrating a story with a wooden plank that has doors painted with characters mentioned in the story. The doors are opened as the tale told by the kavadia (narrator) moves along; they’re accompanied by two musicians — sarangi and tabla players on Friday — on stage.  

The show will continue till Sunday at Napa

In the Napa production, Zubair Baloch uses Sindhi (Karonjhar Jo Qaidi), Hasnain Falak Urdu (Mirabai and Lord Krishna) and Rajput Haryanvi (Raja Amb and Rani Ambli) languages in their separate acts in a manner that can be categorised as lok dastangoi. After all, centuries back in the subcontinent, the oral form of kahani sunana was in vogue.  
Rajput’s effort as a director should be commended primarily because his sense of history and profound admiration for it is strong. However, at the end of the day, theatre is an art form whose success depends on actors’ effective communication with the audience. With a script in which tradition is the mainstay of the plot, your main task on stage is not to let the art get upstaged by the history. Both should be mutually reinforcing. In that context, Zubair Baloch’s performance among the three stands out. His voice projection gels with the mannerisms that he adopts for his act; and he seems to have a knack of knowing how to wait for the music to begin or end to enhance his presence as a kavadia. 
Well done.

6,Wahab inaugurates three-day Marigold Festival at Frere Hall,Says KMC will continue working with Sindh govt for city’s uplift,"KARACHI: Mayor Karachi Barrister Murtaza Wahab said on Friday that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) would continue to work together with the Sindh government for Karachi’s betterment.
He was speaking at the inauguration of the 4th Marigold Festival at Bagh-e-Jinnah (Frere Hall lawn) where asked the citizens to come in large numbers and tell the world that good work was also done in the city.
The mayor said that the revenue situation in KMC was also being improved as it had recovered Rs240 million from PSO, and the remaining Rs260m would also be recovered soon.
Mr Wahab said previously, the KMC’s income was just Rs580m but after his arrival, it had soared to more than Rs1billion during the same period.
He said Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was the only major political leader active in political field, and on February 8, everything would become clear as the citizens would decide who had worked and who had not. And after that, only the representatives of the Pakistan Peoples Party would be seen everywhere.

Says KMC will continue working with Sindh govt for city’s uplift

He congratulated the Parks Department for organising the three-day festival where, he said, more than 60,000 flowers had been planted for the citizens.
The mayor said that the Frere Garden was an asset of the citizens, adding that the entry of the citizens would be free.
He further said that the Sindh government had given three snorkels to the city yesterday which had been added to the fire brigade fleet and would be used all over the city to put off fires.

7,Afghan child killed over garbage collection in Karachi’s Surjani Town,Police waiting to lodge for family to file FIR against five-year-old Shehzad Gul's murder.,"KARACHI: An Afghan child was murdered in what police described as a dispute over garbage collection between two groups in Surjani Town on Friday.
The Surjani Town police said five-year-old Shehzad Gul was bludgeoned to death in Sector-4B.
They said the dispute erupted between two Afghans over the collection of garbage, which led to the murder. The suspect(s) had been identified and police were waiting for the family to lodge an FIR to formally initiate legal proceedings, the police added.
Victim’s father Gul Mohammed told reporters that he had been collecting garbage from houses for the last one month. On Friday, his son and a daughter accompanied him to collect the garbage, he said. 
During the work, he left his both children for a while and went to another street and when he returned, he learnt that his son had been injured by hitting with a hard and blunt instrument. 
He rushed the son to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH) where the doctors confirmed his death. 
The grief-stricken father said that he had been receiving ‘threats’ from a man who had got the contract of garbage collection prior to him. He suspected that his son was killed over that dispute.
“I am a poor labourer who earns Rs13,000 on a monthly basis through garbage collection,” said the father. Gul, a resident of Rozi Goth in Surjani, was the only brother of two sisters.

8,SHC restrains private school management from using residential place for their educational facility,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has restrained the management of a private school from using a house in Muhammad Ali...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has restrained the management of a private school from using a house in Muhammad Ali Society as their school.
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Agha Faisal granted the stay till the final disposal of a lawsuit filed last year essentially seeking to preclude a house from being used for any purpose other than residential and specifically seeking a restraining order for the same to be used as a school.
The bench in its order noted that the title documents of the property in question were available on record and there was absolutely no suggestion that the house was anything but residential.
“Nothing has been placed on record to accord any regulatory sanction for the house in question to be used for any purpose other than residential,” it added.
The bench noted that the 2002 regulations prescribed a specific methodology if a residential property was to be employed for educational purposes. 
“Admittedly, the house is not situated on a two hundred foot road and even otherwise no change of land use permission appears to have been accorded. Regulation 18-5 prescribes the entire procedure to be adopted for change of land use and there is no suggestion that the same has been availed or exhausted,” it added.
It also said regulation 25-2.2 contemplates the ratios for considering educational activity on residential plots and the minimum requirement expressed was a 50-foot-wide road for a primary school. 
“Notwithstanding that no permission for conversion has even been alleged before the court, the title document of the house demonstrates that it’s situated on a fifty foot road,” it observed. 
“As a consequence of the foregoing, this court has found no reason to disagree with the plaintiff’s contention that even a temporary sanction with respect to educational or commercial activity at the house would inter alia render the relevant law otiose,” it concluded.
1.28m students have no desks in govt schools, SHC told
The education authorities on Thursday informed the SHC that out of four million students enrolled in the government-run schools in Sindh, 1.28m kids were studying without desks and furniture.
The SHC deplored that in the 21st century, the government had failed to provide desks, buildings and other facilities despite availability of billions of rupees in the annual budget.
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar noted that hundreds of students were also getting education under the open sky, temporary huts or tents due to heavy floods in recent years.
It directed the education and literacy department to ensure procurement of desks preferably within a period of six months by completing all codal and legal formalities as per specifications issued by the department.
The bench also ordered the finance department to release the budget on a war footing basis.
When the bench took up for hearing a lawsuit, filed last year against the award of a contract to procure furniture/desks for government schools, the education secretary in a report submitted that desks were needed for 1,280,000 students enrolled in government schools all over the province and they were taking all-out measures for procurement of the desks while keeping in view the space available in such schools. 
“This situation brought on record is very alarming and in the era of 21st century, Government has failed to provide desks and teachers as per students’ ratio policy as well buildings, laboratories, digital education and transportation despite availability of billions of rupees in yearly budget,” it added. 
At the last hearing, the SHC had ordered a judicial officer and others for inspection of desks provided in government schools in Mirpurkhas region.
The judicial magistrate in the report said that inspection of 2,400 desks, provided in Umerkot district, was carried out and wooden parts of desks were not polished, but coloured while major quantity of desks was not having proper standing feet to well manage the balance of the desks.
The SHC noted a perusal of the report categorically reflected that desks provided in Umerkot were against specifications and confronted the contractor who assured the court that he was ready to replace all such desks within six months as per specifications. 
The contractor further undertook that he will provide rest of 9,400 desks within two months strictly in accordance with the specification. However, the bench said that already supplied desks available in schools must not be removed until replaced desks with specifications were provided.
The SHC also directed the secretary to constitute a committee with a mandate to check and verify all desks provided in all district including desks supplied by plaintiff and defendants and determine whether or not they are in accordance with the specifications.

11,"Over 4,400 polling stations in Sindh ‘highly sensitive’, IGP tells media","Says department runs short of 10,000 personnel to ensure proper security during polling","DADU: Inspector General of Sindh Police Riffat Mukhtar Raja has said that of 19,236 polling stations across the province 4,407 are ‘highly sensitive’, 5,600 are ‘sensitive’ and 6,000 are deemed ‘normal’.  
He said that eight police officials each would be posted at the ‘highly sensitive’ polling stations and six each at the ‘sensitive’ ones. The Ministry of Interior and the Election Commission of Pakistan had been informed about the estimated number of police personnel required for election duties and if the number of ‘sensitive’ polling stations rose, so would the law-enforcers, he said.  
The IGP was talking to journalists after inaugurating the All-Pakistan Tariq Baloch T20 Tournament at Kotri SITE cricket ground late on Thursday night. 
He said that no such incident had occurred so far, which might threaten law and order conditions and cause change in the status of polling stations. 

Says department runs short of 10,000 personnel to ensure proper security during polling 

He said that it was the responsibility of the ECP to conduct elections and “we’ll be there only to provide security to the process”. A total of 150,000 police personnel were to be deployed but “we have a shortage of 10,000 men”, he said.  
He said that police were combating terrorists and preempting their activities in Sindh in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies. Sindh’s rugged mountainous area was difficult to police due to harsh weather conditions and unfriendly terrain, while riverine area remained under water for four to six months which made the land swampy when it receded, he said.  
He said that bandits were well aware of the changing conditions of the land and were used to weather conditions in the riverine area but police found it difficult to operate in there. The area needed to have roads and bridges so that it did not remain a no-go area, he said.  
The IGP said that effective measures were being taken to prevent incidents of kidnapping. No ‘Safe City’ project had been completed in any city of the province and even in a metropolis like Karachi, work on the Safe City remained unfinished, he said, urging civil society to play its role in this regard. There were also some technical issues hampering the project, he said.  
He said that it was the most difficult task to set up an industry in Pakistan and appreciated industrialists for providing jobs to thousands of people.   
He advised industrialists to prepare a report about the police personnel required for maintaining law and order in industrial zone in Jamshoro, number of check-posts and police stations and he would try to have the report approved by the upcoming elected government.  
He said that new recruitment of police across the province would help end shortage of law-enforcers and personnel of special security unit too would be sent back to their districts.  
He said that changes were being made in traffic system in Sindh under which the job of challanning vehicles and e-ticketing could be outsourced. “This is the first time I have visited a chamber in Sindh and am so happy to meet industrialists,” he said. 
Later, the IGP went to the office of Jamshoro Chamber of Commerce and Industry where he met manufacturers and traders, listened to their problems and issued orders to resolve them.  
The industrialists presented Sindhi caps and gifts to the IGP, Hyderabad Range DIG Tariq Razzak Dharijo, Jamshoro SSP Muhammad Tariq Nawaz and Hyderabad SSP Amjad Ahmed Sheikh.

13,Second dolphin found dead within three days,SUKKUR: A second dead dolphin was found within the last three days in this district apparently due to shallow waters...,"SUKKUR: A second dead dolphin was found within the last three days in this district apparently due to shallow waters in the Indus River which is forcing the rare species to rush towards offtaking canals to find deep water so as to escape death. 
On Friday, a blind Indus dolphin — a species facing extinction — was found dead in the Bago-Jango section of a canal flowing in the Pannu Aqil taluka. 
Some villagers spotted the carcass and informed the local irrigation officials, who proceeded to the specified spot, close to the old Rohri SSP office, and took it into their custody. Only on Wednesday, a dolphin was found dead in similar circumstances in another canal flowing through Rohri taluka. 
Locals and irrigation officials told the media that flows in Indus between Guddu and Sukkur barrages were stopped on January 1 for 20 days for annual cleaning. 
On account of the process, water level in the Indus had come down forcing marine population, including dolphins, to swim away into different canals in search of deep water. They said that it was a general phenomenon during the water closure period. 
As a fallout of the water closure, seven canals offtaking from Sukkur Barrage are gradually getting dry to facilitate their cleaning.
The officials say that once dolphins leave the river and swim far away from it in some canal, there is little possibility of their return into the Indus. 
However, if information about their presence in a canal is conveyed to the officials concerned timely, they can be rescued. Dolphins can survive in shallow water only for about six-seven hours.

Sources in police said that police sought help from influential persons to identify and ‘convince’ the bandits, who had robbed the policemen, Mumtaz Mahar and Arshad Jarwar, of their Kalashnikov rifles, and also picked up their relatives to pile pressure on them to return the official weapons. 
The sources said that Mirpurkhas SSP Aadil Memon and DSP 
Fazal Haq Chandio ar-rived at Sindhri police station and prepared strategy for recovering the official weapons 
and arresting the robbers. 
They formed special teams which cordoned off the area where the crime had taken place and started checking vehicles and motorcycles. They also detained several relatives of the robbers to pressurize them to surrender to police and return the arms weapons, said the sources. 
They said the SSP directed police teams to contact influential personalities of the area and general public to seek their help to track down the culprits.
On Friday, police received a tip-off about the culprits’ presence near Tori Mori on Peromal Road in the limits of Sanghar district and carried out raid on the place where they found the official weapons hidden underground while the culprits had managed to escape before the raid, said the sources.
They said that police teams were combing Sanghar district for the culprits and were hopeful of laying hands on them soon.
Earlier, the SSP had suspended the two policemen on charges of inefficiency while SHO of Sindhri police station lodged a case against the dacoits identified as Ghulam Rasool aka Makhan Shar, Meran Shar and two unknown outlaws.
