2,Plea filed against Nawaz chairing meetings,PML-N leader holds seat in National Assembly,"A petitioner has requested the Lahore High Court (LHC) to prohibit former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from presiding over administrative meetings and issuing directives to cabinet members and state officials despite holding no official position in either the provincial or federal government.
The petitioner, Mushkoor Hussain, argued that Nawaz Sharif, the supreme leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), has recently chaired three administrative meetings of the Punjab government.
He contended that the move, coming after his prolonged absence from public view since the general elections, had raised significant concerns.
On March 18, the three-time former premier chaired administrative meetings of the Punjab government alongside his daughter, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
During the sessions, directives were issued concerning various infrastructure projects, including the underground train and metro bus, as well as initiatives addressing farmers' issues, provision of electric bikes for students and the Ramazan relief package.
The petitioner argued that Nawaz Sharif's involvement in the meetings raised constitutional questions, considering his lack of any official position in the government at either the provincial or federal level.
He stated that it was widely perceived that the leader holds significant sway over major decisions, even though he only holds a seat in the National Assembly.
He cited the chief minister’s remarks when asked why Nawaz Sharif's image adorns the bags used to distribute ration under the Ramazan package. The response was, ""Because it is Nawaz Sharif’s government.""
The petition contended that Nawaz Sharif's participation in the meetings and issuance of directives is unlawful and unconstitutional, violating both the Punjab Government Rules of Business 2011 and the principles of democracy enshrined in the constitution.

4,OCU to pursue Ichhra inciters,"Suspects to be traced through videos, geo-fencing","The investigations of an incident of endangering the life of a woman in Ichhra Bazaar over objections regarding her dress design have been transferred to the Organised Crime Unit (OCU) of the police.
Since a mob was involved in the incident that took place on February 24, initial investigations have suggested the involvement of 321 unidentified people and seven nominated persons in the case.
According to officials, the police have collected 34 video clips of the incident from various sources. The investigations will also involve geo-fencing to confirm the presence of the suspects at the scene. It is going to be a hectic job as thousands of phone numbers active at the time of the incident are to be analysed.
Since it has turned into a huge case that may involve dozens of raids, screening of evidence and manhunt, the Kahna OCU will investigate the matter further and arrest the rest of the suspects.
Three of the suspects were arrested by joint teams of the police operations and investigations wings.
The officials said the police had started the process of marking the suspects using video clips and other evidence and sending them to the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) for identification.
After identification of the suspects through photometric analysis, the police will also try to establish their presence at the scene with geo-fencing to present it as evidence.
The arrested suspects were identified as Nadeem, Adil Ali and Altamash.
They had allegedly harassed the woman and tried to take her life by inciting the mob to violence.
The arrested men had gone into hiding after the incident and switched off their mobile phones.
They were traced through an intelligence-based operation.
Ichhra police had lodged the First Information Report (FIR) against dozens of miscreants who harassed the woman wearing a shirt with Arabic-script print.
The suspects turning into a charged mob had accused the woman of “blasphemy”, endangering her life, as was evident from mobile phone footage of the incident, which was also highlighted by international media.
However, timely action by the police was also lauded when the video clips showed Gulberg ASP Syeda Sheharbano Naqvi confronting the mob and rescuing the woman.
While the ASP was duly appreciated for showing courage and risking her own life to save the woman, some other officers also played an important part by engaging the charged mob for an hour and making the rescue operation successful.
The sources said Ichhra SHO Mohammad Bilal Arbi and Model Town SP Operations Irtaza Komail were the first to reach the spot and facilitate the woman’s rescue when the mob chanting slogans was advancing towards her.
Following an emergency call, a patrolling officer, ASI Sajid, had rushed to the scene where the mob had besieged a shop wherein the woman had taken shelter, fearing lynching.
The SHO had also reached the spot at around 1:30pm and immediately put the police personnel on high alert.
According to media reports, he had spotted a man carrying a loaded weapon trying to reach the woman. The SHO and his team overpowered the suspect, disarmed him and unloaded the weapon.
The police personnel led by the SHO formed a multi-layered shield between the mob and the woman. SHO Bilal Arbi then informed the SP concerned of the situation, who reached the spot along with additional force.

6,CM wants IT towers ready in a year,She ordered the completion of both towers of the IT city in a year.,"The provincial cabinet has approved the handover of the Lahore Knowledge Park to Punjab Central Business District Development Authority to build the country’s first IT city.
“Tech giants like Google and Microsoft have already shown their interest in the IT city,” Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said while presiding over the cabinet meeting.
She ordered the completion of both towers of the IT city in a year.
“The world's major educational institutions will be invited to build campuses in the Knowledge City, she said and added, “There will be a Film City too.”
The cabinet also approved a project for the supply of 20,000 petrol and electric bikes by the Bank of Punjab. 
The chief minister said, “Electric bikes are essential to reduce environmental pollution but are currently not that much viable due to the risk of battery theft and low mileage. Therefore, the down payment will be reduced to Rs25,000 and the monthly installment will be less than Rs5,000.”
The distribution of the bikes will begin in May. 
“A separate scheme will be introduced to give bikes to students who have achieved significant success in examinations,” the chief minister said.
As per court directions, the cabinet approved the trial of the PTI founder and former minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in Adiala Jail. 
The cabinet also gave in-principle approval for the extension of the posting on deputation of the Punjab Transport Company CEO. 
It approved the provincial representation in the Council of Common Interests Secretariat. An approval for the transfer of the Punjab government’s Grade 19 vacancy in the secretariat was also granted. 
During a discussion on the Punjab Air Ambulance Project, the chief minister said, “All facilities are available for the rich and influential people, but nothing to save the life of a poor man. We want to provide every facility of timely treatment to our people.” 
She said it was unfortunate that Sargodha did not have adequate facilities for the treatment and transfer of heart attack patients. 
“Sitting in offices, it seems that the air ambulance is not needed, but it is needed because Rescue 1122 received 1,100 calls for air ambulance in emergencies,” she asserted.
“In the Lahore PIC Emergency Department, heart attack patients arrive from distant areas in eight hours. Therefore, the air ambulance project is very much needed, but it will be rolled out on a trial basis in the first phase,” she said.
The chief minister said,” We should feel pain for the poor. How sad it was that sanitary workers lost their lives in Faisalabad due to lack of safety kits.” 
The cabinet gave approval in principle to reduce the number of law officers in the province to 66 after following strict performance-based criteria. 
The chief minister said, “I have not recommended anyone. Corruption, political affiliation and incompetence will not be tolerated in the government service.” 
The cabinet also ratified the approval of the annual budget and supplementary budget grant for 2023-24.
