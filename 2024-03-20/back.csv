4,Police arrest main accused of Ichhra incident,"The suspects are identified as Nadeem Commando, Adil Ali and Altamash."," 
In a major breakthrough, the Lahore police on Tuesday apprehended the accused involved in the Ichhra Bazaar incident that occurred on February 24.
The suspects are identified as Nadeem Commando, Adil Ali and Altamash.
The accused had harassed the woman and tried to take her life and incited the mob to violence. They went into hiding after the incident and switched off their mobile phones.
The suspects were traced by a joint team of operations and investigation wings through an intelligence-based operation.
The Lahore police maintained that protecting the lives of people was their topmost priority, adding that no one was above the law.
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) granted pre-arrest interim bail until March 25 to an accused, Maulana Aleemud Din Shakir, in the Ichhra Bazaar incident case.
The court ordered the accused to furnish surety bonds of Rs 100,000 to avail the relief of bail. ATC Judge Arshad Javed heard the bail petition filed by Maulana Aleemud Din Shakir, who appeared alongside his counsel during the proceedings.

The petitioner’s counsel argued before the court that his client stopped the mob from torture, and the police also appreciated his role. However, despite this, his client was nominated in the case, he submitted, requesting the court to grant interim bail to his client.
The court also granted interim bail until March 25 to another accused, Khalid Shahenshah, in the same case, and ordered him to furnish surety bonds of Rs 100,000 for the purpose.
The Lahore police had lodged the First Information Report (FIR) against dozens of miscreants who harassed the woman wearing a shirt with Arabic-script print a couple of days back in Ichhra Bazaar.
The suspects turning into a charged mob had accused the woman of “blasphemy” as they confused the Arabic alphabet and words with the Quranic verses, endangering her life, as was evident from some mobile phone footage of the incident, which was also highlighted by international media, bringing disgrace to the country.
However, timely action by the police was also lauded in and outside Pakistan when the video clips showed the heroic role of a woman police officer, Gulberg circle ASP Syeda Sheharbano Naqvi, who confronted the mob and rescued the woman.
Athough ASP Naqvi was duly appreciated for showing courage and risking her own life to save the woman, the police high-ups had ignored the role of some other officers who played an important part by engaging the charged mob for an hour, making the rescue operation successful.
In this regard the role of Ichhra SHO Mohammad Bilal Aarbi and Model Town SP Operations Irtaza Komail were also lauded as they were the first to reach the spot and facilitated the woman’s rescue when the mob was advancing towards her, chanting religious slogans.
Following the emergency call, police said, patrolling officer ASI Sajid had rushed to the scene where the mob had besieged a shop wherein the woman had taken shelter fearing lynching.
Meanwhile, the SHO Bilal also reached there at around 1:30pm and immediately put the police personnel on high alert.
According to media reports, the SHO spotted a man carrying a loaded weapon and trying to reach the woman. However, the SHO and his team immediately overpowered the suspect, disarmed him and then unloaded the weapon.
The police personnel led by the SHO formed a multi-layered shield between the mob and the woman as was shown in some mobile phone footage of the incident. Bilal then informed the SP concerned of the situation, who also reached the spot along with additional force.
Meanwhile, ASP Naqvi reached there and daringly rescued the woman from the mob.

6,"What was the hurry, wonders IHC","Bench questions hasty trial in cipher against Imran, Qureshi"," 
Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked on Tuesday that the cipher case against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and senior leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi was neither a hard-core criminal case nor a white-collar crime, rather it was a unique hybrid-type case.
Heading a two-judge bench, including Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, to hear appeals against the conviction of Imran and Qureshi, the chief justice also said that the Constitution guaranteed the right to a fair trial but not allowing cross-examination of witnesses ended that right.
Barrister Salman Safdar, the counsel for the appellants, appeared in the court. He told the bench that the interior secretary had applied for registering of the cipher case with the approval of the federal government but the complaint did not contain the names of Imran or Qureshi.
“All the cases that have been constituted against the PTI founder are out-of-the-box. The decisions in Toshakhana, cipher and marriage during Iddat period cases have also been given in the same way, the lawyer told the court.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq observed this was not a hard-core criminal case, adding that it was not even a white-collar crime, rather it was a “unique hybrid-type” case that would set a new judicial precedence. However, Barrister Safdar stated that this was a case of crime against the state.
The chief justice also raised the question about a hasty trial. According to the Article 10-A of the Constitution, he said, it was necessary to fulfil the requirements of a fair trial. He added that if the right to cross-examination was quashed, that right was also lost.
Barrister Safdar said that the trial judge wrote in the judgment that he decided the case quickly on high court’s direction, although the Supreme Court had quashed the high court’s direction for completing the trial within a month.
The chief justice remarked that there was no bar on conducting daily hearing of the case but there must be some logical reasoning for that. He further remarked that the court would also ask about the status of the trial in the evening, questioning why the hearing continued even till 10 O’clock in night.
Barrister Safdar said that on January 24, four witnesses were cross-examined till evening. On January 25, the lawyer for the PTI founder sought adjournment due to illness. The lawyer could not appear before the court on one day, and the next day the trial judge appointed government lawyers.
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb asked about the standing of those appointed lawyers. The chief justice remarked that the court would listen to the advocate general on the matter. Justice Aurangzeb asked Barrister Safdar as to why the trial was rushed. The lawyer replied: “Perhaps the judge had to meet a deadline.”
Barrister Safdar sought to draw attention of this court, saying that even today this was still happening in Adiala Jail, where Imran was facing some other cases. Later, the court adjourned the hearing of the appeals till Wednesday (today).

7,Impasse over NA Opposition leader continues,Ruling alliance not accepting SIC as parliamentary party,"The stalemate over who will become the opposition leader in the National Assembly continued on Wednesday between both sides of the aisle.
Two weeks have passed since the formation of the new government but the process of appointing the opposition leader in the NA could not be completed.
The delay in the appointment of the opposition leader by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has raised many questions.
According to sources, more than 85 MNAs presented signed documents to the speaker nominating PTI-backed independent member Omar Ayub Khan as the opposition leader.
The nomination was formally presented to the office of the NA speaker.
Malik Amir Dogar presented the documents of Ayub’s nomination to the NA speaker.
Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza, MNAs Ali Mohammad Khan, Riaz Fatyana, and Dr Nisar Ahmad Jatt among other opposition members were also present on the occasion.
The realisation that the formal process of appointing a leader of the opposition had not been completed struck the PTI-SIC coalition during the NA session earlier this month.
Also read: Omar Ayub nominated for NA opposition leader
It occurred when former NA speaker Asad Qaiser urged the current one to give the floor to the leader of the opposition.
Sadiq, in response, questioned who had declared Ayub as the opposition leader.
The speaker guided the PTI-SIC lawmakers, stating that they needed to follow the formal process, and only then would Ayub officially become the opposition leader.
It is a parliamentary tradition that whenever the leader of the opposition rises to speak, they receive the floor to express their views.
However, the ruling alliance is refusing to accept the SIC as a parliamentary party. The vast presence of PTI-backed independent members has created difficulties in the appointment of the opposition leader.
The sources said because of the lack of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, a deadlock had arisen in the formation of important parliamentary committees.
They added that the formation of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as well as special and standing bodies of the House would be decided after the appointment of the NA opposition leader.
For now, the formation of these essential parliamentary bodies, including that on Kashmir, has hit a snag in the absence of an NA opposition leader.
The PAC is usually headed by the opposition leader but PTI’s Sher Afzal Marwat recently maintained that he had been nominated by party’s founding chairman Imran Khan for this slot.

8,Imran sees govt ending in six months,Says PTI not involved in anti-martyrs smear campaign; warns IMF money will be wasted without political stability,"PTI founder Imran Khan has denied party’s involvement in social media rhetoric against army martyrs.
During an informal exchange with journalists at the £190 million reference hearing in Adiala Jail, Imran Khan emphasized that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was not engaged in any derogatory discourse on social media targeting the army martyrs.
He alleged that individuals behind the theft of CCTV footage from the May 9 tragedy were attempting to sow discord between PTI and the military.
Imran also claimed that the current government would last only five or six months and until then, he would stay in jail and awaited the departure of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo to London.
“PTI is not involved in the rhetoric against the martyrs of Pakistan Army on social media. This army is ours, why should we be against it,” he said. “The same people who stole the CCTV footage of the May 9 tragedy are involved. They will try to create a rift between the army and the PTI through social media.”
He said that the martyrdom of Lt-Gen Sarfaraz Ali in the helicopter crash in 2022 had saddened him and it caused an irreparable loss to the army. “No tweet was made against the martyrs of the army from any of our official accounts,” he insisted.
Accusing certain quarters of orchestrating the May 9 attacks to portray PTI as traitorous, Imran criticized the politicization of matters by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military's media wing.
He argued that ISPR's comments regarding a specific political party’s involvement in social media campaigns should have been preceded by consultation with PTI.
“The ISPR should ask us first in this regard.”
Imran Khan reiterated his skepticism regarding the longevity of the current government, predicting its demise within five or six months. He cautioned against the potential repercussions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, foreseeing a surge in inflation rather than stability.
He alleged collusion among the caretaker government, the Election Commission, and the establishment. He asserted that the election, built on deception, had laid bare systemic flaws. Imran pointed to widespread calls for the resignation of the chief election commissioner (CEC) as a testament to the prevailing discontent.
Regarding the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Imran noted their reluctance to participate in the cabinet despite being part of the coalition. He suggested that the PPP's hesitation stemmed from a lack of confidence in the current governance structure's viability. “They know that this setup will not work”.
Imran underscored the importance of political stability in the country, otherwise, he warned that the money borrowed from the IMF would go waste. “I told the IMF not to issue loans until there is political stability in the country,” he said.
“There is no point in borrowing from the IMF unless we increase our sources of income,” he said. “The biggest problem in our economy is the shortage of dollars. We have the key to bring dollars into the country,” he added, in response to another query.

“It is possible through overseas Pakistanis,” Imran said, while explaining how the country’s economic issues could be mitigated.
“Only overseas Pakistanis can get us out of the current situation [but] the Overseas Pakistanis will only invest [in the country] when there is a stable government,” he added.
Imran was also asked about the Pakistani strike against militant targets inside Afghanistan. He said that it benefited the enemies of the country. “There should have been good relations with whatever government is in Afghanistan. Deterioration of relations with Afghanistan will increase terrorism.”
He recalled that the previous PTI government held the dialogue between the Taliban and the United States. “During our time, the Afghan government had assured us of resolving the TTP [Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan] problem and the terrorism would [have] ended forever,” he said.
The former prime minister claimed that he had told the then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa not to change then Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general Faiz Hameed, because Gen Faiz could resolve the problem of terrorism.
He alleged that later, Gen [now retired] Bajwa used to say in the Corps Commanders Conference that Imran Khan wanted to make Lt-Gen [now retired] Faiz the army chief. “The thought of making Faiz Hameed as the army chief never crossed my mind,” he added.
“Gen Faiz, who conducted dialogue between Afghanistan and the US was removed at the request of the Sharifs. By removing Gen Faiz, Bajwa thought of personal benefits and not of the country’s interest. And through the regime change, I was stabbed in my back,” he said.
Imran also alleged that the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government, which replaced his PTI-led dispensation after a no-confidence motion in April 2022, did not pay any attention to Afghanistan. “Bad relations with Iran and Afghanistan are a foreign policy failure.”
About a meeting of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif earlier this month, Imran stressed that Gandapur met the prime minister to get the province’s money due against the Centre. “Gandapur has to run the province and he needs money,” Imran said.
When asked why he said that Gandapur should not have taken the picture with the prime minister, he said that the photograph should have been taken after receiving the money from Centre. However, he was sceptical about the release of the provincial funds.
About his court cases, Imran said that he would stay in jail for five or six more months after which the government would end. He claimed that he was given punishments in three cases in one week to crush the PTI but this “plan has failed”.
About the proceedings in the £190 million case, he said the money had come to Pakistan from Britain, therefore, it was necessary to keep the matter confidential. He added that it was unique case because there was no theft, the money was with the government, and the Al Qadir Trust was running.
Imran insisted that he had no resentment for former president Dr Arif Alvi, saying that he tried his best to resolve the issues. Similarly, he added, his former ally, Sheikh Rashid and former adversary Maulana Fazlur Rehman would be invited to a party gathering on March 23.
