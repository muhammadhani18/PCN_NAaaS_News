0,Court adjourns Fawad’s corruption case hearing,"During preliminary hearing, guard informed court vehicle breakdown prevented Fawad Chaudhary's transport","The hearing of the alleged land corruption case against former federal minister Fawad Chaudhary has been adjourned till April 2 by the Special Anti-Corruption Court.
During the preliminary hearing that took place on Tuesday morning, the police guard told the court that the jail vehicle was broken down, due to which Fawad Chaudhary could not be brought to court. 
Judge Ali Nawaz of the Special Anti-Corruption Court expressed his disapproval at the excuse and said demanded that the defendant be brought to court immediately. “Car breakdown is not our problem,” he said while reprimanding the guard.
About half an hour after being severely admonished by the court, Fawad Chaudhary was produced in the court in the ladies' van. His uncle, former federal minister Chaudhary Shehbaz, his wife, Hiba Chaudhary and younger brother were also present in the court.
Speaking on the occasion, Fawad Chaudhary said “A foreigner has been made the finance minister. He was given Pakistani citizenship after being made a minister. The foreign finance minister has put the country up for sale on OLX under the pretext of privatisation.”
“The interior minister too id not from Muslim League-N. At least, Ishaq Dar and Miftah Ismail were Pakistanis. Things should improve. The deal with the IMF will have no credibility. Government is a product of Form-47, not election. The entire nation is saddened for the martyrs. Their sacrifices and blood will bring colour,” he added expressing his anguish as he maintains that he is being wrongfully detained.
Moreover, Iftar and meetings of prisoners' families have been restricted by court.

2,Dysfunctional elevators grab minister’s attention,"Secretariat’s five out of 14 elevators are currently serving hundreds of employees, visitors","At least nine elevators of the multi-storey building of the Secretariat located in the Red Zone of the federal capital have been malfunctioning for a long time, causing immense inconvenience to hundreds of employees and visitors.   
Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, who sits in the same building, was the first who took notice of the situation and expressed his anger at those responsible.
The company that manages the elevators complains that three times in the last two years, the electrical wires were stolen from the building due to which the elevators are damaged.
The 11-storey Secretariat accommodates 15 ministries including IT, religious affairs, privatisation, anti-narcotics and human rights. As many as 14 elevators were installed in this high-rise out of which only five are working at present.
Of these five elevators, one is reserved for cargo delivery, two for ministers, senior officials and VIPs, and only two elevators are functional for citizens and the ministries’ staff. There are hundreds of officers and officials of these ministries who have to wait for a long for the elevators or climb dozens of stairs.
After spotting a majority of elevators dysfunctional, Abdul Aleem Khan, who recently assumed charge of the privatisation ministry, took notice of this situation, expressed his anger on the concerned authorities and directed them to solve the matter.
The maintenance of the high-rise is the responsibility of the Public Works Department (PWD), a subsidiary of the Ministry of Housing and Works.
When contacted, PWD sub-engineer Haroonur Rasheed said that some thieves stole electricity wires worth millions of rupees from Kohsar Block due to which some elevators were out of order.
“At least three thefts have taken place and complaints have already been lodged with the police. Now we have written a letter to the Ministry of Interior to provide security,” Haroon said.
It is worth noting that the police concerned have yet to trace and arrest the suspects despite having CCTV cameras in the building.

5,Adiala jail ban sparks outcry,Inmates and relatives face distress as ban disrupts traditional Ramazan exchanges,"Thousands of inmates at the Adiala jail and their visitors have been facing a great deal of inconvenience for the last week after authorities disallowed meet-ups and delivery of food items in the name of terrorism threats and heightened security. 
All types of prisoners have been prohibited from meeting their parents, children and relatives for two weeks because of ‘severe’ terrorism threats. Every day, relatives of hundreds of prisoners bring daily food, iftar and Eidul Fitr items including fresh home-cooked food and fruits to the jail but they are sent back.
Jail officials have placed a ban on family visits from March 13 to March 26. After reviewing the report from the jail superintendent, the Punjab Home Department will decide whether to lift the ban on March 26. This means that families won't be able to visit their relatives in prison until the 15th of Ramadan.
The inmates and detainees, who are brought to Rawalpindi courts for appearances in cases, have also complained of non-conducting of meetings with their families in the court’s premises. The Adiala jail currently accommodates more than 7,000 inmates against the capacity of 3,000 inmates.
The prisoners don't have enough money to buy iftar items, toiletries, fruits, and vegetables since the imposition of the ban. Consequently, their families are seen demonstrating outside the jail every day and exchanging arguments with the officials.
Prisoners from all police stations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad are housed in the Adiala jail. Their families come from far-flung regions of Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Murree, Kotli Sattian, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan, Gujjar Khan, Taxila, Bhara Kahu, and Tarnol. The central jail also houses a large number of under-trial accused and convicted prisoners from Attock, Jhelum, and Chakwal as well. The meetings will resume on March 27 if this prohibition lasts for two weeks.
According to the jail’s regulations, families can bring vegetables, fruits, pulses, dates, meat, sugar, tea leaves, cigarettes and other items. After the ban, all food items and essential items are being sold at 200 to 300% exorbitant prices in the prison. A pack of cigarettes is being charged at Rs500, a pack of juice at Rs120, and dates at Rs500 per quarter, while other tea-making items, vegetables and fruits are also being sold at high rates.
As the prisoners run out of money, iftar items including fruits, dates, and pakora are being sold at 100 to 200% expensive prices in the jail. The money will be received from the families as soon as the ban ends.
Citizens visiting their loved ones have lamented the authorities outside the Adiala jail. Naveed Akhtar says he has been visiting the jail for many days to hand over fruits, gram flour, dates, meat, and vegetables to his father in jail for iftar, but the officials are not letting him meet his father, advising him to visit the jail after two weeks.
Ashiq Mahmood said he was warned of arrest when he requested the jail administration to only deliver food items he brought if there was an imminent threat of terrorism. “Islam has given many rights to the prisoners which have been violated,” he added. He sought the intervention of the chief justice of Pakistan and the Islamabad High Court (IHC) chief justice in the matter.
On Tuesday, some prisoners, who were brought to the judicial complex courts for hearing into their cases, raised slogans against the ban and asked that the District and Sessions Judge Rawalpindi pay an emergency visit to the jail for a solution to their genuine problem. They complained that the inmates had run out of vegetables, fruits, pulses, juices and dates because of the ban. They also urged human rights organisations to take immediate notice of the situation.
When contacted, the jail administration said that the restriction would be strictly enforced until March 26 and it would be decided if the jail meetings should be resumed or the ban be continued for an additional week.
A large panaflex has been installed at the jail’s main gate to inform the visitors about the ongoing ban. However, the influential are reportedly meeting their beloved prisoners with the written permission of the concerned courts.
