0,IMF bailout helps stabilise economy,Country’s current account deficit may stay below $2.5b,"Pakistan has seen a marked improvement in its external sector and informed the international Monetary Fund (IMF) that the current account deficit might remain below $2.5 billion this fiscal year, cutting down on the need for some emergency foreign loans.
The finance ministry has shared the revised projections of the current account deficit, economic growth, and external trade with the global lender during the last leg of the $1.1 billion loan tranche negotiations.
The Pakistani authorities have projected a further reduction in the current account deficit on the back of a steep cut in imports and relatively higher exports of certain commodities, according to government sources.
The sources continued that as against the original budgeted $6.1 billion current account deficit, the federal authorities told the IMF that it might now fall to below $2.5 billion in the ongoing fiscal year.
The economic growth rate is now projected at 2.6% for this fiscal year by the Pakistani authorities.
The central bank was even more hawkish and it told the IMF that the deficit might remain around $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, the sources said.
The IMF has not yet shared its final projections of the external sector. However, the Pakistani authorities believed that it might still be higher than the country’s own projections.
The government has projected an economic growth rate of 3.7% and a current account deficit of $4.7 billion for the next fiscal year as well.
This indicates that the new PML- N-led government will not adopt pro-economic growth policies in the fiscal year 2024-25.
During the first review talks, the finance ministry gave the current account deficit projection at $4 billion, which it had now reduced to around $2.5 billion.
The $2.5 billion deficit is equal to 0.7% of the GDP.
The reduced current account deficit will also lessen the need for more foreign borrowings.
Pakistan is finding difficult to arrange fresh loans because of junk credit ratings and estranged economic relations with China.
The sources said the IMF had asked the Pakistani authorities about the non-materialisation of foreign commercial loans worth $600 million from China and delay in lending by the World Bank.
Beijing is now demanding a plan for the settlement of its over Rs500 billion dues on account of energy payments to the Chinese power plants before issuing fresh commercial loans to the country.
However, the government has assured the IMF that it would not release additional funds to the Chinese power plants during this fiscal year.
The Chinese ambassador also met with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday and highlighted the issue of the outstanding payments.
The finance minister expressed his gratitude towards the Chinese leadership for their invaluable support to Pakistan in various sectors, particularly highlighting the rollover of SAFE deposits and the refinancing of commercial loans, which have significantly contributed to the country’s economic stability, the ministry said.
Pakistan’s $2 billion debt payment was due to China on March 23, which it requested Beijing to further roll over.
At the time of the first review of the $3 billion package, the IMF assessed the current account deficit at $5.7 billion.
The sources said the IMF had also hinted at lowering the deficit projection but its exact estimates were unknown.
For the next fiscal year, the finance ministry has estimated the current account deficit at $4.7 billion or 1.2% of the GDP.
During the first eight months of the current fiscal year, the current account deficit has been narrowed down to $1 billion.
Pakistan is still required to make repayments worth $11 billion in the remaining period of this fiscal year.
However, it expects a rollover of $6 billion, leaving behind a requirement of $5 billion.
The finance ministry is hoping that the $1.1 billion tranche received from the IMF as well as some fresh support from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) will cover the repayment needs.
The central bank will also buy dollars from the market to support the repayments and at the same time maintain the reserves at their current levels.
The government also sees the average inflation rate at around 11% in the next fiscal year, pointing out that the government will continue the tight fiscal and monetary policies.
The finance minister said the IMF talks had concluded but did not share any further details.
The parleys began on last Thursday for the completion of the second review of the bailout package, which will lead to the disbursement of the $1.1 billion loan tranche.
The Pakistani authorities on Tuesday hosted a dinner for the visiting IMF delegation after the conclusion of the talks.
US Ambassador Donald Blome also met with the finance minister and underscored his government’s support for the completion of Pakistan’s current Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, according to the American embassy.
After meeting with the US ambassador, the finance minister again rushed back to the venue of the IMF talks to sort out the remaining two outstanding issues in the way of the staff-level agreement.
GDP growth
The sources said that Pakistani authorities informed the global lender that the economic growth rate might remain around 2.6% as against a contraction in the previous fiscal year.
The projected growth rate is below the official target of 3.5%.
The government has been implementing tight monetary policies, adversely affecting the growth rate.
Last week, the finance minister said it had become difficult to conduct business with a 22% interest rate.
Yet, the central bank decided to maintain the interest rate despite the fact that there was significant room available to reduce it.
A major reason behind the low 2.6% growth rate, which is also equal to Pakistan’s population surge, was the dismal performance of the large-scale manufacturing sector.
The industrial sector is adversely hurt by a combination of the restrictions on imports and high interest rates as well as the rising energy prices.
The economic growth remained at 2.1% during the first quarter of this fiscal year on the back of healthy momentum in the agricultural sector.
For the next fiscal year, Pakistani authorities expect an economic growth of 3.7%, indicating that the tight monetary and fiscal policies will continue.
However, any tightening on the fiscal front is lost because of the increased government borrowings for interest payments.
Inflation
The sources said the finance ministry had upward adjusted its inflation forecast for this fiscal year to 24%.
A key reason for the higher inflation is the continuous increase in the prices of electricity and gas.
On Monday, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif raised concerns over the increase in gas and electricity prices under the IMF programme.
The elder Sharif’s statement indicates that their house is divided over the future economic course as his younger brother, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has given the nod to sign a new IMF deal.
Trade deficit
The finance ministry also sees a further cut in the trade deficit and projected it below $22 billion for the ongoing fiscal year.
It has further lowered import estimates to a bit over $52 billion as against the budget estimates of $58 billion.
The export projections are maintained at $30.5 billion by the finance ministry while it still hopes to attract $28.5 billion in foreign remittances in this fiscal year.

2,Zero tolerance for border attacks: PM,"PM, cabinet members to forego salaries, perks","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made a resolute declaration on Wednesday, asserting zero tolerance towards any form of cross-border attacks, as stated in a press release from the PM Office.
""We will unequivocally reject and respond firmly to any act of terrorism originating from across our borders,"" affirmed the prime minister during the inaugural session of the federal cabinet.
In response to recent terrorist incidents within Pakistan, the country undertook intelligence-driven anti-terror operations within Afghanistan. The operations targeted those responsible for attacks resulting in the loss of numerous civilian and law enforcement lives.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Sharif emphasised the imperative to prevent terrorist infiltration from neighbouring territories, reaffirming Pakistan's unwavering stance against such threats.
""We aspire to foster peaceful coexistence with our neighbouring nations and seek to bolster trade and bilateral relations,"" added the prime minister, stressing the importance of regional cooperation in combating terrorism and addressing poverty.
He extended an invitation to neighbouring countries to collaborate in efforts aimed at eradicating terrorism and alleviating poverty, emphasising the shared responsibility in ensuring regional stability and prosperity.

3,12 miners killed in Harnai coal pit blast,"Methane gas triggered explosion, says Balochistan mines inspector","At least 12 miners were killed after a coal pit collapsed following an explosion in Balochistan’s Harnai district, officials and rescuers said on Wednesday.
The bodies of ten more miners were pulled from the mine, officials said, bringing the death toll to 12 after the rescue bid ended.
Balochistan Mines Chief Inspector Abdul Ghani said the mine was filled with methane gas that triggered a powerful blast. The explosion caused the collapse of the mine and 20 miners were trapped inside.
A rescue operation was launched to ensure the unhurt recovery of the trapped coal miners, Abdul Ghani said. He informed that the rescue workers retrieved the dead bodies of 12 coal miners and 8 miners were rescued alive.
The rescue coal miners were shifted to the district headquarters hospital Harnai for medical treatment. He had no information about the condition of the eight coal miners since he was busy shifting the dead bodies to their ancestral places.
""The rescue effort has concluded with the recovery of all 12 dead bodies,"" Abdul Ghani Baloch, chief inspector of mines for Balochistan province, told AFP.
""Two bodies were recovered during the night, with the remaining 10 retrieved early in the morning.""
Abdullah Shahwani, Balochistan's director general of mining, also confirmed the death toll, and said ""Initial reports suggest the incident was caused by methane gas"".
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a statement expressing ""profound sorrow and grief over the loss of precious lives"".
It was initially thought that there were only ten miners involved in the cave-in about 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Quetta city.
Rescue workers from the government mining department and the disaster management agency toiled through the night to reach them.
A group of eight people who were attempting to rescue their colleagues also became trapped for several hours, but were later brought to safety by a government rescue team -- some of them unconscious.
Chief Minister Balochistan, Mir Sarfaraz Bugti took notice of the incident and directed the Provincial Disaster Management
Authority (PDMA) to launch a rescue operation to ensure the unhurt recovery of the trapped miners.
""A risky operation was launched to make sure the recovery of the trapped miners"", Chief Minister Balochistan Mir Sarfaraz Bugti said on X.

Chief Inspector Mines also said that most of the dead belong to the Pishin district of Balochistan and the Achakzai tribe, whose bodies have been sent to their native areas.
A miner working in another coal mine in the area said that the rescue teams of Mines and PDMA arrived late.
He said that there was no proper rescue equipment and arrangement at the spot, so the miners went down to the mine to save their colleagues without taking any safety measures and two of them died.
Hazardous working conditions inside coal mines of Balochistan have claimed scores of precious human lives during the last few years. Such incidents in Dukki, Mach, Quetta, Harnai and other parts of Balochistan have become the order of the day.
""These are black holes"", Sultan Muhammad Khan, the central leader of the mine workers association said. He demanded that the government lodge cases against responsible contractors and mine owners.
""This incident is neither the first nor will it be the last in Balochistan,"" Lala Sultan, head of the Balochistan Coal Mines Workers Federation told AFP.
""Safety measures at coal mines are scarcely implemented. While other provinces have some safety protocols in place, in Balochistan safety is utterly neglected.""
HRCP is deeply alarmed by the deaths of 12 coal miners in a mining accident in Harnai, Balochistan, after a methane gas explosion caused part of the mine to collapse, leaving them trapped.
Unfortunately, coal miners in Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain consistently vulnerable to accidents and explosions due to low levels of awareness of mining hazards, and the lack of safety protocols, contemporary mining and rescue techniques, and personal protective equipment.
The government must investigate the causes of the accident in Harnai and take immediate steps to create a safer working environment for coal miners everywhere, including the urgent ratification of ILO Convention 176 to ensure workplace safety.

4,IMF to release $1.1b after staff level deal,"Pakistan agrees to roll out tax registration scheme for retailers, hike gas and power tariffs","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday announced a preliminary agreement with Pakistan for the release of $1.1 billion last tranche of a $3 billion bailout after Islamabad committed to roll out a compulsory tax registration scheme for retailers and further increase gas and electricity prices on the basis of need.
The announcement was made at the end of the six-day visit of the IMF mission to Pakistan that -- as anticipated -- conclusively ended without any hiccups.
The IMF staff and the Pakistani authorities have reached a staff-level agreement (SLA) on the second and final review under the country’s Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), subject to the approval of the IMF’s Executive Board, said the global lender in a press release.
Upon approval, Pakistan will have access to around $1.1 billion, it added.
The IMF said given the timing of the second mission -- immediately following the formation of the new cabinet -- it expected the review to be considered by its board in late April.
Earlier, the IMF Board was tentatively scheduled to take up Pakistan’s case at the beginning of the next month.
Pakistan’s performance in achieving the programme targets remained commendable and a key role was played by Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal as well as State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad in the successful conclusion of the $3 billion bailout package.
However, the SBA also led to a significant increase in the burden on the people in the shape of higher taxes on the salaried class and an exorbitant hike in the prices of fuel, gas and electricity.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday briefed the federal cabinet on the outcome of the IMF talks, including a commitment to further increase the prices of gas and electricity.
The new government will “continue with the timely implementation of power and gas tariff adjustments to keep average tariffs consistent with cost recovery while protecting the vulnerable through the existing progressive tariff structures, thus avoiding any net circular debt accumulation in FY24,” according to IMF Mission Chief for Pakistan Nathan Porter.
Pakistan has committed with the IMF that it would keep the circular debt restricted to Rs2.310 trillion by June 2024 -- equal to last year’s level.
However, the flow of the debt has already reached Rs2.7 trillion, which the government plans to reduce to the agreed level through a combination of budgeted subsidies and tariff hikes.
An energy ministry official said the electricity prices might be jacked up by around Rs5 per unit to bring the debt down to the agreed levels.
Sources said Pakistan had assured the IMF that it would immediately roll out a new compulsory tax registration scheme for the retailers in five cities -- Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, and Islamabad.
Irrespective of the level of income, every retailer in these five cities will be required to register with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
The scheme will be announced in a couple of days and enforced from April.
“The first tax payment is expected from July,” said a senior FBR official.
The retailers largely remain outside the tax net and pay a paltry sum in taxes.
The IMF has also made adjustments in the FBR’s monthly tax collection targets for the next three months.
The overall annual target may remain the same at Rs9.415 trillion or could be increased by about Rs3 billion.
The IMF has lowered April's target to Rs708 billion but it increased the monthly targets for the next two months.
For the month of May, the new tax target is Rs745 billion as against the earlier target of Rs811 billion. For June, the IMF has increased the target from Rs1.178 trillion to Rs1.254 trillion.
“The new government is committed to continue the policy efforts that started under the current SBA to entrench economic and financial stability for the remainder of this year,” said Porter.
“In particular, the authorities are determined to deliver the FY24 general government primary balance target of Rs401 billion or 0.4% of GDP, with further efforts towards broadening the tax base.”
The low tax base also remained an issue. However, FBR Chairman Malik Amjad Zubair Tiwana told the IMF that the tax authorities were on track to achieve the goal of adding nearly one million new taxpayers in the system.
The total number of taxpayers remained at 4.13 million against 5.9 million in the last tax year.
The FBR said the figure of 4.13 million was still high when compared with the position in March last year.
The IMF said that the SBP also remained committed to maintaining a prudent monetary policy to lower inflation and to ensure exchange rate flexibility. Besides, it added that the SBP also strived to ensure transparency in the operations of the foreign exchange market.
The agreement recognises the strong programme implementation by the SBP and the caretaker set-up in recent months. It also recognises the new government’s intentions for the ongoing policy as well as reform efforts to move Pakistan from stabilisation to a strong and sustainable recovery.
The IMF noted that Pakistan’s economic and financial position had improved in the months since the first review. It added that growth and confidence in the country continued to recover on the back of a prudent policy management as well as the resumption of inflows from multilateral and bilateral partners.
However, it continued that the economic growth was expected to be modest this fiscal year and inflation would remain well above the target.
For the ongoing fiscal year, the government had set the GDP growth target at 3.5% and the inflation at 21%.
However, the finance ministry informed the IMF that the economic growth rate might remain at around 2.6% while the inflation would be over 24%.
The silver lining for the government was the reduction in the current account deficit that the finance ministry had now estimated at $2.5 billion against the budget projections of $6.1 billion.
The IMF said the ongoing policy and reform efforts were required to address Pakistan’s deep-seated economic vulnerabilities.
It continued that the country faced these economic vulnerabilities amid the current challenges posed by elevated foreign as well domestic financing needs and an unsettled external environment.
Porter said Pakistan also expressed an interest in a successor medium-term IMF-supported programme with the aim of permanently resolving the country’s fiscal and external sustainability weaknesses, strengthening its economic recovery as well as laying the foundations for strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth.
He added that the discussions on the new programme “are expected to start in the coming months”.
The IMF has outlined the key objectives of the next programme, listing strengthening public finances including through gradual fiscal consolidation and broadening the tax base, especially in under-taxed sectors as well as improving tax administration to improve debt sustainability, creating space for higher priority development and social assistance spending to protect the vulnerable as its top priority.
The global lender has informed the foreign envoys that Pakistan must tax the construction, retail and wholesale sectors and there was also a need to revisit the National Finance Commission award to compel the provinces to increase their own tax collection.
The IMF said restoring the energy sector’s viability by accelerating cost reducing reforms including through improving electricity transmission and distribution, moving captive power demand to the electricity grid, strengthening distribution company governance and management, and undertaking effective anti-theft efforts will be the second objective of any new bailout package.
The global lender said among the other priorities were returning inflation to target, with a deeper and more transparent flexible foreign exchange market supporting external rebalancing and the rebuilding of foreign reserves.
The next programme will also focus on promoting private-led activity, removal of distortionary protection, advancement of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) reforms to improve the sector’s performance, and scaling-up of investment in human capital to make growth more resilient as well as inclusive, enabling Pakistan to reach its economic potential.

5,Lu sceptical about polls fairness,State Dept official rubbishes Imran cipher conspiracy theory,"US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Donald Lu on Wednesday underscored the importance of transparency and accountability in addressing claims of irregularities, and investigation into allegations of interference or rigging in Pakistan’s recent general elections.
Lu, the man at the centre of a diplomatic cable controversy in Pakistan, came out in public for the first time in two years, rebutting all the charges that either he or the US government was involved in the removal of former prime minister Imran Khan in April 2022.
The US diplomat testified before a subcommittee of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs, titled ‘Pakistan After the Elections: Examining the Future of Democracy in Pakistan and the US-Pakistan Relationship’.
In his testimony, Lu stressed that it was the responsibility of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to ensure the integrity of the electoral process and uphold democratic principles. He pointed out that thousands of petitions had been filed with the ECP.
This, he stressed, underscored the urgency for the ECP to hold those responsible for the alleged rigging accountable in a transparent manner. He hinted at the possibility of re-elections if the claims of poll irregularities were substantiated.
He warned that if Pakistan did not have a democratic process that upheld its own Constitution, “it will be an impediment to our relationship”. He added: “It will retard our ability to have” the bilateral relations in security, trade and others. “All of that suffers if Pakistan is not a full democracy.”
Addressing allegations of a conspiracy involving cypher manipulation, Lu dismissed claims made by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former prime minister Imran Khan. “These allegations… these conspiracy theories are a lie… it is not accurate,” he said. “It is a complete falsehood.”
The cipher controversy first emerged on March 27, 2022, when Imran, while addressing a public rally in Islamabad waved a letter before the crowd, claiming that it was a cipher from a foreign nation that had conspired with his political rivals to have the PTI government ousted through a no-confidence motion.
While the US government officials repeatedly rejected Imran’s allegations, this was for the first time that a detailed account came from Lu himself, whose meeting with the then ambassador, Asad Majeed, was at the heart of conspiracy allegations.
“I have reviewed the press reporting related to this, what is called the cipher in Pakistan, the alleged leaked diplomatic cable from the embassy here,” Lu responded to a question raised by the subcommittee chair at the outset of the proceedings.
“It is not accurate. At no point does it accuse the US government or me personally of taking steps against Imran Khan. And thirdly, the other person in the meeting, the then-ambassador of Pakistan to the US, has testified to his own government that there was no conspiracy,” he said.
He added that the US respected Pakistan’s sovereignty. “We respect the principle that Pakistani people should be the only ones to choose their own leaders through a democratic process,” the assistant secretary of state stressed.

The subcommittee endorsed his stance. The reaction from the members suggested that Lu was provided a platform to put the record straight regarding the oft-repeated allegations by the PTI and its founder Imran Khan.
During its proceedings, Lu’s response was met with chants of “liar” by certain people, present there, who were later removed by the chair. He replied in the negative, when a subcommittee member asked if the US asked for Imran’s removal from power after his visit to Russia.
Lu was also asked about the status of press freedom, access to social media platforms, and the issue of Exit Control List (ECL) in Pakistan. “We are talking to the Pakistani government at the highest levels about these issues,” he said, adding that there were laws, and that the US was pursuing the matter.
In his testimony, Lu reiterated that the State Department’s observations regarding the Pakistani elections. “We were particularly concerned about electoral abuses and violence that happened in the weeks leading up to the polls,” he said.
In this regard, he mentioned attacks on police, politicians and political gatherings by terrorist groups; harassment and abuse of journalists, particularly female journalists by party supporters and “several political leaders were disadvantaged by the inability to register specific candidates and political parties”.
“We condemn the electoral violence and restrictions on human and fundamental rights and restriction on internet services,” he continued. He revealed that election monitors had said that they were barred from observing vote tabulation in “more than half of the constituencies across the country”.
A lawmaker questioned Lu whether the State Department had conducted its own investigation into the general elections. Lu replied that certain actions were being taken such as monitoring of the process to address poll irregularities.
Govt reactionTarar condemned the PTI’s conspiracy and its anti-state moves, including May 9 riots and protests outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters for derailing Pakistan’s standby agreement.
“The PTI hired lobbyists in the US for a congressional hearing on the so-called regime change conspiracy, but their leader could not evade the divine justice,” he said. “Hiring of the lobbyists … was solely meant to malign the country, but it was the PTI founder who was declared a “certified liar” in the end.”
The minister said the US diplomat had not only exposed the “cipher drama”, but also expressed satisfaction over the credibility of the general election as well as women empowerment in Pakistan during the proceeding.
