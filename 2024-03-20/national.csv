0,RDAs bring in only $141m in Feb,Inflows remain below average receipt of $178m per month,"Pakistan received $141 million through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) from overseas Pakistanis in February, bringing total inflows to nearly $7.5 billion in the first 42 months of the scheme to date.
Although the latest monthly inflows remained below the average receipt of $178 million per month since the introduction of the accounts in September 2020, they played a significant role in stabilising the country’s foreign exchange reserves and supporting the rupee against the US dollar and other major currencies.
Inflows have consistently lagged below the monthly average since the outbreak of political crisis in the country two years ago. Political upheavals have disrupted domestic economic activities and eroded confidence among expatriates in the national leadership.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Yousuf Rahman, Head of Research at KASB Securities, anticipates that inflows have the potential to return to near-peak levels of $250 million per month or more, translating into a gross inflow of at least $3 billion annually. He estimates that inflows will gradually improve to their potential level after the successful conclusion of ongoing talks for the last tranche of $1.1 billion and the securing of a new, larger, and longer-tenured package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), following the completion of the ongoing $3 billion programme in March-April 2024.
The acquisition of a new loan programme could instil confidence in overseas Pakistanis that the country has a solid plan to repay maturing foreign debt on time. This will encourage them to inject more funds into the domestic economy, as the rate of returns on investment instruments designed especially for them remains attractive, he said.
Furthermore, the new loan programme would support policymakers in gradually increasing economic activities and achieving political stability. Both political and economic stability should encourage them to invest their savings in Pakistan, which offers good returns in line with global practices.
Despite previous revisions by the government to increase the rate of return on foreign currency- and rupee-denominated local bonds for overseas Pakistanis, inflows have decreased over time.
RDA data breakdown
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, gross inflows increased to $7.48 billion in the month under review from $7.34 billion in the prior month of January 2024.
The breakup of the data suggests that net inflows currently stand at $1.25 billion. Non-resident Pakistanis have withdrawn $1.56 billion out of the total dispatches in the past 42 months and utilised another $4.67 billion in the homeland.
Out of the total repatriable funds amounting to $1.25 billion, they have invested $304 million in conventional Naya Pakistan Certificates (NPC), injected another $501 million in Shariah-compliant NPC, purchased shares worth $32 million at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), parked $392 million in accounts in banks in Pakistan, while other liabilities stood at $24 million.
Rupee closes stable
The Pakistani currency closed stable at a five-and-a-half-month high of Rs278.63 against the US dollar in the interbank market, maintaining the previous four-day gains on Tuesday.
The currency maintained the closing level for the second successive day amid a one-day extension in the ongoing talks with the IMF for the next tranche of $1.1 billion under the near-completion $3 billion loan programme and for securing a new loan programme once the current programme concludes in March-April 2024.
Additionally, the release of RDA numbers during the day likely encouraged importers and exporters to keep the rupee-dollar parity stable.
According to SBP data, the domestic currency has cumulatively strengthened by 10.21% or Rs28.47 in the past over six months to date compared to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ hit in the first week of September 2023.
Market talks suggest that the maintenance of the policy rate by the central bank at a record 22% on Monday supported the rupee to remain strong, as any rate cut would have increased demand for the greenback and caused a slight depreciation in the local currency.
The talks of China and other bilateral creditors rolling over deposits worth over $2 billion also supported the rupee to remain steady.
In the open market, the currency extended gains by Rs0.05 on a day-to-day basis, surging to Rs281.15 against the greenback, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
Rahman said the high policy rate and high inflation have suppressed aggregate demand in the domestic economy, resulting in low demand for foreign currency for imports compared to better supplies.

1,"Bitcoin slides 6%, while altcoins sparkle",But performance has not been as weak across the broader crypto complex,"Bitcoin fell by as much as 6.5% on Tuesday, on track for its largest one-day drop in two weeks, as a wave of selling hit cryptocurrencies and other risk assets, such as stocks.
The price was last down 5.86% at $63,419, having dropped to a two-week low of $62,966, while ether fell 6.39% to $3,283.
Bitcoin is still showing a 52% gain for the year so far, as investors have piled into US exchange-traded funds backed by spot bitcoin.
The price hit a record high of nearly $74,000 on Thursday last week, which has triggered some profit-taking, along with a series of US data releases that suggested the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates this year as much as previously thought.
In the last week, bitcoin has fallen by nearly 9%, set for its largest week-on-week decline since last September, while ether has lost 13% following an upgrade to the underlying ethereum network.
But performance has not been as weak across the broader crypto complex.
Smaller tokens, known also as “altcoins”, have drawn in flows of their own. The solana network’s sol token has gained 19% in the latest week, while avalanche’s avax coin has risen by 17%, according to Coingecko. “In light of bitcoin’s recent all-time high and subsequent correction, we anticipate a period of market recalibration as investors seek equilibrium amidst unprecedented inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs,” analysts at exchange Bitfinex said in a note.

3,Pakistan asked to reap benefits of Vietnam FTAs,Envoy stresses both nations can take advantage of each other’s strength,"Vietnam has asked Pakistan to avail itself of the opportunities arising from free trade agreements (FTAs) Hanoi has signed with the European Union, the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and other nations while at the same time Vietnam can benefit from Islamabad’s GSP Plus status.
“Vietnam and Pakistan can use each other’s strength,” remarked Vietnam Ambassador Nguyen Tien Phong while talking to Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President Kashif Anwar at the LCCI office.
The envoy called Pakistan a big country with vast potential that could be utilised for promoting trade between Vietnam and Pakistan.
He emphasised the need for forging business-to-business and people-to-people contacts and floated the idea of issuing e-visas to promote business activities.
He highlighted the potential sectors where the two countries could collaborate, which particularly included tourism, and said exchange of delegations and linkages were important. Pointing to the significance of textile sector, the ambassador pointed out that Vietnam imported yarn and cotton from Pakistan, produced garments and exported to the EU, Japan and the US. Similarly, “Pakistan can also import fibre from Vietnam to produce fabrics for exports.”

He mentioned information technology as another critical area where affiliations were important as Vietnam “is currently associated with Japan, India, South Korea and other countries”.
Agriculture is another very important sector, which can deliver fruitful results. The envoy cited Vietnam’s success from being a food-insecure country before 1986 to the third biggest rice exporter in 1989. He also underscored the trade and investment potential of other sectors such as Halal food, seafood and fish farming.
Speaking on the occasion, LCCI President Kashif Anwar said that Vietnam and Pakistan had been enjoying sound diplomatic relations for more than 50 years, which were formally established in 1972. In addition, they are engaged in trade and economic cooperation in diverse fields.
“On the path of rapid economic growth, Vietnam made impressive progress in industrial, agricultural and services sectors. It was the result of broad-based economic transformation, which opened Vietnamese economy to international markets and foreign trade.”
Global exports of Vietnam have surpassed $370 billion while its global imports have crossed $358 billion. “We have a lot to learn from Vietnam economic model,” he remarked.

4,Refinery likely to slash investment in plant upgrade,May inject just $500m against earlier plans of investing up to $3b,"Pakistan may lose a planned investment of over $2 billion in the oil refining sector as a shareholder of Pak Arab Refinery Limited (Parco) has refused to give its backing to the original plant upgrade plan.
Under the plan, Parco, a joint venture between the governments of Pakistan and Abu Dhabi, was poised to invest up to $3 billion under the new refinery policy for setting up cracking units to convert furnace oil into highly demanded byproducts like petrol and high-speed diesel.
The government has set the deadline of March 20 for signing implementation agreements with refineries under the new policy for upgrading their plants. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is set to attend the signing ceremony.
Sources told The Express Tribune that three refineries – Parco, Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) and Byco – had agreed to reduce the production of furnace oil to zero by setting up cracking units. These units convert furnace oil into petrol and high-speed diesel.
However, Parco shareholders have not endorsed the plan as they now want to invest around $500 million in the production of Euro V-standard petrol and diesel.
At the same time, they want to see the refinery continue to produce furnace oil like Attock Refinery Limited (ARL) and National Refinery Limited (NRL). ARL produces furnace oil because it consumes the local crude oil while NRL produces furnace oil for its own requirement.

These refineries will also install advanced plants for the production of environmentally friendly Euro V petrol and diesel. The new refinery policy had remained stuck on the table of then petroleum minister for around two years during the tenure of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government.
However, the caretaker government later made a bold decision by approving the policy. During the interim administration, the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE) approved the new policy, which enhanced the ceiling on withdrawing money from an escrow account from 25% to 27.5%.
PRL has already signed an agreement with the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) under the new refinery policy. Now, it will ink a supplemental agreement after approval of amendments to the new policy.
Other refineries have so far not struck any deal and have raised several issues like the continuation of 7.5% deemed duty collection on diesel sales after upgrading their plants.
Their concerns also included the tax exemption on incremental capital expenditure to be deposited in the escrow account, project timelines and cost overruns.
During the caretaker government, the CCOE raised the cap on the withdrawal of money from the escrow account from 25% to 27.5%. This money will be spent on upgrading the refineries.
Under the new policy, Pakistan is expected to become self-reliant in the production of diesel.
The oil industry emphasises that the energy sector is the backbone of any economy but unfortunately the core challenges being faced in the realm of economy stem from ill-planning and mismanagement.
The industry points out that finalisation of the badly needed policy took more than four years as final approval was delayed on one pretext or the other.
The policy was notified on August 17, 2023 but it had some anomalies, which were not acceptable to the refineries.
After intense and prolonged consultations among the government, refineries, independent financial and legal advisory firms, the policy was appropriately amended and approved by the CCOE in a meeting chaired by the then caretaker energy minister, Muhammad Ali.
The policy will enable oil refineries to undertake major upgrade projects to not only comply with environmentally friendly Euro V specifications but also increase the production of deficit products such as petrol and diesel by 99% and 47%, respectively.

5,C/A achieves surplus for 2nd month in a row,"Surplus signals external stability, but import controls impact industrial output","Pakistan’s current account balance posted a surplus for the second consecutive month in Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24), reaching $128 million in February. While this reduces external pressure on the economy, it comes at the expense of industrial activities.
The surplus is attributed to several factors, including reduced repatriation of profits by foreign companies, lower spending on technology and Information Technology (IT) imports, and relatively fewer payments for foreign services such as airlines.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the balance was in deficit at $303 million in January 2024 and $50 million in February 2023. Consequently, the cumulative current account deficit for the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of the fiscal year 2023-24 fell to below $1 billion ($999 million), compared to $3.85 billion in the same period last year, marking a significant 74% reduction.

Topline Securities, CEO, Muhammad Sohail noted that Pakistan has achieved a current account surplus exceeding $600 million in the past 12 months (from March 2023 to February 2024). He attributed this surplus to measures such as currency devaluation, higher interest rates, and other policy steps that effectively curbed import demand.
Looking ahead, he stressed the importance for the new government to maintain this disciplined approach to ensure much-needed economic stability. He stated, “Continued adherence to such measures will be essential for sustaining and further improving Pakistan’s economic outlook.”
However, controlled imports have adversely affected industrial output, slowing overall economic activities in FY24. Goods imports decreased by 6% to $4.27 billion in February compared to $4.55 billion in January 2024. Similarly, goods exports slowed by 5% to $2.56 billion in the month compared to $2.70 billion in the prior month. Additionally, workers’ remittances decreased by 6% to $2.25 billion in February.

6,FPCCI for building farm infrastructure,Presses govt to speed up provision of electricity in farming areas under SIFC,"The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Standing Committee on Agriculture recommends the Fauji Foundation to set up roads, canal systems, and electricity infrastructure in corporate farming areas under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which were identified for investors, especially in the Cholistan belt.
The Convenor of FPCCI Agriculture Standing Committee, Chaudhry Ahmad Jawad, said the military and federal government are determined to take up the agricultural sector under SIFC, which is positive for the country, but the infrastructure for investors has not yet been seen. It needs to be sped up, he said.
Jawad mentioned that under the banner of the SIFC, the Fauji Foundation has created a company to help manage corporate farming projects, and many local companies are signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs).

He further stressed that we must understand we are at a crucial crossroads regarding agriculture. The current situation is such that the country’s population is growing at a higher rate than food production. In this year’s international ranking of the Global Hunger Index (GHI), the country ranked 92 out of 116 nations, with its hunger categorised as ‘serious.’ Pakistan currently faces a scenario in which it is largely food-sufficient but not food-secure.
Despite Pakistan being ranked 8th in wheat production, 10th in rice, 5th in sugarcane, and 4th in milk production, a 2019 report by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed that nearly 37% of households in Pakistan are food insecure. In the three years since the SBP’s report, matters have only worsened. Food price inflation in Pakistan has been in double digits since August 2019. According to figures published by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the cost of food has been 10.4-19.5% higher than the previous year in urban areas and 12.6-23.8% in rural areas.

7,Unilever to spin off ice cream business,"Aims to cut 7,500 jobs for cost savings, affecting about 5.9% of 128,000 employees","Unilever said on Tuesday it would spin off its ice cream unit, home to popular brands such as Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s, and cut 7,500 jobs in a new cost-savings programme.
Investors cheered the plan, sending shares in Unilever, one of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies, up nearly 6% at one point.
The spinoff will begin immediately and is expected to complete by the end of 2025, London-listed Unilever said. The ice cream business is “in the process of moving to a separate head office in Amsterdam” but CEO Hein Schumacher said on a call with journalists that he was “open to options” regarding where it could list.
The plan was welcomed by activist investor and board member Nelson Peltz’s fund and by Unilever shareholder Aviva.
Unilever said it aims to deliver mid-single-digit underlying sales growth and modest margin improvement after the split. The ice cream business accounts for about 16% of Unilever’s global sales, and in some countries contributes a third, or 40%.
The group, whose other brands include Dove soap, Marmite and Hellmann’s condiments, also launched a programme to save costs of around 800 million euros ($869 million) over the next three years. The proposed changes would impact around 7,500 jobs globally, mostly office-based, with total restructuring costs anticipated to be around 1.2% of overall turnover during the period.

The cuts will affect about 5.9% of Unilever’s workforce of about 128,000 people.
“We are looking across the organisation, so in our head office, corporate centre, as well as in business group coordination points, as well as in business units in countries,” Schumacher said, but did not elaborate on which regions would be hit hardest by job cuts.
The move is a big statement from Schumacher, who became CEO in July and in October laid out plans to win back investor confidence by simplifying the business after admitting Unilever had underperformed in recent years. His predecessor Alan Jope was criticised for allowing the group’s brand portfolio to grow to about 400, leaving management distracted from its best performers.
The underperformance attracted the attention of billionaire activist investor Peltz, who took a seat on Unilever’s board in 2022 via his Trian investment vehicle and has a record of shaking up consumer goods companies. The fund, which owns a 1.45% stake according to LSEG data, told Reuters on Tuesday it “supports the strategic initiatives announced today by Unilever.”

8,Stocks spike as SBP keeps rate on hold,"KSE-100 index rises 612.09 points, settles at 65,502.60","Pakistan Stock Exchange on Tuesday extended its gains from the previous day as it surged over 600 points following military strikes on terrorist hideouts and announcement of monetary policy where the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the policy rate unchanged.
In the morning, trading began on a positive note, but soon the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day low of 64,940.17 points. It swiftly rebounded and breached the 65,000 barrier. The index reached the intra-day high of 65,624.72 points after midday.
The upbeat market sentiment was primarily driven by expectations of an imminent staff-level agreement on the conclusion of last review under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement (SBA), coupled with SBP governor’s assurance of a $2 billion loan rollover in two weeks.
Moreover, plans to seek an additional $4 billion in rollovers boosted investor confidence, which helped lift the index. Notably, banking, fertiliser and exploration and production (E&P) sectors saw increased buying interest.
The market managed to maintain its upward trajectory for most of the day and closed above 65,000 with substantial gains.
“Stocks closed bullish after Pakistan hit TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) hideouts in response to terror attacks and the SBP maintained the status quo in its key policy rate,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
Read: Stocks lose ground in range-bound trading
“Speculations about imminent staff-level agreement in the wake of final IMF review talks and the SBP governor’s assurance of a $2 billion loan rollover in two weeks and plans to seek $4 billion in further rollovers played the role catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 612.09 points, or 0.94%, and settled at 65,502.60.
Topline Securities reported that positivity in the market could be attributed to the SBP deciding to keep the policy rate unchanged at 22%.
“A surge in buying activity swept through the market, with banking, fertiliser and E&P sectors emerging as the day’s primary beneficiaries,” it said.
MCB Bank, Meezan Bank, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Bank AL Habib, Engro Fertilisers, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Pakistan Oilfields and Mari Petroleum cumulatively added 319 points to the index.
Investors’ interest was mainly witnessed in the banking sector where Habib Metropolitan Bank (+4.85%), MCB Bank (+3.09%), Meezan Bank (+2.52%) and United Bank (+0.80%) closed higher than the previous day, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, commented that a constructive session was witnessed following the guessing game on whether the SBP would cut the rate or not.
Dawood Hercules Corp (+7.26%), MCB Bank (+3.08%) and Meezan Bank (+2.52%) were the biggest contributors to the index’s gains, it said, adding that Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Telecommunication Company both gained the maximum.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that bullish momentum persisted as the KSE-100 surged to the intra-day high of 65,625 before concluding the session at 65,503, gaining 612 points.
“Going forward, we anticipate the bullish trend to continue. We advise investors to capitalise on any downtrend as an opportunity to invest in banking, cement and E&P sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 323.3 million shares against Monday’s tally of 211.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs17.1 billion.
Shares of 341 companies were traded. Of these, 184 stocks closed higher, 140 dropped and 17 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 27.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.38. It was followed by Telecard Limited with 20.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.23 to close at Rs9.23 and The Bank of Punjab with 17.9 million shares, losing Rs0.09 to close at Rs6.14.
Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs465 million, according to the NCCPL.

9,Auto industry forced to slash prices,"Firms compelled to reduce margins, navigate taxes, inflation to bolster sales","Auto experts state that a combination of factors, including weakened purchasing power, heavy taxation, rampant inflation, and currency devaluation, has compelled auto companies to slash prices. This move, while reducing profit margins, benefits customers and lends support to the struggling industry.
Expressing frustration with poor economic policies, market analysts told The Express Tribune that the recent government decision to hike sales tax on vehicles with engine sizes of 1,400CC and above, as well as those priced above Rs4 million, from 18% to 25%, has adversely affected the auto sector. They highlight that this increase in sales tax, enforced by the government and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), prompted auto companies to lower prices, sacrifice profit margins, and devise customer-friendly strategies.
For instance, if companies had passed on the entire 7% increase in sales tax to vehicles priced slightly above Rs4 million, customers would have faced a hike of at least Rs280,000 per unit. However, instead of passing on this burden to customers, companies opted to reduce prices to keep these vehicles within the 18% sales tax bracket. Ultimately, customers bear the brunt of these sales taxes.
Experts identify four major challenges—high interest rates, heavy taxation, rupee devaluation, and inflation—as significantly impacting the auto industry. They stress the need for the government to formulate consistent and pragmatic policies to stimulate sector growth, warning that without such measures, auto plants may become economically unviable, leading to increased unemployment.

“In 2021-2022, over 300,000 vehicles were sold with the government collecting hefty taxes. However, given the current economic challenges, including high interest rates and inflation, the imposition of further taxes is expected to drastically reduce car sales, with projections ranging from 80,000 to 90,000 units during 2023-2024,” remarks Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) Chairman Abdul Rehman Aizaz.
Honda Atlas Cars has reduced prices of two City variants to Rs4.649 million and Rs4.689 million, marking reductions of Rs50,000 and Rs140,000, respectively. Similarly, Indus Motor Company (IMC) recently reduced prices across its Yaris sedan lineup, with decreases ranging from Rs73,000 to Rs133,000. The price adjustments apply to four Yaris variants, now priced between Rs4,326,000 and Rs4,766,000 per unit.
CEO of IMC, Ali Asghar Jamali, attributed the price reductions to an internal strategy, providing no further details.
According to Waqas Ghani, Deputy Head of Research at JS Global, reduced inflationary pressure, coupled with low interest rates in car financing, is expected to boost sales in the near future.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Abrar Polani, a research analyst at brokerage house Arif Habib Limited (AHL), noted a contraction in local auto market demand. The decrease in auto prices aims to facilitate industry recovery.
