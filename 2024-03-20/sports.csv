0,DUHS launches locally-produced anti-rabies vaccine,‘Dow Rab’ can be supplied to dog bite victim within 48 hours,"Dow University of Health and Sciences (DUHS) has introduced ‘Dow Rab’, an anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) designed specifically for dog bite victims.
The newly-introduced vaccine, developed by the varsity, can now be accessed with a simple phone call, initially serving people living in Sindh and later will be extending its availability nationwide.
The vaccine will be delivered to the desired location within forty-eight hours of a phone call.
DUHS Vice-Chancellor Professor Muhammad Saeed Quraishi launched the ‘Dow Rab’ during a ceremony on Tuesday.
Speaking on the occasion, Quraishi said that an initial supply of 30,000 doses of ‘Dow Rab’ has been distributed through the network, manufactured at the Dow Institute of Life Sciences (DILS) located at the Ojha campus, utilising imported raw materials.
Expressing determination, Professor Quraishi emphasised plans to produce the vaccine's raw materials locally, thereby reducing dependency on imports, particularly from China. Efforts are underway to scale up production, with a target of producing an additional 170,000 doses of ARV in the near future.
Quraishi highlighted the culmination of extensive research and regulatory processes, culminating in the commercial production of the vaccine at the Ojha campus. The complete course of the vaccine will be available for Rs1,500, he said.
DUHS previously had developed IVIG Immunoglobulin during the Covid-19 pandemic, which played a crucial role in saving lives of numerous patients.
Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the varsity and the distribution network Muller and Phipps to ensure the phased availability of ARV Dow Rab across Pakistan.
Each year, approximately a million people in Pakistan fall victim to stray dog bites, leading to an estimated 5,000-6,000 deaths from rabies. The National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad reports a national demand for over two million doses of ARV annually, a significant portion of which is imported from the neighbouring country.
The ceremony was attended by key figures including DILS CEO, Syed Izhar Hussain, along with Tariq Shahid Director Marketing and many other notable health experts.

4,Second postmortem of deceased housemaid ordered,The initial postmortem report indicated that the cause of death was strangulation,"Following the death of a housemaid, who was employed in the residence and clinic of some doctors in Latifabad, a second postmortem was conducted by a board formed on a court's order on Monday night. The postmortem report is expected to provide insights into the cause of death, initially claimed to be a suicide by the deceased housemaid’s employers, 20-year-old Abdul Rehman Samejo.
In response to protests from Samejo’s family, the B-Section police registered an FIR on March 16 against Dr Muhammad Naeem Babur, his wife Mehwish Naeem, and her brother Dr Saddam Chohan. Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate Rehana Ahsan ordered the Sindh Health Department on Monday to constitute a board for another postmortem of Samejo, in response to a petition filed by his father, Malook Samejo.

During the hearing, concerns were raised about the manner in which the initial postmortem was conducted, implicating the nominated suspects, police, and the doctors who performed the autopsy. It was alleged that the accused had moved the deceased's body to the hospital without informing police, an act considered tampering with evidence at a crime scene.
Moreover, it was argued that the family's consent, a legal requirement, was not obtained for the postmortem. According to the complainant in the FIR, Habibullah Samejo, an uncle of the deceased, he was informed about his nephew's death via a call from Dr Saddam.
He was asked to collect the body from Hilal-e-Ahmer Hospital in Latifabad and was informed that his nephew had allegedly committed suicide late on March 15, around 11:30pm, by hanging himself on a wall-mounted hanger in a washroom. Habibullah objected to the postmortem being conducted without the family's consent.
The initial postmortem report indicated that the cause of death was strangulation, resulting in airway blockage, asphyxia, and cardiorespiratory failure. It also noted the absence of any signs of violence on the body. The accused have reportedly been granted bail. The civil court is scheduled to reconvene on March 21 to hear the case.
