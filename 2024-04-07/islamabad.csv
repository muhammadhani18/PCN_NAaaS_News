0,RDA takes notice of alleged illegal construction in Bahria Town,"Director general says some under-construction buildings in Phase 8 sealed, warning issued against encroaching amenity plots","RAWALPINDI: The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has taken notice of alleged illegal construction and encroachments in Bahria Town after a visit to the area by its team on the complaint of residents of the society. 
RDA Director General Kinza Murtaza told Dawn that the residents of Bahria Town under the banner of an association met her and pointed out illegal construction and encroachments on plots reserved for green areas, parks, drainage system and roads.
She said she formed a team comprising RDA Director Jamshaid Aftab and building control branch officials which visited the site and found illegal activities in the housing scheme.
She said the residents pointed out that the layout plan of the housing scheme’s Phase 8 had not been uploaded on the RDA website. Upon this, Ms Murtaza said, she asked the RDA information technology branch to upload all layout plans of approved housing schemes under administrative control of the RDA.

Director general says some under-construction buildings in Phase 8 sealed, warning issued against encroaching amenity plots

Ms Murtaza said there were some genuine issues in Bahria Town Phase-8 and the RDA had sealed some under-construction buildings and issued warning against encroaching amenity plots.
Apart from this, she said the RDA would launch an awareness campaign to sensitise people not to invest in any illegal housing scheme.
“As many as 59 housing schemes in Rawalpindi are legal while all others are illegal. We have prepared a list which will be displayed on a banner outside the commissioner’s office for public awareness from Monday,” she said.
Ms Murtaza said Commissioner Aamir Khattak had also taken notice of illegal activities in housing schemes and directed to compile data so necessary action would be taken against the owners soon.
Earlier, an association of the residents of Bahria Town in a video on social media alleged unauthorised construction and encroachments on amenity plots, roads and parks in the society creating problems for the residents and traders.
In the video, Tahir Nihad Bajwa, the president of the association called Brace, said on April 4, RDA Director General Kinza Murtaza sent a team on the request of the association that visited 
various sites in Bahria Town Phase-1 to Phase-8 to check encroachments by the society administration and collected evidence.
At the same time, he said, some unknown people, perhaps not aware of the facts, held a protest against Dawn newspaper for publishing a story regarding illegal activities in Bahria Town Karachi.
“The facts published by Dawn are research based and showed courage to highlight illegal activities of the housing society,” Mr Bajwa said, adding that facts could be verified and understood by any educated person.
Following the joint visit of the RDA and Brace teams, Mr Bajwa said an inspection was carried out by the director of RDA planning across specified locations in Bahria Town.
“This effort aimed to audit the current state of the areas against approved layouts and document any discrepancies, particularly focusing on the Soan River bank areas, Overseas-1 and 2 and the Business District,” he said.
He said the inspection confirmed several violations, leading to a resolute decision to take immediate action against Bahria Town and real estate agencies.
Mr Bajwa said they had been living in Bahria Town since 2012 and since then the management had raised maintenance charges, electricity bills by more than 40pc in the society compared to other localities.
He said the business community also faced numerous problems as the society failed to maintain rules and regulations in line with government policy.

5,IHC turns down plea against acquittal of Sialkot-based family,ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has dismissed a petition seeking legal proceedings against a family...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has dismissed a petition seeking legal proceedings against a family implicated in the fake cases by a senior government official.
IHC Justice Babar Sattar on March 18 reserved the judgement on the petition of a Capital Development Authority (CDA) officer, Iftikhar Ali Haideri, against the orders of a magistrate acquitting a Sialkot-based family nominated in a case registered in the Industrial Area police station of Islamabad.
The family was booked in multiple FIRs in Islamabad allegedly for manhandling the brother of the CDA officer in Sialkot.
A recent investigation by Superintendent of Police Rukhsar Mehdi of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) termed the registration of criminal cases against the family as a “mockery of the justice system.”
The inquiry had kickstarted after a woman had approached police against the registration of FIRs against her husband, son, grandson, and daughter in the Sumbal, Banigala, Industrial Area police stations in Islamabad and Sialkot.
Superintendent of Police Rukhsar Mehdi in his report said: “There is one government officer Iftikhar Ali Haideri [who] played havoc with the entire justice system.”
As per the report, Mr Haideri’s brother Qamar Abbas had a brawl with the applicant’s family in Sialkot and since then the officer “was trying to settle his score by twisting the long arm of law”.
The report stated: “This entire plot hatched by this government officer is shameless but the height of the shame is when an innocent young lady got arrested by the Gujrat police and later on by the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police in false and criminal cases on the day she was to wed.”
“What a shame and dishonour inflicted on her and her immediate family,” the report added. The report recommended that the “officer Mr Iftikhar Ali Haideri must answer for whatever dirty games he played”.
The investigation found that “the FIRs of Sumbal and Banigala police stations are false whereas the implication of the victims in Industrial Area Police Station is a lie”.
The report further recommended that “the said government officer must face the law of the land for violating it so ruthlessly”.
IHC dismissal
The judicial magistrate of the Industrial Area Police Station discharged the accused persons from the case; Mr Haideri, on the other hand, had filed a petition before the IHC against the said order.
He stated in the petition that the judicial magistrate discharged the accused without sending him on physical remand. During the hearing on March 18, the court was apprised that SP Rukhsar Mehdi recently probed the matter and submitted a report before the police.
Justice Sattar said: “In view of the record produced before the court, including the report of the SP stating that the complainant has lodged false FIRs, including FIR No.1043, which forms the subject-matter of the instant case and the finding of the judicial magistrate that at the time of alleged occurrence, the accused was in Sialkot and not in Islamabad and could therefore not have been involved with the occurrence.”
The IHC judge said the court was not convinced that the impugned order was unjust, unfair, unreasonable, or otherwise qualified as colourable exercise of the administrative authority vested in the magistrate under Section 63 of CrPC. The learned judge, however, did not issue any direction regarding the registration of the fake FIRs.

6,Judiciary last hope against all forms of tyrannies: speakers,"Mr Babar said the pliant and PCO judges legitimised repeated military interventions, abrogation of constitutions and murder of an elected prime minister.","ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a webinar on Saturday said judiciary was the last hope of justice against all forms of tyrannies in society.
Speaking at Devcom-Pakistan’s public forum, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) Vice Chancellor Dr Nadeemul Haq said: “Our system is the extension of the colonial system and we are forced to live in it, not likely to come out of it very soon. Politicians lack capacity to understand the legislation-making process and also lack planning and management skills. They only want to come to power by abusing the system and that encourages non-political forces to intervene in every state institution.”
Former Senator Farhatullah Babar said independence of judiciary was enshrined in all the three constitutions of 1956, 1962 and 1973 and enhanced by jurisprudence like the Al-Jehad Trust case. The judiciary has security of tenure, adequate emoluments and pensions and exemption from accountability by the executive, elements necessary for its independence.
“However, judiciary’s independence has been undermined by repeated martial laws on the one hand and by pliant and compromised PCO judges who readily took oath of allegiance to the dictator on the other,” he said. 
Mr Babar said the pliant and PCO judges legitimised repeated military interventions, abrogation of constitutions, murder of an elected prime minister, dissolution of assemblies and political parties and much worse, not once but many times over. 
He said: “The judiciary needs to be supported in this by all other institutions taking similar steps for course correction. The letter by the judges is also an opportunity for politicians, generals, media and the people to correct their course.”
Executive Director Devcom-Pakistan Munir Ahmed said: “The judiciary serves as a check on the executive and legislative branches of government, and any undue influence from intelligence agencies weakens this vital function.”
Development expert Qaiser Aijaz said Justice Munir’s legacy shall end now.
“Now the institutions have been exposed for their manoeuvred decisions, illogical pressures and lack of transparency. All the civil society and general public shall stand by the independent judiciary and say no to all the pressures. The judiciary also needs to exercise their powers rationally, and without succumbing to any pressures,” he added.
Journalist Sadia Rasheed and social worker Amina Sadaf also participated in the webinar.

He was speaking to participants of a dialogue titled ‘Challenges in Implementation of Islamabad Disability Act 2022’ organised by Potohar Mental Health Association (PMHA) on Saturday.
Mr Babar, who is also Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Human Rights Cellpresident, said: “We need to work for attitudinal change. Since the legislation was enacted in 1981, we have certainly come a long way in the past 40 years. Our focus should be to stress for rules of business of the law enacted. Special quotas for political inclusionof persons living with disabilities should be established all over Pakistan. It is very alarming that the data of Census 2023 has yet not been published and this will lead to further discrimination and marginalisation of persons living with disabilities.”
“It is very important to have accurate data about persons living with disabilities so that resources can be allocated accordingly. A good progressive legislation on persons living with disabilities should be based on four parameters – including comprehensive definition, address socio-cultural and political impediment, mitigate institutional hurdles and ensure accessible infrastructure,” he added.
PMHA Chief Executive Zulqarnain Asgharand co-chair Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) Munizae Jahangir said women professionals in media were not even given infrastructural support what to talk about those with special abilities.
They were of the view that corporate social responsibility should be applicable in media as well, adding that Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists should systematically provide support to people living with disabilities.
HRCP council member Sadia Bokhari said the status of women was labouring under patriarchal norms and their existence became especially difficult if they were also specially-abled.
“In these circumstances it is imperative that the rules of business should be formed as soon as possible for the Islamabad Disability Act 2022 and existing gender blind spots removed,” she added.
Former information commissioner Zahid Abdullah emphasised that the language used to describe disability was problematic because instead of portraying a special ability it brought them down by highlighting their inadequacies.
Former National Commission on Child Rights chairperson Afshan Tehseen Bajwa said the government should ensure that implementation was firmly in place after making it inclusive and effective by understanding and catering for their special needs.
“This law needs improvement in several areas and can certainly be improved upon by taking into consideration the law enacted in Sindh and Punjab,” she said.

The decision was made during a meeting between Minister for Industry and Production and National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain and Iranian Ambassador Dr Reza Amiri Moghaddam.
Dr Moghaddam noted that the Iranian president expects to sign a MoU on livestock quarantine and plant protection between the two countries during his upcoming visit. “We want to import more meat, rice, and agricultural products, especially mangoes and kinnoo, from Pakistan. Iranian people are very fond of Pakistani kinnoo,” he said.
The ambassador also reiterated Iran’s desire to further strengthen its relations with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest.
“Iran’s top leadership is in favor of increasing close cooperation with Pakistan in all fields,” he said, adding that both countries can cooperate in the fertiliser industry.
The Iranian Minister of Industry has invited the federal minister to visit Tehran to participate in the upcoming meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
Federal Minister Rana Tanveer stated that both Pakistan and Iran were brothers and neighbors. “Iran and Pakistan share a strong bond. Basmati rice from Pakistan is famous all over the world. Both countries can work on industrial cooperation,” he added.
On the directions of the prime minister, special attention was being given to industry and agricultural development, the federal minister said, adding, “Development of agriculture and industry will lead to significant improvement in livelihoods and will play a role in the restoration of the economy, which is the top priority of government.”
Even healthy-looking animals can carry diseases, and as Pakistan and Iran are neighbouring countries, diseases can be transmitted from one country to another through animals.

10,Schools operating in commercial areas asked to ‘regularise’ by April 30,"RDA chief says fines to be imposed, building will be sealed after deadline","RAWALPINDI: The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) on Saturday extended a deadline to shift the private educational institutions in the city’s residential areas by the end of this academic year ending April 30.
RDA Director General Kinza Murtaza told Dawn that the authority asked the private schools to shift their outlets from residential areas by the end of this month. She said the owners of ‘illegal’ schools had to furnish an affidavit within 15 days stating that either they were ready to regularise their schools or stop their activities in the building (school), she said.
The schools operating in commercial areas, particularly roads, would have to convert their buildings to ‘commercial’ after paying a commercialisation fee. She said non-profit schools would have to furnish a certificate from the Federal Board of Revenue to avail incentive in the commercialisation fees.
She said that those schools which did not shift in the stipulated time would be sealed after the expiry of the deadline and fines would be imposed as well. She said that the building owners would have to pay a fine of Rs1,000 per day until the regularisation of their premises.

RDA chief says fines to be imposed, building will be sealed after deadline

“Since the school owners have not filed this affidavit yet, they are given a final chance to file this affidavit within seven days, otherwise legal action will be taken against them and the school will be closed and a fine will be collected. The term of the next academic year 2024 will be till April 30,” she added.
More than 100 schools are operating in the jurisdiction of the RDA in the garrison city, often leading to congestion on the roads during rush hours.
Similarly, due to constricted parking spaces in schools and colleges, people have to park their vehicles on roads and streets.
After a survey of the city, the Rawalpindi Development Authority in the first month of this year issued notices to 63 educational institutions located on main roads. The notices asked the owners to regularise their buildings by paying a 10 per cent fee for commercial use of the premises or shift to a different place.
These educational institutions are operating in Asghar Mall Scheme, Mohanpura, Saidpur Road, Satellite Town, Murree Road, Dhoke Khabba and other areas.
Last year, then Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha asked the district and cantonment authorities to take action against the educational institutions, hospitals, and other commercial centres on main roads to arrange their parking space. He asked all the schools, hospitals and other commercial establishments on main roads to manage their parking within their premises.

13,Two more Safe City cameras stolen,"ISLAMABAD: Two more cameras of the Safe City Project were found stolen in the federal capital, police said on...","ISLAMABAD: Two more cameras of the Safe City Project were found stolen in the federal capital, police said on Saturday. Since September 2023, as many as five cameras have been stolen in the city. 
The police said recently two cameras installed on the expressway, about two kilometres from the Koral police station, were stolen. However, the incident came to the knowledge of the police after five days.
An officer of the Safe City told Dawn that two cameras installed on the Koral flyover near the police station were found inoperative on the night of March 31. The monitoring room stopped receiving footage/view from the two cameras, but at that time no serious action was taken over it, he added.
On April 5, a technical team from the Safe City Authority was sent to the spot which found the two cameras worth Rs1.1 million stolen, the officer said, adding the team also found that an attempt was made to steal a cabinet, which had a battery to supply power to the camera.
Preliminary investigations suggested that the cameras were stolen on the night of March 31 while the attempt was made to steal the cabinet on April 1, the officer said.
Over the theft, a case was registered with Koral police station against unidentified thieves in response to a complaint lodged by Coordinator Safe City Islamabad Ahmad Hassan.
In September 2023, thieves stole a camera of Safe City Project installed a furlong away from the Margalla police station. The camera was stolen on September 2; however the authority came to know about the theft after two weeks.
The camera was found inoperative on the night of September 2 as no footage/view was received from it. However, even then no efforts were made by the police to check the camera except writing a report and verbally communicating the matter to a senior officer concerned.
After two weeks, a team from the Safe City Authority visited the spot and found the camera missing/stolen. The camera was valued at Rs120,000 when it was installed.
On March 28, 2024, two cameras and two cabinets of the Safe City Project installed near the Koral police station were stolen. The cameras and the cabinets were worth Rs1.1 million.
The issue was brought to the knowledge of the senior officer concerned, and Koral police were approached for registration of a case, the officer said, adding that a case had been registered in response to a complaint lodged by in-charge field coordinator Abdul Kabir.
The $125 million Safe City Project was launched in 2016 for the security and safety of the city and its residents besides prevention of crime and terrorism and arrest of criminals and terrorists. However, officers of the Safe City and the capital police rarely utilised the project for its main aim, the officer said. 
There were also a number of theft incidents that took place in front of the Safe City cameras. However, the police failed to prevent such thefts or arrest the culprits, he added.
Talking to Dawn, another officer said there were over 2,500 cameras of Safe City installed in the city. However, there were only 125 screens at the Safe City Authority building for monitoring them. It is therefore not possible to keep an eye on every camera at a time, he added.
