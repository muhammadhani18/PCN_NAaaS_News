“To achieve health equity in the country, it is essential to raise awareness and work towards ensuring every person’s right to attain the highest possible level of health and well-being,” said Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Secretary General Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro.
This year’s World Health Day, which is being observed on Sunday (today), is dedicated to the theme “Building a fairer, healthier world” with the slogan “My health, my right”.
“The day is a grim reminder that many individuals, especially those residing in rural areas and low-income communities, in our country encounter obstacles preventing them from accessing essential healthcare services,” said Dr Shoro.
On behalf of the PMA-Centre, Dr Shoro said it recognised the importance of increased government investment in the health sector to improve health infrastructure and ensure the availability of necessary medications and treatments.
He also called upon healthcare professionals to realise their collective responsibility in advocating health equity. “Engaging in community outreach programmes, conducting health education campaigns, and collaborating with policymakers will contribute positively towards creating a healthcare system that leaves no individual behind. Additionally, we need to focus on training and retaining healthcare professionals in underserved areas.”
Children’s health conference
Meanwhile, speakers at the 32nd International Children Health Conference held online in connection with World Health Day at Hamdard Public School called for collaboration among all stakeholders to overcome Pakistan’s healthcare challenges. 
In his address, WHO representative in Pakistan Dr Luo Dapeng spoke about the myriad challenges confronting the global community, while underscoring the need for prioritizing individual health.
Hamdard Foundation Pakistan president Sadia Rashid informed the audience about the organisation’s services, emphasising that it remained committed to advancing health and education in the country.
Dr Raza-ur-Rahman spoke about the importance of mental health and called for comprehensive measures that could ensure well-being of the masses.
During the conference, young delegates representing Pakistan, the United States, Australia, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka shared insightful perspectives on the topic on the day, while emphasising the significance of cultivating a culture of integrity.
Some speakers also shared their concern over the presence of poliovirus in Pakistan and Afghanistan, despite its eradication elsewhere in the world. 
A delegate from Afghanistan urged Pakistan to invest in the healthcare sector of Afghanistan.

• Asks IGP to ensure registration of FIRs of street crime victims
• Meeting okays dedicated units to carry out operation in riverine area
KARACHI: Sindh High Court Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi on Saturday ordered the law enforcement agencies to launch a crackdown on criminals, their handlers and facilitators to curb street crime in Karachi and improve security situation in other parts of the province, particularly the riverine area.
He directed the police to establish pickets and enhance patrolling. A criminals’ database shall be maintained and their computerised national identity cards (CNICs) be blocked and proceedings of proclamation and attachment of their properties be initiated, he ordered.
 
 

The chief justice issued these directives while chairing a meeting of the Provincial Judicial Committee (PJC) — a provincial forum responsible for ensuring effective administration, operation and development of a fair, impartial and inclusive rule of law and to address provincial law, justice and security challenges.
The PJC is a forum of provincial inter-organisational coordination and cooperation and such meetings often take place at all high courts across the country.
The meeting was attended by SHC’s senior puisne judge Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui, director general of Pakistan Rangers Sindh, Major General Azhar Waqas, Home Secretary Mohammad Iqbal Memon, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, Advocate General Hasan Abkar, Prosecutor General Faiz Shah, members of inspection team-SHC (MIT-I & II) Asif Majid and Sadaf Khokhar, representatives of bar associations and other officials.
Official sources said that the chief justice asked the Rangers to work with Sindh police in investigation of cases.
It was also decided in the meeting that dedicated units of police and Rangers would be organised to carry out an operation in riverine areas of Kandhkot, Shikarpur and Ghotki.
Chief Justice Abbasi also directed the law enforcement agencies to launch a crackdown on drug traffickers, check the sale of stolen properties/goods, and take action against illegal business of renting of bikes and weapons.
He also directed the IGP to ensure registration of FIRs of victims of street crimes, identify black sheep in police force and bring them to task.
 
 

The law enforcement agencies were directed to ensure that highways and motorways in the province be made secure by increasing patrolling.
The CJ decided to convene another meeting of the PJC after 15 days to monitor the performance of law enforcement agencies in restoring law and order.
The IGP and Rangers chief briefed the meeting on the law and order situation in the province and submitted reports.
Talking to the media after attending the meeting, Sindh High Court Bar Association president Rehan Aziz Malik and Karachi Bar Association president Amir Nawaz Warraich said that the chief justice had also expressed resentment over sudden transfers and postings in the police department.
They said that the Rangers chief informed the meeting that the paramilitary force had special policing powers only in Karachi and there was a need to grant such powers so that the force could act in other parts of the province.
They said that besides several other matters, the issues of street crimes in Karachi, activities of dacoit gangs in the riverine area and the safe city project came under discussion.

4,Probe blames ‘systemic’ issues for shortage of free textbooks in Sindh,Inquiry conducted by CMIT absolves ex-STBB chief Sohail of all charges.,"KARACHI: An inquiry against the former chairman of Sindh Textbook Board (STBB) into the shortage of free textbooks for students of public schools across the province has attributed the issue to systemic shortcomings, underlining the need for administrative reforms to prevent similar occurrences in the future, it emerged on Friday.
The inquiry report also highlighted that the allocated budget for free textbooks was not sufficient to meet the required quantity, leading to persistent shortages as the former STBB chairman Agha Sohail Ahmed had repeatedly sought enhancements in budgetary allocations to address the issue.
 
 

The inquiry also exonerated the former STBB chairman from all charges, stating that no evidence was found to established “mismanagement and inefficiency on his part.
Inquiry Officer Rafique A Buriro, the chairman of Chief Minister’s Inspection and Inquiry Team (CMIT), in his report, a copy of which is provided to Dawn, on March 11 said that the inquiry against the former STB chairman was initiated by the provincial caretaker government on Nov 13, last year.

Inquiry conducted by CMIT absolves ex-STBB chief Sohail of all charges

“I am of the opinion that the charges of inefficacy, mismanagement and omission do not sustain against Agha Sohail Ahmed as these are unfounded and may be dropped in the interest of justice,” he said.
The inquiry officer further said in the report that the charges against the officer under inquiry lost significance as he was assigned the task of meeting the shortage of free textbooks on an emergency basis after the shortage was reported in the media.
“Had the officer been known as inefficient and negligent manager of government affairs, he may never have been assigned such a crucial task at the very critical stage in the academic year of the students in public sector schools,” the inquiry officer said.
He concluded: “I am of the firm opinion that Agha Sohail Ahmed may be exonerated from the charges …He may be reinstated in service.”
As per the allegations, the STBB chairman was alleged to have committed the acts of inefficiency, mismanagement and misconduct in the delayed printing of textbooks despite the release of Rs2,53,000,000/- during 2022-23. It was reported that the shortage of textbooks ranged from 50 per cent to 70pc.

5,K-IV fate still hangs in balance as Centre yet to give final approval,Murad to request prime minister for release of Rs30-40bn funds for much-delayed project.,"KARACHI: The fate of the much-awaited Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, commonly known as K-IV, still hangs in balance as the federal government has been dragging its feet in its final approval for the past two years, it emerged on Saturday.
Official sources said that the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) had in August 2023 conditionally approved the PC-1 of the project, that also included Rs74 billion K-IV Augmentation Project to be carried out by the Sindh government and funded by World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
They said that the federal government had asked the provincial government to give justification of cost increase of Rs40bn.
The sources said that the provincial government had submitted to the federal government its revised compliance report, giving justification of increase in the cost of the project on Feb 13, 2024, but it was still pending under review at the planning commission for the issuance of authorisation to the provincial government.

Murad to request prime minister for release of Rs30-40bn funds for much-delayed project

They said that the matter would be again placed before the ECNEC for its final approval.
On Saturday, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah reviewed the progress of the ongoing K-IV project and set September 2025 as the timeline for the completion of the components being undertaken by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda).
He said that he would discuss the Augmentation Project with the federal government, which had been pending since March 2022.
He directed the Karachi Water & Sewerage Corporation to start consultancy of the augmentation works for which he would arrange the funds.
The meeting, held at the CM House, was attended among others by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Planning and Development chairman Najam Shah, Local Government Secretary Khalid Hyder Shah, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi, Irrigation Secretary Zarif Khero and KWSC CEO Syed Salahuddin Ahmed.
The CM was told that K-IV mainstream works were being implemented by Wapda and its 100 per cent funding of Rs126bn would be made by the federal government.
The CM was told that there were eight contract packages which were awarded in the construction phase.
He was told that in March 2024, World Bank mission was informed that Rs40.36bn were released against the allocation of Rs52.62bn and the main reason for its possible delay was the unavailability of funds timely.
The chief minister said that he would talk to the federal government to release Rs30-40bn allocated in its PSDP.
The meeting also discussed the Rs40bn KB Feeder Lining project being funded by the federal and the provincial government. It would be executed by the irrigation department.
The CM was told that as per the water balance study conducted by KWSSIP, the water for K-IV could only be extracted by Keenjhar if the KB feeder upper was lined.
The CM said that the World Bank wanted the irrigation department to expedite the completion of the procurement process. 
The irrigation secretary told the CM that the KB feeder upper lining project was in the tendering process and the bids were expected to be received in the second week of April.
The CM was told that the trench for laying pipeline PL-I had a length of 65.19 km, of which 63.3 km was completed, 1.49 km was under process and 0.4 km was a disputed area.
The CM directed the chief secretary to get the land disputes redressed.
As far as PL-2 was concerned, the CM was told that it had a length of 47.69 km, out of which 26.79 km had been completed while work on 13.7 km was under process and 7.2 km under litigation. The CM directed his legal team to get the cases cleared and expedite the work.
The CM was told that in the federal public sector development programme, Rs52.6bn was allocated against which Rs45.6bn had been released which has been utilised. Now, Rs30bn to Rs40bn were required to expedite the work. 
The chief minister said that he would request the prime minister to release the amount so that the much-delayed project of K-IV could be completed.

6,"‘I wanted to write about Nazimabad, about Karachi’",The Empty Room author Sadia Abbas expresses her fondness for Quratulain Hyder,"KARACHI: The Writers and Readers Café held its weekly session at the Arts Council’s Josh Malihabadi Library with Dr Sadia Abbas, the author of the novel The Empty Room and associate professor of English Literature at Rutgers University, USA. 
Answering the first question about the autobiographical elements in the novel at the event, which was moderated by Dr Omair Ahmed Khan and Palvashay Sethi, Dr Abbas said her husband was a westerner who had a PhD in Philosophy from Harvard; they got married in 1996. “It is about as autobiographical as a novel that Virginia Woolf could write.” 
Whether she consciously avoided to not to write about herself, the writer replied, “What was more important to me was the UP culture that existed in Nazimabad in the 1970s which was autobiographical in the sense that my whole family settled there [after migration]. My nana used to live in Block F and my dada lived in Federal B Area. So to that extent it is autobiographical. It’s about a neighbourhood and the UP intellectuals that settled in Nazimabad… for me that Karachi was important. Also, the culture of Karachi University, the leftists and the student movement there… was important.”
She said, “I’m a conceptual animal. To me the question was: what is a novel? You could say that The Empty Room is an anti-marriage novel. The marriage plot was one of the forms of the novel in the 18th century and the Urdu novel has come out of that tradition. To some extent I wanted to write against the marriage plot. The second thought was that I did not want to write the standard novel, the bourgeois form which is about the individual’s development. I wanted to write about the world. I wanted to write about Karachi, about Nazimabad. The other thing was: how do you undo the bourgeois novel?”

The Empty Room author Sadia Abbas expresses her fondness for Quratulain Hyder 

Responding to a query on the representation of visual art in her novel, something that can also be found in Quratulain Hyder’s writings, Dr Abbas said, “I love the visual. There are two things that I wish I could do: sing and paint. I started to paint to experience the world that Tahira [the protagonist of The Empty Room] was experiencing. What does it feel like to hold the paintbrush? Tahira is an artist, painting is her vocation but (unhappy) marriage halts her painting practice. How do women create [art] in a prison, is actually the big question of the novel.”
She then expressed her fondness for Quratulain Hyder as a writer and a philosopher with reference to her books Aakhir-i-Shab Ke Hamsafar and Aag Ka Darya, and as a visual writer. 
Dr Abbas has also authored At Freedom’s Limit: Islam and the Postcolonial Predicament.

7,Experts highlight shortage of paediatric surgeons in country,"Say Pakistan has only 200 surgeons while 1,250 are needed","KARACHI: The country is relying on less than 200 paediatric surgeons compared to the required number of over 1,250, which puts lives of thousands of infants and children in Pakistan at risk, a body of medical experts and healthcare professionals warned on Saturday.
It referred to the fresh data which suggests that around 33 per cent of Pakistan’s population is comprised of children less than 15 years of age, but only 0.2 paediatric surgeons are available for 100,000 people in the country. In the developed countries, like the United States, they say, where hardly 16pc of the population is of 15 years of age, the ratio is 2.6 paediatric surgeons for 100,000 people.
“Around 2.5 million new-born children die annually in Pakistan, of which 26,492 deaths occur because of congenital anomalies alone,” said Prof Dr Muhammad Arshad, president of the Association of Pediatric Surgeons of Pakistan (APSP).
“A large number of these children can be saved by increasing the number of paediatric surgeons and posting them at District Headquarter (DHQ) hospitals across Pakistan. Congenital anomalies are the fifth leading cause of deaths in Pakistan, while thousands of more children die due to trauma and other health conditions including cancer, kidney stones, and others.”

Say Pakistan has only 200 surgeons while 1,250 are needed

If the country has the required number of paediatric surgeons serving at public health facilities on the district level, he claimed, most of those precious lives could be saved.
As World Paediatric Surgery Day is marked on Sunday (today), he said, specialised children’s hospitals had been set up in major urban centres like Karachi and Lahore but they were extremely overburdened.
“Children who require elective surgeries often have to wait for five to six months for their turn, resulting in serious, life-threatening complications,” said Dr Arshad.
“Often when children requiring surgeries are brought to the specialised medical centres, due to the delay in diagnosis, they already have developed complications, including sepsis, which makes their treatment extremely difficult and many of them die even after surgeries and treatment,” he added.
He was of the view that paediatric surgeons played a crucial role in providing specialised care to infants, children, and adolescents, particularly in diagnosing and treating surgical conditions unique to that population.
However, the shortage of those skilled professionals had strained the healthcare infrastructure and hindered access to timely and quality surgical care for children in need.
“The shortage of paediatric surgeons in Pakistan is multifaceted, stemming from various challenges within the healthcare system,” said Dr Arshad.
“One primary issue is the limited number of training programs and educational opportunities available for aspiring paediatric surgeons. Despite the growing demand for paediatric surgical services, there are only a handful of institutions in Pakistan offering formal training in paediatric surgery. This scarcity of training programs has contributed to a dearth of qualified paediatric surgeons entering the workforce,” he added.

8,Proposal sought for energising small villages through solar power,KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday directed the energy department to prepare a detailed ...,"KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday directed the energy department to prepare a detailed proposal for the solarisation of small isolated villages under the Village Electrification Program.
While chairing a meeting to review Sindh Solar Energy Project at the CM House, he said that isolated villages’ electrification through solar/wind hybrid could be carried out on Public-Private Partnership mode, adding that the private sector would be assigned the task to run the system in a sustainable manner.
Mr Shah said that the private sector would bear the running expenses of the system, including salaries of the technical staff and the provincial government would bear periodic expenses of battery replacements.
Energy Minister Nasir Shah told the meeting that the Sindh Solar Energy Project (SSEP) was an initiative of the provincial government with the World Bank financing of a $100 million concessional loan approved by ECNEC in Nov 2018 and revised in July 2023.
He said that the project had four components, establishment of 400 MW solar parks through competitive bidding, solarisation of 50 MW public sector building, solar home systems to provide electricity to 200,000 households and capacity building by setting up a solar testing laboratory and training of solar technicians.
The meeting was informed that three pieces of land were allotted in Jan 2023, including 250 acres for 50 MW at Manjhand, Jamshoro, 612 acres for 120 MW in Deh Halkani /Murad Band, district West and 600 acres for 150 MW in Deh Mitha Ghar, district Malir.
Energy minister told the CM that the feasibility studies of the Manjhand and Karachi sites had been completed and added that the expression of interest for the prequalification process had been completed.
The CM was told that there was a target of 50 MW rooftop solar system on 110 public sector buildings. A 4-MW floating solar with battery backup near Ghulam Muhammad Barrage Hyderabad would be installed.
The CM was told that the under solar home system, the original implementation of the component was not successful due to a subsidy of only 40 per cent and the high costs of the system which resulted in only 322 systems being sold.

9,Harassment suspect remanded in police custody for three days,KARACHI: A judicial magistrate has remanded a suspect in police custody for sexually harassing a veiled woman when...,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate has remanded a suspect in police custody for sexually harassing a veiled woman when she was walking down a street near Manghopir Road within the jurisdiction of the Pak Colony police station.
The investigating officer (IO) brought the suspect before Judicial Magistrate (West) Asadullah Qureshi, requesting 14-day remand for further interrogation.
According to the FIR, it was revealed that a complaint was lodged by a police inspector after receiving a video which captured an incident where a man purportedly attempted to sexually harass a veiled woman passer-by in a street.
Upon viewing the video, the police investigated the case and discovered that the alleged perpetrator was often seen there.
On Thursday, the police apprehended the suspect, who confessed to his offence while in police custody.
The CCTV footage shows the woman walking alone on a deserted street, where a man suddenly approaches her from behind and groped her. He corners her for a moment before quickly running away.
The IO informed the court that statements from witnesses had been recorded, and requested additional time to gather information regarding the victim woman and to interrogate the suspect.
In the courtroom, the suspect did not raise any complaint regarding maltreatment. 
Meanwhile, the counsel for the suspect submitted an application requesting bail, arguing that the alleged offence was bailable.
However, the court dismissed the plea, noting that the case was registered under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Pakistan Penal Code, which falls under scheduled sections of the Anti-Rape Act 2021 and is a non-bailable offence.
After hearing the arguments, the court remanded the suspect in police custody for three days and instructed the IO to produce him in court on April 8.

The protesters started the procession from Global Chowk and reached Dolphin Chowk where local party leaders Faqeer Inayat Buriro, Bachal Mahar, Ismail Soomro and others addressed them and said that the district was on fire while SSP was busy receiving ajraks and topis.
They said that crime rate had shot up across the district because the only merit of the heads of police stations posted across the district was their being “sycophants” of the ruling party.  “Police seem to be hand in glove with criminals that’s why law and order situation remains in a shambles in Sukkur,” they said.
They said that the criminals had targeted the party members and supporters. More than 60 party sympathisers had been looted and several of them had been left wounded by robbers when they put up resistance, they said, adding that police did not take action against the criminals despite having identified them. 
The protesters demanded that Chief Justice, Sindh IGP and Sukkur DIG take notice of the alarming rise in crimes and direct officials concerned to take immediate steps to restore law and order to the district.

14,Prosecution witness cross-examined in NAB reference against Shoro brothers,"Minister faces landgrabbing, misuse of authority, default on fee payment allegations","HYDERABAD: An Accountability Court on Saturday heard National Accountability Bureau’s Rs5.02 billion reference against Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro, his younger brother Kashif Shoro (now mayor of Hyderabad) and their alleged accomplices. 
The matter pertained to alleged usurpation of state-owned land by the accused, misuse of authority by the former minister while holding different portfolios between 2013 and 2018 to receive undue favours in getting the land’s status changed, and causing heavy losses to the provincial kitty by grabbing government land and defaulting on payment of prescribed fees for commercialisation of the property.
The NAB reference has nominated a government officer Sajjad Hyder, Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA) officer Shahid Pervez Memon; former deputy district officer (revenue) Bachal Rahupoto and 13 others as co-accused. Two of them have already died.
The matter was adjourned to May 4 after one more prosecution witness, former HDA director planning and development control Bashir Ahmed Awan, was cross-examined by Jam Khan Shoro’s counsel Zarar Qadir on behalf of defence counsel Sarmad Hani.

Bashir Awan had earlier filed his statement stating that commercialisation of land was processed by his predecessors through proper channel and the authorities concerned had confirmed that the accused owned the land. In his previous statement, Awan had mentioned that the survey No. 511, where the accused’s house was located, showed it as the land for ‘headworks of irrigation department’.
Jam claims it’s his ancestral land
Jam Khan Shoro says that the survey numbers in question were part of Jam Khan Shoro village and these are kabulli lands which his family had inherited from forefathers. Our forefathers had an undivided share of 67pc whereas 33pc was owned by legal heirs of late Mohammad Bux Shoro, he insists.
However, a NAB inquiry concluded that the nominated accused in connivance with each other and by misusing authority, usurped precious government land admeasuring 20-13 acres worth Rs5.02bn in Qasimabad taluka of Hyderabad district. 
Prosecution’s ‘star witness’ 
So far, three prosecution witnesses have been cross-examined in the case by the defence side. They included ‘star witness’ Imamuddin Larik, a land record officer (LRO). Larik had informed the court that survey No. 511 as well as survey Nos. 2, 3, 4 in Jamshoro were actually land for headworks of Kotri Barrage. 
In its inquiry, NAB had concluded that the accused in connivance with each other and by misusing authority, usurped precious government land admeasuring 20-13 acres worth Rs5.02bn in Qasimabad taluka of Hyderabad district. 
It alleged that the minister had usurped state land by changing location of his private land (4-30 acres) bearing survey Nos. 2, 3 and 4 at northern boundary line of Jamshoro. It further alleged that the land had an approximate commercial value of Rs2.758bn as per the current valuation notification. The co-accused and MPA’s relative Karan Khan (paternal cousin and son of former Qasimabad taluka nazim Noor Mohammad Shoro) usurped 11-10 acres in Deh Jamshoro in connivance with others. The land’s commercial value was assessed at Rs30,000 per sq-yds therefore a loss of Rs2.261bn was caused to national kitty, it maintained.
The NAB probe revealed that Kashif Shoro applied for correction of ghat-wadh (+/-) form. Accused (now deceased) Khuda Dino Shoro, who was then director of settlement survey and land records, vide his letter dated June 2, 2014, had issued directives illegally to land record officer for correction of such form; and such form was illegally issued.
‘Misuse of authority by minister’
The reference had accused Jam Shoro of misusing his authority as minister livestock between June 2013 and Nov 2015 and minister for local bodies between Nov 2015 and May 2018. NAB said Jam in connivance with others obtained favour for himself and his relative by usurping precious state land by swapping location of land on main Jamshoro road.
Bashir Awan, in his statement, had said that Jam Khan Shoro had applied for approval of site plan for change of status from residential to commercial for land admeasuring 4-acres 30 ghuntas in survey Nos. 2, 3 and 4 of Deh Jamshoro. He said that as per HDA zonal plan, the land where the site plan of said survey numbers was approved was already reserved for headworks of irrigation department and original location of the land vide survey Nos. 2, 3 and 4 of Deh Jamshoro was between old and new Phuleli canal which was not commercial land.
Default on payments
He said that actual fee for commercialisation of these survey numbers was Rs22,919,115 as per revised rates of fee/charges. However, he added, Shahid Pervez Memon, then additional director planning and development control of HDA had illegally reduced fees/charges and approved fees at Rs15,846,240. He also mentioned that as per the office record, an amount of Rs1,320,270 was received from Jam Khan Shoro on account of commercialisation and approval of site plan whereas Rs21,598,845 was outstanding for which no post-dated cheques were received from him by the HDA.
He said that Rs2,643,200 was calculated as fees/charges by HDA in respect of survey number No511 and an amount of Rs385,825 were received by HDA so far from Master Karan Khan Shoro and all post-dated cheques equivalent to Rs2257,376 bounced/returned, thus Rs2,257,376 was outstanding.

16,JIT yet to find any clue to Priya Kumari,"SUKKUR: The new joint investigation team (JIT), formed by the home department to help find a clue to Priya Kumari, a...","SUKKUR: The new joint investigation team (JIT), formed by the home department to help find a clue to Priya Kumari, a minor who had mysteriously disappeared while serving drinking water to mourners at a sabeel near Sangrar town of Sukkur district on the eve of Ashura on Aug 19, 2021, seems to have been groping in the dark as it is yet to get any reliable information to start work on.
The JIT, headed by Mirpurkhas DIG Javed Jiskani with Hyderabad SSP Amjad Ali Shaikh, Shaheed Benazirabad SSP Tunveer Hussain Tunio and two DSPs being its other members, was formed on April 2 under mounting public pressure and has been given three weeks to accomplish its task.
The team held a press conference in Sukkur SSP’s office on late Thursday evening to appeal to the members of the general public to come forward with the required information.
DIG Jiskani, observing that the previous JIT, formed a few weeks after the incident could not work properly on the given task, said it was indeed a difficult case. “But we will try our best to ascertain facts regarding the girl’s disappearance,” he said.
Priya Kumari was about seven years old when she went missing and the incident had sparked a series of protests across Sindh. However, the struggle by civil society organisations lost vigour with the passage of time. In recent weeks, Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz and Awami Tehreek revived the issue by spearheading their respective campaigns to mobilise civil society and other nationalist groups again prompting the home department to constitute the new JIT. 
DIG Jiskani said the team would not be carried away by unreliable media reports and speculations about the matter. “Rather, we will record statements of those who will offer pieces of relevant information based on facts so that we could conduct our investigation in the right direction,” he added.   
The senior police officer said Priya Kumari’s relatives should first come forward to share their views about her possible kidnapping as believe by her parents. If they have doubt on anyone about involvement in the matter, they should feel free to share it with the JIT, he said, assuring them of confidentiality.
The JIT chief also asked those who had been taking part in street protests to help JIT locate the girl, instead.
The investigators also urged the general public to “pray for their success” in accomplishing the uphill task.
