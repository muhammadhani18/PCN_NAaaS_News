1,Sharjeel continues crackdown on overcharging of transport fares,"At least 1,012 vehicles scrutinized, unlawfully extorted amount of Rs2,285,000 recovered","Sindh Senior Minister and Provincial Minister for Transport, Mass Transit, and Excise and Taxation, Sharjeel Inam Memon has taken a resolute stand against the pervasive issue of overcharging fares in the transport sector, said a statement released on Sunday.
The Provincial Transport Authority (PTA), Regional Transport Authority (RTA), and District Regional Transport Authorities (DRTAs) conducted inspections on inter-city and inter-provincial passenger vehicles.
The crackdown is being conducted by the RTA officers in collaboration with traffic police, district police, and motorway police.
A total of 1,012 vehicles have undergone scrutiny thus far, revealing that an excess amount of Rs2,285,000 had been unlawfully extorted from passengers, which was promptly refunded on the spot.
Transporters found guilty of engaging in the exploitative practice were charged a fine of Rs732,000.
""The aim is to eliminate the problems and difficulties faced by passengers,"" said Memon.

He warned, ""Strict action will be taken against those who try to take advantage of the compulsion of passengers.Those who do injustice to passengers will not be forgiven.""
Memon urged transporters to adhere to ethical standards and prioritize the comfort and safety of passengers above all else.
On March 28, Memon chaired a high-level meeting of the transport department and discussed projects aimed at improving inter-city commutes.
The meeting focused on multiple projects including the Orange Line and Green Line that will be soon connected by a shuttle service to Tower right after Eidul Fitr.
The minister shared the Sindh government’s plan to start inter-city bus service with an initial 500 buses purchased for the convenience of the people under the inter-district transport project.
Amidst rising petroleum prices, transport terminal proprietors throughout the district have hiked fares across all routes by Rs100 to Rs300 in light of the approaching Eid ul Fitr festivities.
Additionally, local route tariffs have seen increments ranging from Rs5 to Rs10.

2,Mexico breaks relations with Ecuador after embassy stormed,Police had forcefully entered Mexico's embassy in Quito before arresting President Andres,"Ecuadorean authorities arrested former Vice President Jorge Glas on Friday evening, seizing him from the Mexican embassy and prompting Mexico to suspend bilateral relations.
Glas, 54, convicted twice of corruption, had been holed up in the embassy in Quito since seeking political asylum in December, a request Mexico granted earlier on Friday.
Police forcefully entered Mexico's embassy in Quito before making the arrest, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador posted on X (formerly Twitter).
The Ecuadorean president's office said in a statement it had arrested Glas, who was vice president under the leftist government of Rafael Correa between 2013 and 2017.
Sonia Vera, the international lawyer for Glas, said by telephone that his team was requesting help on an inter-American level with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, as well as with the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly.
There was a heavy military presence at the magistrates court in the Andean capital, where the former vice president was taken.
The arrest caps a week of escalating tensions between Mexico and Ecuador, which on Thursday declared Mexico's ambassador in Quito persona non grata, citing ""unfortunate"" comments from the leftist President Lopez Obrador.
Ecuador contends that Mexico's asylum offer was illegal.
In a statement, Ecuador's presidency accused Mexico of ""having abused the immunities and privileges granted to the diplomatic mission that housed the former vice president, and granting diplomatic asylum contrary to the conventional legal framework.""
Lopez Obrador said he had instructed Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Barcena to suspend diplomatic ties with Ecuador, calling the arrest an ""authoritarian"" act and a violation of international law and Mexican sovereignty.
Barcena announced the ""immediate"" suspension of diplomatic ties with the South American nation shortly afterwards on X and added later that embassy staff would return to Mexico.
Ecuadorean authorities had sought permission from Mexico to enter the embassy to arrest Glas, who was sentenced to six years in prison in 2017 after he was found guilty of receiving bribes from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht in exchange for awarding it government contracts.
Glas, who has a preventive arrest warrant out on another corruption case, has complained that he is being persecuted for his political affiliation, which Ecuador's government denies.
Ecuadorean officials this week were angered by Lopez Obrador's comments on the South American country's bloody elections last year, in which a presidential candidate was assassinated.
Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa took office late last year and quickly faced an escalating conflict with drug gangs, which prompted him to declare a nationwide state of emergency early this year, which he extended last month.

3,US on high alert for Iran threat in region after Israeli strike in Syria,Iran said it reserves the right 'to take a decisive response',"The United States is on high alert and preparing for a possible attack by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Israel's strike on the Iranian embassy in Syria, a US official said on Friday.
""We're definitely at a high state of vigilance,"" the official said in confirming a CNN report that said an attack could come in the next week.
Suspected Israeli warplanes bombed Iran's embassy in Damascus on Monday in a strike that killed an Iranian military commander and marked a major escalation in Israel's war with its regional adversaries.
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has said that seven Iranian military advisers died in the strike, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in its Quds Force, which is an elite foreign espionage and paramilitary arm.
Iran said it reserves the right ""to take a decisive response.""
US President Joe Biden discussed the threat from Iran in a phone call on Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
""Our teams have been in regular and continuous contact since then. The United States fully supports the defence of Israel against threats from Iran,"" a senior Biden administration official said.

4,Maryam initiates merit-based appointment of law officers,Punjab govt downsizes number of law officers from 98 to 66 to safeguard public treasury,"In a departure from past practices, Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz has greenlit Advocate General Punjab Khalid Ishaq to appoint law officers solely on merit.
A committee has been formed to assess the performance of current law officers serving in the Advocate General Punjab's office. This committee is tasked with evaluating their effectiveness and competence.
The committee's deliberations will also extend to considering the appointment of new officers.
Reports suggest that the total strength of law officers in Punjab stood at 66, a number that was significantly increased to 97 by former chief minister of Punjab Pervez Elahi. This expansion aimed to accommodate a greater number of lawyers at the expense of public funds.
However, according to an official from the AG Punjab office, there was deemed no necessity for an expansion in the number of law officers. He has also revealed that around 180 employees were hired in the AG Punjab office during Elahi's tenure.
The Punjab government typically allocates approximately Rs1 million per law officer. Under the leadership of Maryam Nawaz, the government has once more downsized the total number of law officers from 98 to 66 to safeguard the public treasury.
The decision was made during a cabinet meeting.
A committee comprising senior provincial officials has been formed to assess the performance of current law officers, alongside the implementation of new regulations aimed at appointing law officers in the AG Punjab office based on merit.
A senior government official revealed to The Express Tribune that for the position of assistant advocate general, the lawyer must possess a minimum of 20 judgments, while those aspiring to become additional advocate generals must have at least 30 judgments.
It is pertinent to note that the Supreme Court has repeatedly urged both federal and provincial governments to prioritize merit-based appointments when selecting law officers.
Instances have been observed where the appointment process of law officers is influenced by the legal wings of political parties and various factions within the bar.
Interestingly, no clear criteria have been established for appointing law officers in the Advocate General's office of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
A lawyer disclosed that he turned down the opportunity to serve as Advocate General KP due to the PTI-led K-P government's apparent intention to prioritise members of the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) in appointments to the AG KP office.
The ILF, which is PTI's legal arm, was notably active in securing bail for PTI leaders following the violent incidents of May 9 last year.
Meanwhile, it was revealed that a majority of ILF members have been appointed as law officers, raising concerns of favouritism over merit in the government's selection process.
The lawyer further disclosed that K-P government officials are now reaching out to private counsels for legal opinions.

6,A lone Reacher no more!,Author Lee Child’s Jack Reacher is back and this time he has to avenge the death of one of his own.,"The tall, broad, and lonesome Jack Reacher is back, and this time he and his team of Special Investigators have a huge task at hand – solve the murder of one of their own. In the eight-episode second season of the series, the ex-military man-mountain is once again played by Alan Ritchson who makes the character his own, because not only does he fit the profile but also looks the part.
Unlike the first season where he has to first clear his name and then help his captors in solving his brother's murder, the crime in the second season is also close to Reacher’s heart and that’s why he doesn’t venture into the unknown alone. While it might seem a good idea to use Reacher’s friends to broaden the scope of the series, it does take away the spotlight from the big man, which might not please the ardent fans of the series.
However, Reacher Season 2 does end on a high and makes the viewers want more of the titular character. Where will life take the huge drifter, is only known to the producers, but until then the audience can watch him wreak havoc in any city and unleash his military training on those who believe they are above the law.

The plot
A couple of years after the events of the first season, Reacher (Alan Ritchson) is contacted by his investigator friend, the high-flying security consultant Frances Neagley (Maria Sten) who informs him about the suspicious death of one of their former colleagues. When more members of their 110th Special Investigations Unit are found missing in action, Reacher assembles his old team to track the MIAs, find the murderers, and avenge their friend.
Based on Lee Child’s 11th novel Bad Luck and Trouble, Season 2 reunites Reacher with Neagley who had also contacted forensic accountant Dixon (Serinda Swan), and smart aleck O’Donnell (Shaun Sipos) about the incident. When they find out that there is more to the death of their friend Calvin Franz, (Luke Bilyk), they change gear and add Saving America on their checklist as well.
On the sidelines, the reason why Special Investigators were a well-knit unit and why they were disbanded is disclosed, proving why they came together to find who hurt their friend. A cameo by one of season one’s main characters will also help in taking the story forward.
The good
The second season of Reacher continues from where he left off in the first, with a toothbrush as his sole possession. While the first season revolved around Reacher alone, the second one has ‘his friends’ added to the cast, giving it a grand look for a change. Alan Ritchson’s no-nonsense attitude makes Reacher stand out, whereas the bar brawls (for team-building), fist fights and airborne action just add weight to the entire season.
The unit has its work cut out for them throughout the eight episodes; on one hand they are dodging crooked cops while chasing a mysterious arms dealer referred to as A.M (Ferdinand Kingsley), on the other, they have an upright, honest, and intelligent NYPD detective Guy Russo (Domenick Lombardozzi) aiding them in their adventures.
The story moves at a fast pace, with everything happening in quick succession, be it the reunion of the Special Investigators, the death of one of their own or the occasional romantic endeavours of two of the former teammates. Alan Ritchson stands out as he successfully carries the weight of the entire season on his broad shoulders and leads the cast by example. While Maria Sten continues to impress with her acting prowess, it is Serina Swan and her sizzling chemistry with Reacher that keeps the audience hooked to the romantic angle.
The rest of the cast does a commendable job as well; however, veteran Robert Patrick’s entry remains the highlight of the season. It happened in the first episode when he makes his entry as the main antagonist, and asks the other person on phone about Sarah Connor which made me laugh out loud. For the uninitiated, Sarah Connor was the name of the character Robert Patrick’s futuristic robot T1000 was searching for (alongside her son John) in Terminator 2: Judgment Day more than three decades back. Smart, isn’t it?

The bad
Compared to the previous season, Reacher Season 2 leaves a lot to be desired. What began as a Reacher story turns into an NCIS-esque adventure where the team has to go undercover, break into a secured facility, and fight for each other, surrounded by each other and in the presence of each other. That might happen regularly on network television but Prime Video was above that, or we thought it was, until now.
While the action sequences are above anything you might have seen, the script lacks in the character development department, where every character has just one side – either good or bad. If a woman Marlo Burns (Christina Cox) is leading a tech organisation, she might have skeletons in her closet (she had tons of money, by the way!); if there is a Senator in the picture – Senator Lavoy (Noam Jenkins) – he shouldn’t be trusted; and a hitman is a hitman without any feelings.
The biggest flaw of the second season is the switching between two timelines, the present and the past. It would have made sense had one episode featured the flashback sequences but to insert it just to emphasise the bond between the team members was a distraction, especially for a miniseries. It may have looked cool when it happened for the first time in Arrow but back then, the origin story was tackled in the flashbacks and had a connection with the present, whereas here it is a waste of time.
Some of the dialogues seemed to have been inserted in the script so that they might look cool, which they weren’t. ‘Details matter’, ‘Did I ever tell you that you’re smart Neagley?’ and ‘You don’t mess with the Special Investigations Unit!’ were repeatedly said, and might have seemed great in a 24-episode series, but here they seemed awkward at worst. Same was the case with some action sequences where the bad guys seemed to be folks with low IQ, as they always wandered into the trap set by Reacher and Gang, and their demise reminded one of Wily E Coyote’s traps gone wrong in The Road Runner cartoons.
Last but not least, the way the shadowy figure of AM was presented and how he was disposed of (he was the bad guy, after all) showed that the writers were more interested in finishing up the series, than making it memorable. A man who could kill without opening his eyes, who was shrewd enough to escape a heavily-guarded airport and had plan B and C in his mind while going through the first one, could have given a tough time to the Reacher folks, had he lived a little longer.
And don’t get me started on the villain’s den where advanced missiles were being created; it seemed like a place from Rohit Shetty’s Bollywood flicks where the bad guys were waiting impatiently for the heroes to wreak havoc. Had this season been the first of the series, no one would have batted an eye had it been cancelled after the eight episodes!
The verdict
After weighing the pros and cons of the series, one can easily deduce that this season wasn’t at par with the first one. However, it gives the makers a chance to rethink their strategy and return with something better in the next season. One shouldn’t be thrilled if one or more characters from this season are part of the next one as well, besides Alan Ritchson of course.
The season could have been handled in a better manner too; instead of Lee Child’s 11th book in the Jack Reacher universe, they could have opted for an earlier one where the character was still in development phase. They could have kept the tone of the first season and experimented with narration style rather than taking the series into an altogether new direction.
The second season also suffers from the same issue that didn’t help the films either. On the big screen, Tom Cruise was a misfit for a character that was well-built, tall and unsocial; here the makers got carried away with the success of the first season and incorporated stuff that would have made even Lee Child angry. One hopes they consult the author before inserting their own ideas and focus on Reacher instead of Reacher and Gang. For the latter, they can always have a separate show on TV where the audience loves NCIS, CSI, Law and Order etc., but for Amazon Prime Video viewers, Reacher is enough.
