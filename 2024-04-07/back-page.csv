0,Gaza ceasefire talks set to begin in Cairo today,"Hamas reiterates demand for permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian enclave.","GAZA STRIP: American, Israeli and Hamas negotiators are expected in Cairo over the weekend in a renewed push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in a war that reaches the half-year mark on Sunday.
Egypt’s Al-Qahera News said CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani would join Egyptian mediators for Sunday’s indirect talks between the Israeli and Hamas delegations.
A Hamas delegation headed by the group’s deputy chief in Gaza, Khalil Al-Hayya, will go to Cairo on April 7 for the ceasefire talks, the group said in a statement on Saturday.
Hamas reiterated its demands issued in a March 14 proposal prior to a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that was passed on March 25.

Hamas reiterates demand for permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian enclave

The demands include a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, a return of the displaced, and a ‘serious’ exchange deal of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, the statement said.
The ceasefire attempt comes after Israel’s military made a rare admission of wrongdoing and said it was firing two officers over the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza where humanitarians say famine is imminent.
The admission did not quell calls for an independent probe, however.
 
 

The deaths of the workers from US-based World Central Kitchen (WCK) on April 1 led to a tense call between US President Joe Biden and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths decried Israel’s war against Hamas and called for a “collective determination that there be a reckoning for this betrayal of humanity”.
Ahead of the weekend talks, Biden wrote to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar urging them to secure commitments from Hamas to “agree to and abide by a deal”, a senior administration official told AFP.
Stop-start talks have made no headway since a week-long truce in November saw some hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel.
The White House confirmed negotiations would occur this weekend in Cairo.
Biden’s Thursday call with Netanyahu included discussions on “empowering his negotiators” to reach a deal, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.
Washington blames the lack of a deal on Hamas’s refusal to release sick and other vulnerable hostages. Qatar has said Israeli objections to the return of displaced Gazans are the main holdup.
Biden is under pressure over massive US military aid to Israel which, so far, Washington has not leveraged despite increasingly critical comments about Israel’s conduct of the war.
The Israeli military announced it was firing two officers after finding a series of errors led to the drone strikes that killed the WCK workers.
WCK said its Gaza operations remain suspended after the attack, while other global aid groups said relief work in the territory has become almost impossible.

1,Blast kills seven children in Syria,"Two others injured after ""explosive device"" goes off in Sanamayn city.","DAMASCUS: Seven children were killed in southern Syria’s Daraa province on Saturday when an “explosive device” detonated, state media reported.
“Seven children” were killed “and two other people were injured, one of them a woman, when an explosive device planted by terrorists” went off in the city of Sanamayn, state news agency SANA reported, quoting a police source.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor gave a different toll, saying that “eight children of different ages were killed and another was wounded” in the blast.
 
 

The Britain-based monitor said militias were accused of planting the device in order to target an unidentified person in the area.
Daraa was the cradle of the 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad’s rule but it was returned to government control in 2018 under a ceasefire deal backed by Russia. The province has since been plagued by killings, clashes and dire living conditions.
Syria’s war has killed more than 507,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country’s infrastructure and industry.

2,Taliban supreme leader wants good relations with all nations,"In a rare message ahead of Eid, Akhundzada urges Afghans to respect sharia.","KABUL: Afghanistan’s supreme leader on Saturday urged Afghans to respect sharia law and called for good relations with the international community, in a rare message marking the end of Ramazan.
In a written message ahead of Eidul Fitr, supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada said: “Injustice and being opposed to Sharia leads to insecurity.”
Since returning to power in August 2021, the Taliban authorities have enforced rules based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Women have borne the brunt of restrictions the United Nations has labelled “gender apartheid” that have pushed them from public life.
The Taliban government has not been officially recognised by any state and Hibatullah’s message did not touch on key diplomatic sticking points, such as allowing girls and women to return to secondary schools and universities.

In a rare message ahead of Eid, Akhundzada urges Afghans to respect sharia

Hibatullah, who lives in southern Kandahar province — the Taliban’s spiritual heartland — and is rarely seen in public, reiterated that the Taliban authorities “seek diplomatic and economic relations with all nations”.
 
 

“In the realm of international relations among all countries, we aim to pursue a balanced and economically focused policy in the light of the holy religion of Islam.”
The Eid message came after a recording attributed to Hibatullah that circulated in January was sha­red widely again in recent weeks.
In that audio clip, he vowed to implement punishments used under the Taliban’s previous rule from 1996 to 2001, such as public stoning of women for adultery, sparking condemnation from rights groups and the United Nations.
In a recent interview with Afghanistan’s Tolo News, Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said stoning was part of sharia law and that it would be used again “if the conditions for it arise”.
 
 

The Taliban authorities have not officially commented on the audio clip.
During the Taliban’s first rule, public executions were common, with only a handful carried out since their return to power.
Corporal punishment — mainly flogging — has been common, however, and employed for crimes including theft, adultery and alcohol consumption.
On Wednesday, five men and a woman were publicly flogged over charges of “adultery and sodomy” in eastern Logar province, the supreme court said in a statement.

3,Four states plan joint drills in South China Sea,"US, Australia, Japan and the Philippines vow to counter Beijing’s growing assertiveness.","MANILA: The United States, Australia, Japan and the Philippines will hold joint naval and air drills in the disputed South China Sea on Sunday, their defence chiefs said in a statement, as they deepen ties to counter China’s growing assertiveness in the region.
The exercise will take place in the disputed waterway — which Beijing claims almost entirely — days before US President Joe Biden is due to hold the first trilateral summit with the leaders of the Philippines and Japan.
“Our combined defense/armed forces will conduct a Maritime Cooperative Activity within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone on April 7, 2024,” they said in a joint statement on Saturday.
The drills named the “Maritime Cooperative Activity” will include naval and air force units from all four countries, the joint statement said.

US, Australia, Japan and Philippines vow to counter Beijing’s growing assertiveness

The four defence chiefs said they would “strengthen the interoperability of our… doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures”. There were no details on what the drills would precisely include.
The Japanese embassy in Manila said in a statement that “anti-submarine warfare training” would be included in the drills.
Earlier this week, Australian warship HMAS Warramunga arrived at the Philippine island of Palawan, which faces the hotly contested waters.
‘Peace and stability’
Top US officials have repeatedly declared the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to defending the Philippines against an armed attack in the South China Sea.
“These activities with our allies Australia, Japan, and the Philippines underscore our shared commitment to ensuring that all countries are free to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in the joint statement.
“Our operations together support peace and stability at the heart of our shared vision for a free and open region.”
Marcos issued a strongly worded statement on March 28, vowing the Philippines would not be “cowed into silence, submission, or subservience” by China.
Talks between the Philippines and Japan for a defence pact that would allow the countries to deploy troops on each other’s territory were “still ongoing”, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said.
