0,Economy suffers amid drop in private sector participation,The State Bank’s latest data shows the private sector has lost confidence in the banking system.,"KARACHI: Private sector participation in the economy is now lower than what it was in FY23, which saw a negative growth. 
The State Bank’s latest data shows the private sector has lost confidence in the banking system as it could hardly borrow Rs35 billion in the first nine months of FY 24. The amount for the same period in FY 23 was Rs264bn. 
Before last year’s negative economic growth, the private sector borrowed as much as Rs1,330bn in FY22. That year recorded a six per cent GDP growth. Since then political uncertainty has gripped the entire economy and created more uncertainties for business. 
The country was at the brink of sovereign default at the end of June last year, but was saved by the IMF’s $3bn Standby Arrangement. 
Revival ruled out 
Analysts rule out revival of the economy despite the inauguration of new governments at the centre and in the provinces. 
Another cause of low borrowing by the private sector was a record high interest rate. The State Bank has so far kept the policy rate unchanged at 22pc during the entire FY24. Trade and industry representatives have been calling for a 50pc rate cut to make the cost of doing business viable for both domestic as well as exportable products. 
Some analysts are confident that the State Bank will cut the interest rate by at least 200 basis points at the end of this month while some believe the rate will be cut by 100bps. 
According to analysts, inflation has been declining of late and was below the policy rate last month. However, the average for nine months still hovers around 27pc. 
Analysts believe rate cut is a must to help the private sector bounce back. 
At the same time, banks made windfall profits in the 2023 calendar year simply through investment in risk-free government papers. The massive government borrowing has changed the country’s banking scene as banks are now least interested in offering loans to the private sector. 
The new finance minister said recently that banks should start lending to the private sector to boost the economy. 
Conventional banks recorded net debt retirement of Rs57bn in the July-March period of the current fiscal year, against a net lending of Rs270bn in the same period of last year. 
Islamic banks were very active in FY23 as their lending during the first nine months was Rs432bn while it is just Rs57bn for the same period of FY24.  
The Islamic branches of conventional banks improved their performance with a net lending of Rs35bn against net debt retirement of Rs438bn in the same period of last fiscal year.

1,"Gold reaches all-time high of Rs245,100 per tola",Traders say investors are putting their money in bullion market to ensure future returns.,"KARACHI: Gold rates hit an all-time high of Rs245,100 per tola (24K) on Saturday, breaking the previous record of Rs 242,700 on Sept 2 last year.
A member of the All Sindh Saraf and Jewellers Association (ASSJA) said the gold rate rose by Rs4,900 per tola on the back of a $44 per ounce jump in the international market to $2,350 — yet another all-time high.
According to the association, domestic gold rates are adjusted by a premium of over $20 as against the prices in international market.
However, the rates issued by ASSJA are not followed by jewellers in Karachi. A trader said some gold dealers were offering a rate of Rs239,000-240,000 as buyers cannot further sustain the frequent price shocks.
He said that on Friday, the market in Dubai was lower than in Pakistan by Rs5,500 per tola, but on Saturday the two rates were almost equal.

Traders say investors are putting their money in bullion market to ensure future returns

Habibur Rahman, the chairman of Pakistan Gem Jewellers, Traders and Exporters Association (PGJTEA), said that “high gold prices, a low purchasing power and a deteriorating law and order situation have driven away buyers, especially during the last 10 days of Ramazan”.
He revealed that many shopkeepers had opted to keep their businesses closed after iftar this year. On the other hand, gold merchants used to keep their shops open for advance bookings and spot buying of jewellery for the post-Eid wedding season.
According to Mr Habib, the Gaza crisis and uncertainty over interest rate cut in June had combined to take the yellow metal prices to an all-time high.
He said many countries, including China, were piling up gold reserves while investors in Pakistan were putting their money in the bullion market to ensure future returns. He said the market was rife with speculations that investors would further shift towards gold as a safety net. If these speculations turn out to be true, the rate could climb to $3,000 in the international market upon fears that war is imminent.
A strengthening rupee against the dollar from Sept 5, 2023, to date has also helped in partially offsetting the impact of soaring world prices on the landed cost of goods. One dollar was trading at Rs307.10 on Sept 5 last year, as compared to the current rate of Rs277.91 in the interbank market. The rupee-dollar parity plays a vital role in determining local rates.
The chairman of All Pakistan Jewellers Manufacturers Association, Mohammad Arshad, said those investors who have procured gold at Rs240,000 per tola, are out to sell it and make some profit. It means they are not taking further risk for investment.
He said the local markets lack buyers even though a post-Eid wedding season is not far off. Buyers are perturbed over the rising prices of food items and utility bills, forcing them to purchase gold-related jewellery as per their requirement and cash limit.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), gold imports plunged to 263kg ($17 million) in the first seven months (July to January) of the current fiscal year from 342kg ($21m) a year ago.

2,Exports to US decline 10pc to $3.63bn,Shipments to China surge 42pc to $1.9bn in July-Feb FY24.,"ISLAMABAD: Pak­istan’s merchandise ex­­ports to the United States fell 10.14 per cent to $3.63 billion in the first eight months of the current fiscal year from $4.04bn over the corresponding period last year. 
The fall is mainly attributed to a dip in exports of textiles and clothing to North America, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan. 
Contrary to this, Pakistan’s exports to China increased by 42pc to $1.895bn in July-February FY24 from $1.334bn over the corresponding period last year. It is estimated that during FY24, Pakistan’s exports to China will reach $3bn by the end of June this year. 
According to PBS data, Pakistan’s exports to the US stood at $5.17bn in FY23, which fell by 23.28pc from $6.74bn over the previous fiscal year. In FY24, Pakistan’s exports to China stood at $2.22bn, dipped by 30pc from $3.18bn in FY22. 
According to PBS report, the US remained Pakis­tan’s biggest export destination in FY23. Shipments to the US decreased moderately, comprising 19pc of Pakistan’s overall exports in FY23, down from 21pc the previous year.  

Shipments to China surge 42pc to $1.9bn in July-Feb FY24

The share of exports to China declined from 10pc to 8pc in the year under review. Meanwhile, the export figures to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates remained relatively stable compared to the previous year.
These seven countries collectively accounted for 55pc of Pakistan’s total exports in FY23, a slight decrease from 57.3pc in the previous year. The decline was particularly notable in key core markets such as the US, China, and the UK. The primary factor hindering exports was the slowdown in major importing economies, which was exacerbated by stringent monetary policies responding to high inflation and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.
It said that home textile exports have dropped due to lower demand in the European Union, the US, and the UK. 
The fall in exports can be attributed to several key factors. These include a shortage of capital, which has hindered businesses’ ability to invest in their export operations. Additionally, there have been issues with refunds, such as delays in receiving sales tax refunds, deferred sales tax payments, and income tax refunds.
Imports from the US also dropped 17.36pc to $1.19bn during July-February from $1.44bn a year ago. In FY23, imports from the US also dipped 45.64pc to $2.18bn compared to $4.02bn in the same months last year.

3,Liberty Power confident its $125m bet on power sector will reap reward,The deal is among the biggest in recent times in Pakistan’s power sector.,"KARACHI: Liberty Power Holding, which this week signed a deal to buy the thermal energy assets of the country’s largest conglomerate for $125 million, is banking on its coal reserves and reforms laid out by the IMF for its investment to pay off.  
Liberty Power entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of conglomerate Engro Corp to buy all its thermal assets, including the country’s leading coal producer, Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company.
The deal is among the biggest in recent times in Pakistan’s power sector, which has remained in crisis for years due to unpaid debts and chronic technical issues. 
“We believe Thar Coal is the energy future of Pakistan, it’s indigenous, it’s cheap and it’s base load,” said Zain Mukaty, chief operating officer of Liberty Power, in an interview with Reuters on Friday, referring to coal deposits of the Thar desert.
The nation’s power sector has been plagued by high rates of power theft and distribution losses, resulting in accumulating debt across the production chain — a concern also raised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF’s policy suggestions under the current $3 billion standby credit arrangements with Pakistan have been a major confidence-boosting measure for Liberty Power.
“We feel that one of the primary prerogatives of the IMF (for the next programme) will be that circular debt needs to go from standstill towards reduction,” said Mr Mukaty, a 32-year-old Wharton graduate.
The decision to go into coal for Liberty stems from Pakistan’s foreign exchange crunch and its indigenous coal reserve potential.
“It seems like foreign exchange is going to remain a challenge in the near future and the medium-term future. By working on local coal you bypass any FX requirements you have,” said Mr Mukaty, adding that the government is talking to coal-powered power plants that work on imported coal, urging them to move to local coal.
“So, for us we see this as a long-term play. We don’t feel that domestic coal is a concept or an idea that’s going to go away,” he added.

4,FPCCI seeks broadening of tax base,"The tax and FBR reforms should not be done without consultation with relevant stakeholders, says FPPCI president.","KARACHI: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) said on Saturday that the desired tax-to-GDP ratio must be achieved by broadening the tax base and simplifying the taxation system rather than further squeezing the already taxed.
The only pragmatic approach to achieve a tax-to-GDP ratio of 15 per cent in the next five years is to add 1.5 to two million new taxpayers in the tax net, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh said in a statement.
The tax and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) reforms should not be done without consultation with relevant stakeholders, he said. 
Such efforts have been grossly unsuccessful in the past and the successive governments res­orted to regressive and anti-business steps of further increasing the taxes on existing filers, he added.

5,Seven wheat vessels berthed at Karachi Port,"KGTML cuts truck waiting time to save costs, boost efficiency.","ISLAMABAD: The Karachi Gateway Terminal Multipurpose Limited (KGTML) has informed the Ministry of Ports and Shipping that it has successfully achieved the berthing of seven wheat bulk-carrier vessels across berths 11-17 on the East Wharf of Karachi Port.
In a letter to the ministry, KGTML has stated that this achievement has been made possible through the introduction of efficient operational design, technological integration, and best practices leveraging Abu Dhabi Ports Group’s global experience.
It said that historically, cargo trucks had a waiting time of two-three days for ship to unload and cargo to be relayed to the right truck, increasing costs and time. However, KGTML has reduced this cost element to just one day.
KGTML launched its operations in February 2024 and informed the ministry that efficient handling is a result of modern operational design of the cargo yard, including a dedicated truck holding area, digitalisation of truck-in and truck-out times, labelling of trucks for accurate loading bay allocation, and installation of weighbridges to streamline end-to-end yard operations.

KGTML cuts truck waiting time to save costs, boost efficiency

It added that KGTML is now able to berth seven cargo ships without any traffic congestion at the terminal. 
KGTML is a joint venture between Abu Dhabi Ports Group, as a majority shareholder, and Kaheel Terminals, a UAE-based company, tasked with developing, operating, and managing the bulk and general cargo terminal berths 11-17 at Karachi Port’s East Wharf for 25 years. 
The letter to the ministry highlighted that KGTML aims to invest $75 million in the first two years, including upfront fees, prepayments, and investments in superstructure and equipment. 
This will be followed by an additional investment of $100m within five years, aimed at increasing efficiency and capacity by 75 per cent. These upgrades will enable the terminal to handle up to 14m tonnes per annum, up from the current capacity of 8m tonnes.
The company stated that highly efficient terminals comprise multiple components that must work together to provide a competitive edge to Pakistani importers and exporters. 
The efficient cargo handling operations will benefit the country’s rice, clinker, and cement exports, while on-site warehouses will assist wheat and fertiliser importers in reducing intermediary storage and logistics costs.

6,CCP recommends action against fertiliser firms,The inquiry was initiated in July 2022 after an exponential increase in urea prices.,"ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has recommended action against fertiliser manufacturers for alleged collusive pricing after it was revealed that they were making undue profits in violation of the law.
The inquiry against the Fertiliser Man­u­facturers of Pakis­tan Advisory Council (FMPAC) and its members was initiated in July 2022 after an exponential increase in urea prices.
The inquiry said that the decision by FMPAC and its members to increase the price by Rs48 from Rs1,720 to Rs1,768 per 50kg bag resulted in gains of Rs1.8 billion in the four-month period of Rabi season during that year.
The inquiry has recommended action against seven fertiliser manufacturers — including Fatima Fertiliser, Fatima Fert Ltd, Engro Fertilisers Ltd, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Agritech Ltd and Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Ltd — and FMPAC under Section 30 of the Competition Act, 2010.

7,Unexpected strawberry crop spins Burkina Faso’s ‘red gold’,"In season, strawberries tend to be sold at a higher price, fetching $5 per kilogram.","OUAGADOUGOU: In the suburbs of Burkina Faso’s capital Ouag­adougou, lucrative strawberry farming is supplanting traditional crops like cabbage and lettuce and has become a top export to neighbouring countries.
Prized as “red gold” in the Sahel, strawberry crops brought in some two billion CFA francs ($3.3 million) from 2019 to 2020, according to agricultural support programme PAPEA.
In their January to April season, strawberries “take the place of other crops”, Yiwendenda Tiemtore, a farmer in the working-class Boulmiougou district on the city outskirts, told AFP.
Tiemtore has been busy harvesting the red fruit since dawn, before temperatures rise to 40 degrees Celsius.
He harvests about 25 to 30 kilograms of Burkina’s popular strawberry varieties, “selva” and “camarosa”, every three days, watering his plots from wells.

In season, strawberries tend to be sold at a higher price, fetching $5 per kilogram

Cultivating strawberries, which thrive on ample sunlight and water, might come as a surprise in this semi-arid West African country. But Burkina Faso leads the region’s strawberry production, growing about 2,000 tonnes a year.
Despite being prized by local customers, more than half is exported to neighbouring countries.
“We receive orders from abroad, particularly from Ivory Coast, Niger and Ghana,” said market gardener Madi Compaore, who specialises in strawberries and trains local growers. “Demand is constantly rising and the prices are good.”
In season, strawberries tend to be sold at a higher price than other fruit and vegetables, fetching 3,000 CFA francs ($5) per kg.
Production has remained strong despite insecurity in the country, including from violence and the repercussions of two coups in 2022.
As well as in Ouagadougou, strawberry production is prominent in Bobo-Dioulasso -—- Burkina’s second city — even though “the sector’s not very well organised” there, Mr Compaore said.
Since the 70s
“You might think it’s an oddity to grow strawberries in a Sahelian country like Burkina Faso but it’s been a fixture since the 1970s,” Mr Compaore added.
The practice began when a French expatriate introduced a few plants to his garden in the country. Now more and more people are growing them.
“It’s our red gold. It’s one of the most profitable crops for both growers and sellers,” he explained.
Seller Jacqueline Taonsa has no hesitation in swapping from apples and bananas to strawberries in season.
“With the heat, it’s hard to keep strawberries fresh for long,” said Ms Taonsa, who cycles around Ouagadougou neighbourhoods balancing a salad bowl on her head.
“So, we take quantities that can be sold quickly during the day,” she explained. That usually amounts to about five of six kilogrammes.
Adissa Tiemtore used to be a full-time fruit and vegetable seller. She has mainly switched to selling woven loincloths now but takes up her strawberry business again in season because of the lucrative margins, as high as “200 to 300 per cent”.
“I start strawberry selling again when they’re in season to make a bit of money and satisfy my former customers, who continue to ask for them,” she said.
“We go round the different growers depending on what day they’re harvesting. That way we get enough to sell every day during the three fruit-producing months,” she said.
The end of April spells the end of the bonanza. “We go back to our other activities and we wait for next season,” Ms Tiemtore said.
