• Affirms Rajnath Singh’s remarks confirm Indian operatives conducted assassinations abroad
• Khawaja Asif says anti-Pakistan remarks by Indian leaders before polls aim to gain public support
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Saturday emphatically affirmed its unwavering commitment to saf­e­guard its sovereignty, hig­hlighting its proven capability to defend its territorial integrity against any external threats.
“Pakistan stands resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its sovereignty against any act of aggression, as demonstrated by its robust response to India’s reckless incursion in February 2019, which laid bare India’s hollow claims of military superiority,” the Foreign Office said in response to a statement by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh that seemed to be confirming that India conducted an assassinations campaign inside Pakistan.
Mr Singh in a TV interview said: “If any terrorist from a neighbouring country tries to disturb India or carry out terrorist activities here, he will be given a fitting reply. If he escapes to Pakistan we will go to Pakistan and kill him there.”
Mr Singh’s comments followed the publishing of an article by the British newspaper, The Guardian, on India conducting targeted killings on Pakistani territory.
Amid an election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi subtly referenced these extraterritorial operations in a speech, stating: “Today’s India goes inside enemy territory to strike.”
Mr Singh’s remarks constituted the first official confirmation by a senior Indian official that its intelligence operatives conducted assassinations abroad.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, echoing the position taken by the Foreign Office, warned India against any misadventure and said that in such a case a befitting response would be given.
The FO, while condemning Mr Singh’s statement, described it as “myopic and irresponsible”.
According to the statement, Delhi often engages in such rhetoric, deliberately stirring up extreme nationalistic fervour and unabashedly using this narrative for electoral gains.
India is currently in an election mode with polls barely two weeks away. Prime Minister Modi is seeking a third term in office.
Khawaja Asif also linked Indian leaders’ statements to the upcoming elections. “Anti-Pakistan statements are aimed at gaining public support,” he maintained.
The FO warned that such tactics not only undermine regional peace but also impede the prospects of constructive engagement in the long term.
The FO reminded that it had on Jan 25 provided “irrefutable evidence” of India’s campaign of extrajudicial and transnational assassinations on Pakis­tani soil.
“India’s assertion of its preparedness to extra-judicially execute more civilians, arbitrarily pronounced as ‘terrorists’, inside Pakistan constitutes a clear admission of culpability. It is imperative for the international community to hold India accountable for its heinous and illegal actions,” it maintained.
According to The Guardian report, the Indian government had killed about 20 people in Pakistan since 2020 as part of a broader plan to target “terrorists residing on foreign soil”.
Canada and the United States last year accused India of killing or attempting to kill people in those countries.

• Premier, CM Gandapur condemn targeting of police officials
DERA ISMAIL KHAN / LAKKI MARWAT: Six security personnel, including a DSP, were martyred and 12 militants killed in separate incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan on Friday night and Saturday.
In one incident, eight militants were killed in a gun battle with security forces during an intelligence-based operation conducted in the Kot Sultan area of Kulachi tehsil, Dera Ismail Khan district, on Friday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Saturday.
It said security forces conducted the operation on the reported presence of militants in Kot Sultan. The militants had remained actively invo­lved in numerous activities against security forces and targeted killing of civilians, it added.
The security forces recovered wea­p­ons, ammunition and explosives from the dead militants, the ISPR said.
Meanwhile, two suspected militants were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in North Waziristan district on Saturday. The ISPR said the security forces carried out an operation in the district where the forces effectively engaged the militants’ location and killed two of them in the gun battle.
Three cops martyred
In Lakki Marwat, a DSP and two cops were martyred and a constable was injured by armed miscreants in two incidents on Friday night, officials said.
They said DSP Gul Muhammad, along with other policemen, had set up a temporary checkpoint on the busy Peshawar-Karachi highway as part of the police’s plan to ensure safety of roads and highways before Eidul Fitr. Upon their return from the checkpoint, armed men opened fire on the police van near Manjiwala Chowk, leaving the DSP and Constable Naseem Gul dead. Constable Farooq Khan was wounded.
The deceased and injured cops were shifted to the Tehsil Hea­dquarters Hospital in the Serai Naurang town, where Constable Farooq was referred to a hospital in Peshawar due to his critical injuries.
In the second attack the same night, Constable Sanamat Khan was martyred when unknown assailants opened fire on him near his house in the Sra Darga area.
The cop was stationed in Miramshah town of North Waziristan district, and he had returned to the village on leave.
Funeral prayers for the martyred were held on Saturday.
 






PM Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attack on policemen in Lakki Marwat. He said KP police had been acting like a bulwark against terrorism and the “cowardly terrorist activities” could not shake their determination.
 






KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also denounced the militant attacks and directed the police authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice without delay.
IED blast
Moreover, a police official was martyred and another injured when a remote-controlled improvised explosive device went off in Mamund tehsil of Bajaur district on Saturday.
Residents and police officials said the explosion occurred near a police post in the Barkholozo area just before iftar, adding that Assistant Sub-Inspector Bakhat Zada was martyred on the spot while Constable Ihsanullah wounded.
CTD man killed
A head constable of the CTD was killed by unknown people near the Mian Lal police post in the Tank district on Saturday night.
 
 

DPO Abdul Salam Khalid said assailants opened fire on the CTD official, Zahir Shah, martyring him on the spot.
Panjgur gun battle
Two suspected militants belonging to a banned outfit were killed in a gun battle with security forces in an intelligence-based operation conducted by security forces in Panjgur district of Balochistan on Saturday. The ISPR said the operation was conducted on information about the presence of militants between the night of April 5 and 6.
It identified the militants as Asad and Hasrat, adding that a cache of arms, ammunition and explosives was also recovered.
 






Levies man martyred
Separately, a Levies official was martyred in a landmine explosion in a wheat field in the Dera Bugti district, police said.
Muhammad Hussain was threshing wheat on his agricultural land in the Juri area when he stepped on the landmine and was injured in the ensuing blast.
He was rushed to the district hospital in Dera Bugti but succumbed to his injuries.
“The landmine was planted in the wheat field by unknown people,” the police said, adding that an investigation into the incident was underway.

2,Gohar rules out PTI-SIC merger,ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Saturday ruled out the possibility...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Saturday ruled out the possibility of his party’s merger with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) in future, stating that the two parties were functioning with different orientations.
“If they (SIC) call for a merger, then their party can do it, but since it is a re­ligious party maybe they might not go for a me­rger; we are a different kind of democratic party so we will keep our platform,” said the PTI leader while speaking at DawnNews show Doosra Rukh.
The PTI leader was questioned about the possible merger with the SIC in case the PTI got back its election symbol ‘bat’ from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Mr Khan said the PTI had been waiting for a decision by the ECP to recognise and notify the intra-party elections which were held on March 3, after which they would be able to get the election symbol back.
“It’s been one month and we still haven’t been given the certificate,” he said, adding that it was very “unfortunate”.
The PTI chairman said it was “obvious” that if the party was given its certificate and election symbol then its members, currently part of the SIC, would return to the party, adding that these aspects were part of the memorandum of understanding with the SIC as well.
“We will join our party when we receive the certificate and will participate in parliament from its platform,” the PTI leader said.
Barrister Gohar added the PTI had a “very good understanding” with the SIC and both parties would continue to be represented in parliament.
Barrister Gohar also downplayed the matter of a recent meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet at the Peshawar Corps Commander’s House, saying it was not a major issue if the cabinet met there for some reasons.
He stressed that a “working relationship” needed to be maintained and pointed towards the security climate of the province.
He said PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan did not talk to him about the cabinet meeting controversy.

3,Five officials face action for Bisham negligence,LAHORE: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif has ordered action against five senior police officers over negligence and...,"LAHORE: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif has ordered action against five senior police officers over negligence and security lapse, which led to the Bisham terror attack in which five Chinese engin­eers were killed last week.
While addressing a press conference on Satur­day, Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the action has been ordered against the police chiefs of Hazara division, Upper Kohistan and Lower Kohistan districts; Dasu Hydropower Project security director; and the commandant of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Special Security Unit.
Mr Tarar added that PM Shehbaz visited the Chin­ese embassy and met the ambassador after the attack.
The PM also went to Dasu and met Chin­ese engineers working on the hydropower project to boost their morale and give a message that Pakistan holds its friendship with China in high regard, the minister added.
A committee was formed for an inquiry into the attack, Mr Tarar said, adding that since the attack, the premier also held several meetings on the security of Chinese workers.
“Mr Sharif is personally supervising the matter of security for Chinese projects, and an effective system is being developed.”
The armed forces and law enforcement agencies were determined to root out terrorism and “would not allow anybody to harm the country’s peace”.
Foolproof security for Chinese
Separately, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has also directed the officials to ensure foolproof security for Chinese citizens in Pakistan.
While presiding over a meeting on security arrangements for Chinese citizens residing in Pakistan, the minister said SOPs must be followed when it comes to the protection of foreigners in general and Chinese in particular.
“The enemies of the state do not want Pakistan to prosper, but they are mistaken. We will not let them achieve their nefarious designs.”
During the meeting, Mr Naqvi called the protection of foreigners, especially Chinese citizens, a “top priority” and condemned the intentions of “nefarious elements seeking to disrupt the development and prosperity of Pakistan”.
He affirmed that the government would not allow such malicious agenda to succeed.
The meeting was also given a comprehensive briefing on the existing measures in place to protect foreigners.
The meeting took place a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to personally review monthly meetings on the overall security of the country, particularly that of Chinese citizens working on development projects.
Since the Bisham attack, several high-level meetings have been held to ensure the security of Chinese workers in Pakistan.

4,‘Some party leaders’ talking to establishment: Imran,"Former PM says will talk to anyone for Pakistan; claims efforts on to ""dismantle"" PTI.","ISLAMABAD: After his party faced pressure in the form of arrests and dese­rtions in the wake of the May 9 viol­ence, former prime minister Imran Khan on Saturday revealed that some PTI leaders were still in contact with the establishment.
Speaking to reporters at Adiala Jail after the hearing of the Al-Qadir Trust case, Mr Khan implied he was ready to hold a dialogue with anyone for the sake of the country.
The PTI founder said if he could hold talks with former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, who he later accused of being instrumental in the fall of the PTI government in April 2022, then he could meet anyone, since the country was passing through a difficult phase.
Mr Khan said that a few leaders in the PTI “are still in contact with the establishment”, apparently for negotiations. However, he did not elaborate.

Former PM says will talk to anyone for Pakistan; claims efforts on to ‘dismantle’ PTI

He claimed that the mandate of the PTI had been stolen and “efforts were being made to take over the party”.
Mr Khan said his spouse Bushra Bibi was being allegedly targeted to exert pre­ssure on him and added that those pointing fingers at her were doing so in a bid to ‘dismantle’ the party.
 
 

Mr Khan said he had never entered into a confrontation with the military and alluded to his ties with the ex-COAS, despite his government’s ouster. He claimed that the ex-army chief ‘backstabbed’ him, adding he could have de-notified him but he exercised restraint.
Mr Khan had turned on former Gen Bajwa around the time of his ouster, and claimed that the latter was involved in a US-backed conspiracy to remove him from office.
In his media talk on Saturday, the former PM claimed that he had also relayed a message to Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir through former president Arif Alvi that he knew about the so-called ‘London Plan’.
Imran Khan alleged that police entered his bedroom on Aug 5 last year to detain him, and confiscated his passport and the cheque book, adding that Bushra Bibi had moved her valuables to a secure location. The ex-PM alleged that intelligence agencies had asked his staffers to turn ‘approver’ against him.
According to the ex-premier, the country was facing a 1970s-like situation.
About the incumbent government, Mr Khan claimed that the “king is sitting behind and [interior minister] Mohsin Naqvi is at the forefront as his viceroy”. Mr Khan claimed that Shehbaz Sharif had no authority.
Meanwhile, the accountability court continued recording of testimony of the witnesses, as five prosecution witnesses had been cross-examined by the defence counsel on Saturday. The case will resume after Eid holidays.
