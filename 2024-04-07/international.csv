0,Mexico cuts ties with Ecuador after embassy storming in Quito,Images showed police special forces massed outside the embassy and at least one of them scaling its walls.,"QUITO: Ecuadoran authorities stormed the Mexican embassy in Quito on Friday to arrest former vice president Jorge Glas, who had been granted political asylum there, prompting Mexico to sever diplomatic ties after the  “violation of international law”.
Images showed police special forces massed outside the embassy and at least one of them scaling its walls, which were already surrounded by police and military. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said authorities  “forcibly entered” the building to arrest Glas.
“This is a flagrant violation of international law and the sovereignty of Mexico,” he said on social media platform X.
Foreign minister Alicia Barcena said the arrest was a  “flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations” and Mexican personnel in the embassy had been injured during the incident.
“Mexico announces the immediate breaking of diplomatic relations with Ecuador,” she said on X. She added that Mexican diplomatic personnel will immediately leave the South American country and asked Quito to  “offer the necessary guarantees” for their movement.
Mexico had complained earlier in the day of  “harassment” due to an increased police presence outside its Quito embassy. The former Ecuadoran vice president — who served under leftist President Rafael Correa — sought refuge in the Mexican embassy last December after authorities issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged corruption.

1,Thousands join protest against Hungarian PM,BUDAPEST: Tens of thousands rallied in Budapest on Saturday in support of a former government insider turned critic...,"BUDAPEST: Tens of thousands rallied in Budapest on Saturday in support of a former government insider turned critic of premier Viktor Orban, as he outlined his plans to try to challenge the nationalist leader.
The protest against Orban’s government was called by lawyer and former insider Peter Magyar, who has been shaking up Hungarian politics since he shot into prominence in the wake of a child abuse pardon scandal.
About 100,000 people gathered at Budapest’s Kossuth Square in front of the parliament, with many carrying national flags and holding up signs that read  “Hungarians rise!”  “We will take back our country step by step, and brick by brick we will build a sovereign, modern Hungary,” Magyar told a cheering crowd.
He said he would soon announce the creation of a new political party to run in European and local elections in June.
Magyar, 43, is the ex-husband of Orban’s former justice minister Judit Varga and has long been in the orbit of the ruling Fidesz party until he parted ways, vowing to challenge Orban’s  “power factory” by forming a new political party. 
Varga was forced to stand down from public life over the pardon scandal and Magyar has since emerged as a fierce Orban critic.
Last month, Magyar released a recording allegedly implicating a top minister in a high-profile corruption case, and called for the chief prosecutor to resign.

2,Greta Thunberg held twice after Dutch protest,The climate activist joined hundreds of protesters on a walk from The Hague’s city centre to the nearby A12 arterial highway.,"THE HAGUE: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was detained twice by Dutch police on Saturday after she and a group of marchers blocked a main road in The Hague to protest against fossil fuel subsidies.
Earlier, Thunberg joined hundreds of protesters on a walk from The Hague’s city centre to the nearby A12 arterial highway that connects the seat of the Dutch government with other cities including Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht.
The march was organised by the Extinction Rebellion environmental group (XR) — who previously swarmed the highway and blocked off traffic for hours before being sprayed by a police water canon and taken away.
On Saturday, dozens of police officers, including some on horseback, blocked the group from accessing the motorway, warning that  “violence could be used” should the marchers try to get onto the road.
Carrying XR flags and placards saying  “Stop fuel subsidies now!” and  “The planet is dying!”, chanting protesters were then locked in a tense standoff with police who formed a wall of law enforcement. Thunberg joined in with the chants and slogans during the protest. “It’s important to demonstrate today because we are living in a state of planetary emergency,” Thunberg said as police blocked marchers. “We must do everything to avoid that crisis and to save human lives,” she said.
‘Here for climate’
Some activists, however, found another route and blocked a main road close to the highway where they — including Thunberg — sat down on the tarmac. Asked whether she was concerned about police action and arrest, Thunberg said:  “Why should I be?” But shortly afterwards, Thunberg herself was arrested and dragged away by police to a waiting touring bus where she was detained with other activists.
She told the ANP national news agency by telephone that her arrest had proceeded  “calmly”. “It’s not about the arrest. I am here for the climate,” she said.
A spokesman for the Public Prosecutor’s Office later confirmed the protesters were briefly detained before being released at a different location. Shortly afterwards, however, Thunberg and some activists returned and were arrested again, this time for blocking a nearby traffic intersection, and led away to a waiting police van.
Prosecutor spokesman Vincent Veenman said that currently no charges have been laid against the activists. “This however may change if people are arrested over and over again for the same offence,” Veenman said.

3,Russian strikes on Kharkiv kill seven,KYIV: A series of Russian attacks on Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv killed seven people and wounded a dozen ...,"KYIV: A series of Russian attacks on Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv killed seven people and wounded a dozen more, Kyiv said on Saturday.
The northeastern city, 30 kilometres from the Russian border, has seen increased deadly attacks in recent months, more than two years into Moscow’s invasion. An overnight attack killed six people; while another person died in a separate strike on Saturday, authorities said.
“Six killed and 11 wounded as a result of the enemy’s night-time missile attack on Kharkiv,” the local prosecutor’s office said on social media. Authorities said the strike hit just after midnight.
“At about 12:20am, the Russian armed forces launched missile attacks on the residential Shevchenkivskyi district of Kharkiv,” the prosecutor’s office said. “High-rise buildings, administrative buildings, dormitories, a kindergarten, shops, cafes and cars were damaged.” 
Kharkiv police said Russian forces fired two S-300 missiles at the city and then attacked with drones during rescue operations. “At night, the Russians attacked Kharkiv with S-300. On a city that is sleeping,” Volodymyr Tymoshko of the local police force said on social media. He said Russia then used  “the practice of repeated shelling”. “When all relevant services were working at the site of the missile hit, enemy drones arrived,” he said, adding that air defence downed them. 
Another strike on the Shevchenkivskyi district on Saturday caused damaged to civilian infrastructure and set a car on fire. “According to preliminary data, one person died, another was wounded,” Oleg Sinegubov, head of the Kharkiv regional state administration, said.
‘Russian terror’
Local officials earlier said that the six dead were killed by the drones. Kharkiv mayor Igor Terekhov said Russia attacked  “while Kharkiv residents were sleeping peacefully”. He said  “nine residential buildings” were damaged as well as  “two kindergartens, two schools” and  “several dozen shops”.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the  “Russian terror against Kharkiv” and called for increased Western air defence deliveries to protect the northeastern region.
The Russian army said it had destroyed two anti-aircraft systems in Kharkiv.
Ukrainian police said there was a separate attack on Mala Danylivka, a village on Kharkiv’s northwest outskirts, which did not result in casualties. Photos released by police on Telegram showed several fires in civilian areas, including near a high-rise apartment building.
The attacks came as Ukraine’s airforce reported multiple groups of Russian drones across the country.
In the southern Kherson region, authorities on Saturday said they recovered the bodies of a couple in their 50s and 60s killed by a Russian missile attack a day earlier.
“Yesterday, the occupiers attacked the village of Zmiivka in Beryslav district with guided missiles. “A building was damaged as a result of the hit,” said Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson region. “Under the rubble, rescuers found the bodies of two victims — a man born in 1957 and a woman born in 1965,” he added.
The attacks on Kharkiv came a day after a Russian strike on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia killed four people and wounded more than 20. Ukraine’s interior ministry on Saturday updated the wounded toll in the Zaporizhzhia strike to 23, which included two children.

4,Prospects of once-in-a-lifetime event in space excite astronomers,An astronomer at Arizona State University said he was very excited to see the nova’s “outburst”.,"PARIS: Sometime between now and September, a massive explosion 3,000 light years from Earth will flare up in the night sky, giving amateur astronomers a once-in-a-lifetime chance to witness this space oddity.
The binary star system in the constellation Corona Borealis —  “northern crown” — is normally too dim to see with the naked eye. But every 80 years or so, exchanges between its two stars, which are locked in a deadly embrace, spark a runaway nuclear explosion.
The light from the blast travels through the cosmos and makes it appear as if a new star — as bright as the North Star, according to Nasa — has suddenly just popped up in our night sky for a few days.
It will be at least the third time that humans have witnessed this event, which was first discovered by Irish polymath John Birmingham in 1866, then reappeared in 1946.
The appropriately named Sumner Starrfield, an astronomer at Arizona State University, said he was very excited to see the nova’s  “outburst”. After all, he has worked on T Coronae Borealis — also known as the  “Blaze Star” — on and off since the 1960s.
Starrfield is currently rushing to finish a scientific paper predicting what astronomers will find out about the recurring nova whenever it shows up in the next five months. “I could be today... but I hope it’s not,” he said with a laugh.
The white dwarf and red giant
There are only around 10 recurring novas in the Milky Way and surrounding galaxies, Starrfield explained. Normal novas explode  “maybe every 100,000 years,” he said. But recurrent novas repeat their outbursts on a human timeline because of a peculiar relationship between their two stars.
One is a cool dying star called a red giant, which has burnt through its hydrogen and has hugely expanded — a fate that is awaiting our own Sun in around five billion years.
The other is a white dwarf, a later stage in the death of a star, after all the atmosphere has blown away and only the incredibly dense core remains. Their size disparity is so huge that it takes T Coronae Borealis’s white dwarf 227 days to orbit its red giant, Starrfield said. The two are so close that matter being ejected by the red giant collects near the surface of the white dwarf.
Once the mass roughly of Earth has built up on the white dwarf — which takes around 80 years — it heats up enough to kickstart a runaway thermonuclear reaction, Starrfield said.
This ends up in a  “big explosion and within a few seconds the temperature goes up 100-200 million degrees” Celsius, said Joachim Krautter, a retired German astronomer who has studied the nova.
The James Webb space telescope will be just one of the many eyes that turn towards the outburst of T Coronae Borealis once it begins, Krautter said. But you do not need such advanced technology to witness this rare event — whenever it may happen.
“You simply have to go out and look in the direction of the Corona Borealis,” Krautter said.
Some lucky sky gazers are already preparing for the year’s biggest astronomic event on Monday, when a rare total solar eclipse will occur across a strip of the United States.

5,"US, Russian, Belarus ISS colleagues return to Earth","Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky and the first ever Belarusian cosmonaut, Marina Vassilevskaya, “spent 14 days in orbit”.","MOSCOW: A Nasa astronaut, a Russian cosmonaut and Belarus’s first ever space traveller on Saturday returned to Earth safely after a fortnight aboard the International Space Station, Russia’s Roscosmos agency reported.
“Today, at 10:17am Moscow time (0717 GMT), the descent vehicle of Sozuz MS-24 manned spacecraft landed near the Kazakh city of Zhezkazgan,” Roscosmos reported. “The (vessel’s) deorbit and its descent to Earth went off normally,” the agency added.
Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky and the first ever Belarusian cosmonaut, Marina Vassilevskaya,  “spent 14 days in orbit”, while American astronaut Loral O’Hara completed a 204-day mission. For Vassilevskaya and O’Hara it was their first ever stint on the ISS.
In a statement, Belarus President Alex­ander Lukashenko congratulated the crew for the safe return from their mission.
The spacecraft took off from the Baikonur space port in Kazakhstan on March 23 after a two-day delay following a hitch in pre-launch preparations — a temporary but high-profile setback for Russia’s space programme that has been hit by financial problems, scandal, corruption and failure. One recent setback was the loss of the robotic Luna-25 spacecraft in a crash on the Moon last August.
Russian-Western space cooperation has been hit by Russia’s assault on Ukraine, which began in February 2022, and the international sanctions that followed.

6,Indian academic gets bail after six years without trial,"Shoma Sen, 66, a former professor of English at Nagpur University, was arrested in 2018.","NEW DELHI: An Indian academic detained for almost six years without trial has been granted bail by the Supreme Court, highlighting the country’s use of harsh anti-terror laws decried by rights activists. 
Shoma Sen, 66, a former professor of English at Nagpur University, was arrested in 2018. 
She was one of 16 activists and academics held for allegedly inciting violence between different Indian caste groups, among them a Jesuit priest, Stan Swamy, who died in pre-trial detention three years later at the age of 84. 
The National Investi­gation Agency (NIA), the country’s top anti-terror agency, also claimed that Sen and some of the other activists had links with far-left Maoist insurgents. 
New Delhi has been battling armed Maoist rebels, known locally as Naxals, for decades in dense, tribal-dominated forests of central and eastern India. “At present, the appellant has been in detention for almost six years, her age is over 66 years and charges have not yet been framed,” the two-judge bench said on Friday. 
“If we examine the acts attributed to the appellant by the various witnesses or as inferred from the evidence... we do not find prima facie commission or attempt to commit any terrorist act” by Sen, the court added. Another sexagenarian activist detained in the same case, Sudha Bharadwaj, was released by the Mumbai High Court in 2021. 
Sen, like Bharadwaj and Swamy, was held under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which allows indefinite detention without trial. 
Critics say the law — which makes it difficult for accused people to receive bail — has been used by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to silence dissent.

The recovery of Elad Katzir’s body brings to 12 the number of prisoners which the army says it has brought home from Gaza. But it gave no comfort to his sister, who blamed Israeli authorities for his death.
The Israeli army said in a statement that  “the body of the abductee Elad Katzir, who according to intelligence was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad, was rescued overnight from Khan Yunis and returned to Israeli territory”.

8,Nancy Pelosi urges Biden to stop sale of US weapons to Israel,"The representative sign letter from dozens of congressional Democrats, which also calls for probe into aid workers' killings.","WASHINGTON: Repre­sen­­tative Nancy Pelosi, former House speaker and a key ally of Joe Biden, signed a letter on Friday from dozens of congressional Democrats to the president and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging a halt to weapons transfers to Israel.
Support from Pelosi, a veteran member of Biden’s Democratic Party, for stopping the transfer of weapons to Israel showed that the view is increasingly becoming mainstream in the party.
Key quote
Friday’s letter called on the Biden administration to conduct its own probe into an Israeli airstrike that killed seven staff of the aid group World Central Kitchen on Monday.
“In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers,” the letter said. It was signed by Pelosi and 36 other Democrats including Representatives Barbara Lee, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Context
The Israeli military said it dismissed two officers and formally reprimanded senior commanders after an inquiry into the aid workers’ deaths found serious errors and breaches of procedure. Biden held a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday in which he said Israel needed to do more to protect civilians or the US would change its policy.

9,Gaza’s largest hospital an ‘empty shell’ with human graves: WHO,WHO chief says the team had seen “at least five dead bodies during the mission”.,"GENEVA: The World Health Organisation said on Saturday that Gaza’s largest hospital had been reduced to ashes by Israel’s latest siege, leaving an  “empty shell” with many bodies.
Israeli forces pulled out of Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Monday after a two-week military operation, during which it said it had battled Palestinian militants inside what was once the Palestinian territory’s most important medical complex.
A WHO-led mission finally accessed the hospital on Friday, after multiple failed attempts since March 25, the UN health agency said, describing the massive destruction.
“WHO and partners managed to reach Al Shifa — once the backbone of the health system in Gaza, which is now an empty shell with human graves after the latest siege,” agency chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
He said the team had seen  “at least five dead bodies during the mission”. They had also found that  “most of the buildings in the hospital complex are extensively destroyed and the majority of assets damaged or reduced to ashes”, the WHO chief said.
“Even restoring minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible,” he said, adding that  “an in-depth assessment by a team of engineers is needed to determine if the remaining buildings are safe for future use”.
Tedros lamented that efforts by WHO and other aid groups to revive basic services at Al Shifa after Israel’s first devastating raid on the hospital last year  “are now lost, and people are once again deprived of access to lifesaving health care services”.
Of Gaza’s 36 main hospitals, only 10 remain partially functional, according to WHO.Tedros said urgent action was needed in Gaza as  “famine looms, disease outbreaks spread and trauma injuries increase”.
He called for the  “protection of remaining health facilities in Gaza (and) protection of health and humanitarian workers”.
