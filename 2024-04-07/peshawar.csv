0,11 election candidates challenge ‘defeat’ in Peshawar tribunals,Independents backed by PTI claim their Forms-45 were tampered with.,"PESHAWAR: Eleven candidates for the Feb 8 general elections have moved the election tribunals here, challenging their electoral defeats.
Of the petitioners, 10 were independent candidates belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and one was a nominee of the Awami National Party.
Nine of the independents belong to Peshawar. They include former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra (PK-79) and Kamran Khan Bangash (PK-82), former deputy speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Mahmood Jan (PK-72), former MNAs Sajid Nawaz Khan (NA-28) and Hamidul Haq (PK-80), former MPA Arbab Jehandad Khan (PK-74), former Peshawar district nazim Mohammad Asim (PK-78), and lawyers Ali Zaman (PK-73) and Malik Shahab (PK-75). One independent candidate (PK-95), Imran Khan, is from Kurram district.
ANP leader and former provincial minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain has also challenged his election defeat in Nowshera’s PK-89 constituency.

Independents backed by PTI claim their Forms-45 were tampered with

The Election Commission of Pakistan has notified two tribunals for Peshawar, comprising Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Wiqar Ahmad.
The PTI leaders filed their election petitions through advocates Shumail Ahmad Butt, Ali Gohar Durrani, and Ali Azim Afridi.
In petitions, they insisted that following unprecedented and massive pre-poll rigging in various modes and forms, the general elections were held in their areas on Feb 8, 2024.
They added that after the polling time ended, the polled votes were counted, and duly-signed Forms 45 containing election results at a polling station were given away to their polling agents.
The petitioners claimed that those forms showed them election winners, but the relevant returning officers manipulated those results and declared their rivals returned candidates in Forms-47 issued later.
They added that Section 92 of the Election Act, which required candidates or their polling agents to be present during results compilation for provisional consolidation before the issuance of Form 47, was also violated.
The petitioners claimed that they were “on top” according to Forms 45 issued in their respective constituencies.
They claimed that following the issuance of Forms-45, they went to returning officers for the provisional consolidation of poll results, but they or their polling agents were denied entry to the premises from 9pm to 6am.
The petitioners said they were informed about their victory in the morning, but the votes polled by them were reduced, and other candidates were declared winners.
Former finance minister Taimur Saleem Khan claimed that the Form 45 vote count clearly showed him receiving 25,114 votes, with the runner-up candidate, Attaul Haq, having secured 5,188 votes and Jalal Khan standing fifth on the list, securing 1,619 votes.
He said he complied his poll results in tabular form on the basis of Form 45, which he received from the presiding officers by his polling agents.
Mr Taimur said in the morning, a bogus and manufactured Form 47 was issued, declaring that Jalal Khan, who was at No. 5, had won by getting 16,031 votes, whereas his [petitioner’s] votes were declared 11,495.
He said the manipulated Form 47 was officially not handed over to him, and he learned about it from the website of the ECP.
All petitioners claim that Forms-45 were massively tampered with in their respective constituencies. They added that the forgery was so clear that even with the naked eye, it was visible.
Meanwhile, ANP candidate Mian Iftikhar Hussain, a candidate in PK-89 Nowshera, alleged that massive rigging took place in his constituency in favour of the PTI-backed independent candidate, resulting in his defeat.

1,Strike ends as labourers allowed work at Torkham,KHYBER: The protesting labourers and daily wagers ended their three-week-long protest sit-in on Saturday after the...,"KHYBER: The protesting labourers and daily wagers ended their three-week-long protest sit-in on Saturday after the Pakistani and Afghan officials agreed to provide them access up to the Torkham border’s zero point and also to resume their small-time cross-border trade.
Fehmeedullah Shinwari, a leader of protesting workers, told Dawn that their protest sit-in bore fruits when officials from both the countries accepted their demand to resume limited cross-border trade. He said those having been issued temporary identity cards by the Pakistani authorities were also given access up to the zero point.
He said of the 700 labourers and daily wagers, about 300 were already in possession of passports and visas, while the rest were issued temporary cards for their movement up to the zero point.
Mr Shinwari said the ban on their movement and the harsh attitude of the Afghan Taliban authorities had seriously affected their cross-border movement and small-time businesses, forcing them to protest.
He said the fresh agreement would benefit his community as they had resumed their jobs to earn a living for their impoverished families.
Meanwhile, the district administration issued fresh data of the registered Afghan families living in Landi Kotal.
Officials said they had so far registered 3,000 Afghan nationals, including children and women, and those who were in possession of Afghan Citizen Cards.
They said registration teams had been constituted to collect relevant data and register all the Afghans living in the region.
The officials said all the remaining Afghans living in Landi Kotal and Torkham had also been directed to register themselves at the office of the assistant commissioner prior to April 15 as no Afghan would be registered thereafter.
The officials said the registration process was part of the Phase-II of the federal government’s plan to expel all illegally-staying aliens from its soil after the April 15 deadline.

3,Hospitals in Peshawar record low patient arrivals ahead of Eid,Medics insist people avoid visits due to fasting.,"PESHAWAR: As Eidul Fitr is just around the corner, more and more in-patients are leaving hospitals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to celebrate the post-Ramazan festival with families, insist doctors.
“Normally, our wards overflow with patients, but they’ve got a lot of space ahead of Eid as patients admitted for treatment are going home to join Eid celebrations at home,” a senior physician at a medical teaching institution told Dawn.
He also said most patients requiring surgeries for kidney, gallstone, and tonsillitis didn’t visit doctors in Ramazan due to fasting and postponed medical procedures until after Eidul Fitr.
“This pre-Eid attitude of patients has upset our [hospitals’] routine. Patient arrivals will go up soon after Ramazan is over. However, this will make hospital visitors wait longer for operations,” he said.

Medics insist people avoid visits due to fasting

The physician said hospital staff members usually sat idle in the eye, ENT, and skin outpatient departments as well as in wards in the run up to Eidul Fitr as patients didn’t show up.
Doctors at a district headquarters hospital told Dawn that public sector healthcare centres across the province, including Peshawar, wore a “deserted look” during Ramazan as patients postponed checkups and treatments until after Eid due to fasting.
They said their hospital had 500 beds, but 400 of them were unoccupied in the run up to Eid.
“We think that only 50 beds will have inpatients during Eid days. This happens every year,” a doctor said, adding that patient arrivals will go up tangibly after the post-Ramazan festival is over.
He, however, said the accident and emergency departments functioned as usual because those with critical problems and injuries were brought in for treatment.
“Not only public sector hospitals but the private healthcare centres, too, are facing an acute shortage of patients in Ramazan. We [private hospitals] aren’t getting more patients in the current month of fasting, so we’ll struggle to earn enough to pay for utility bills,” a senior surgeon at a private hospital in Peshawar told Dawn.
He said people having minor health issues or requiring minor surgeries could fast, but they preferred putting off consultations and treatment until after Eid.
“There are only a few minor surgeries that require patients not to fast for a day or two, but most patients don’t want to miss fasting for a single day,” he said.
The surgeon said private hospitals faced problems paying salaries to staff members due to low incomes in Ramazan.
He also said things were no different at privately-owned diagnostic centres, which, too, reported low patient arrivals during the month of fasting.
“The number of lab visitors nose-dives when Eid is just a few days away,” he said.
The surgeon, however, insisted that hospitals in both the public and private sectors received more patients after Eidul Fitr.
“It gets difficult for government hospitals to cope with high patient loads after Eid, and therefore, patients have to wait for longer periods to get treatment, while private hospitals work for additional hours to conduct more and more medical procedures,” he said.

4,Ex-Fata notified as merged districts,PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has officially communicated to all the departments and authorities...,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has officially communicated to all the departments and authorities concerned to no more append “newly” to the merged districts given that a considerable time has passed since their merger in 2018.
Henceforth, says an official notification issued by home and tribal affairs department, the newly-merged districts would be called as merged districts.
The notification stated that the chief minister was pleased to direct that keeping in view the passage of considerable time post-merger of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), the term newly-merged districts or NMDs for these areas may not be used.
“Instead, the term “merged districts” or (MDs for short) may be used, where required.”
On May 25, 2018, the then president Mamnoon Hussain had assented to the 25th Constitutional Amendment, leading to the merger of Fata into KP. Immediately after the merger, the authorities started referring the region as newly-merged districts.

5,KP opposes bill for Gandhara Corridor,CM aide insists proposed move interference in affairs of provinces,"MANSEHRA: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Saturday opposed the bill for the establishment of the “Gandhara Corridor” to connect Pakistan with the Buddhist world.
“The Gandhara Corridor Bill tabled in the National Assembly by member Ramesh Kumar is not acceptable to us for violating the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. This proposed law is an explicit interference in the affairs of provinces,” adviser to the chief minister on tourism and archeology Zahid Chanzeb told reporters here.
He said archeology and tourism were provincial subjects following the Eighteenth Amendment, so only the provinces could legislate about them.
“The centre cannot make laws on provincial subjects. The bill’s mover should ensure such legislation in the assembly of the Sindh province, which has huge archaeological ruins at Moen Jodaro,” he said.

CM aide insists proposed move interference in affairs of provinces

Mr Chanzeb said almost all Gandhara archaeological sites stood in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which would never allow “heists of its ancient treasures” by the centre through unconstitutional moves.
“I have taken up this bill with the chief minister, who decided to highlight it in the provincial assembly and other legal forums as an issue of provincial autonomy,” he said.
The adviser to the CM appreciated political parties for opposing the proposed law.
“We [KP] also condemn the establishment of the Gandhara Culture Authority by the caretaker government last year and demand that the centre devolves it to the provinces,” he said.
Mr Chanzeb said the ancient sites of Gandhara and other civilisations were the province’s great assets and revenue sources, so the provincial government won’t allow the federal government to deprive it of them.
He urged the centre to immediately clear the province’s dues for their utilisation for the welfare of the residents.
TIMBER SEIZED: Police seized a large quantity of timber here on Saturday after foiling a bid to smuggle it to Punjab.
SHO Aurangzeb Tanoli told reporters that over Rs3 million worth of wood taken from the local forests and being smuggled in a truck were taken into custody in the Chaterplan area.
He said police arrested the truck’s driver and cleaner and handed over the wood to the forest officer of Siren Division for action.
He said the newly-posted district police officer ordered a crackdown on outlaws, including drug pushers, and the action was under way in Chatterplan, Battal, and adjoining areas.
“We [police] have increased patrols on the Karakoram Highway,” he said.

Establishment of the church had been the longstanding demand of the Christian community comprising over 500 families. 
Construction work on the building approved in December 2014 completed a few weeks ago, district administration officials said.
Members of the Christian community told Dawn that construction of the church building started in August 2020 after the then MPA Wilson Wazir performed its groundbreaking.
They said inauguration of the church located in the Civil Colony, Khar, had been kept under wraps over security reasons. Jamal Maseh, a Christian community member, expressed his pleasure over the establishment of the church.
Commenting on the development, Pakistan Minority Alliance’s Bajaur chapter president Parvez Maseh, 62, told Dawn that construction of a church in Bajaur was truly a historic moment for the community.
“We are thankful to the authorities for building the place of worship for us,” he said. He said the building was named as ‘United Church’, meaning it was for all the minority communities as well as the Muslims.
He said the authorities had provided five police personnel for security of the church.
However, he complained the authorities had yet to allocate land for a graveyard and a community centre for Christians.
He said absence of graveyard forced the community members to bury their dead in Malakand, Mardan, Nowshera and Peshawar graveyards.
Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Mohammad Anwarul Haq told Dawn that the Christian community had long been demanding church in Bajaur. He expressed the hope that the issue of graveyard would be resolved soon.
BAN: The district administration on Saturday banned firing in the air, use of firecrackers, display and carrying of weapons, swimming and boating in dams and rivers for 10 days.
A statement issued by deputy commissioner Mohammad Anwarul Haq said the ban imposed under Section 144 aimed to ensure better security for people and to maintain law and order situation in the district ahead and during the forthcoming Eidul Fitr. The statement said the ban was slapped to avoid such activities on Chand Raat that might cause damage to life and property of people. It said the order came into force with immediate effect.

9,CM orders increase in food budget for jails,Approves changes to jail food menu,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on Saturday directed authorities to increase annual food budget for prisons in the province from Rs1.5 billion to Rs2 billion.
During a meeting of the prisons department at the Chief Minister’s House here, Mr Gandapur also approved a proposal to change the food menu in jails to “serve meals of good quality” to prisoners, according to an official statement issued here.
He directed deputy commissioners of all districts to regularly examine the quality of meals served to people kept in their respective jails.
Additional chief secretary (home and tribal affairs department) Mohammad Abid Majeed, principal secretary to the chief minister Amjad Ali Khan, inspector general (prisons) Mohammad Usman Mehsud, and other senior officials attended the meeting.

Approves changes to jail food menu

The chief minister said free legal aid should be provided to the prisoners, who couldn’t afford to hire lawyers for their cases, and directed authorities to get the services of competent lawyers for the purpose.
He said expenses for the move would be borne by the provincial government.
Mr Gandapur called for speedy work on prioritised development projects in prisons and directed the finance department to issue the requisite funds.
He said the government would provide Rs1 billion to clear the liabilities of prisons for food, medicines, maintenance, and repairs.
The chief minister approved a proposal for “circle- and region-wise recruitment” and said staff members for prisons should be hired “purely on the basis of domiciles.”
He said he was satisfied with the ongoing jail reforms, especially the provision of skills development training to prisoners.
Mr Gandapur ordered the department to come up with a formal plan to “brand and market” the products made by prisoners and develop a proper showroom for those items.
He said the furniture made by prisoners should be purchased by government departments without tendering, while the income generated by their products would be spent on their own as well as their families wellbeing.

Earlier, officials briefed him about the ongoing reforms and development activities by the prison department and said the process to grant courts, police, and prosecution access to prisoner data was under way.

“Leopard attacks on the cattle and sheep are on the rise to our misery, but the Wildlife department hasn’t taken any measures to prevent them to protect our animals,” Hilkot Kotri villager Juma Khan told reporters.
Accompanied by a group of residents, he said the wildcats made their way into cattle pens from Peryai’s alpine reserved forests to kill goats.
He said such incidents were frequently happening in the region.
“If a wildcat attacks my family members, especially children, I can’t protect them, as the law prohibits physical attack on it even in self-defence,” he said.
He said the villagers were afraid of herding cattle and sheep for grazing due to the frequent movement of wildcats into the area.
When contacted, Toufeeq Shah, a watcher of the wildlife department, said the rising wildfire incidents had forced wildcats to leave their natural habitats.
He said Peryai’s reserved forests, which were spread from the Battal area to the Siren and Konsh valleys of Mansehra district, were home to wildcats, which came down to Hilkot Kotli and adjoining villages to prey.
“We’re striving to seize wildcats entering human settlements,” he said, adding that firecrackers were used to force wildcats out of caves and other hideouts.
Mr Shah said his department was conducting an inquiry after finding the remains of a wildcat suspected to have been killed by hunters in the area.
BAN ON FIRECRACKERS: The residents on Friday demanded a ban on the sale of firecrackers to prevent damage to public life and property.
