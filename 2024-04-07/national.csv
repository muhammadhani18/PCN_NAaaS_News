1,PTI hits out at CM Maryam for remarks against KP,Raoof lambasts Maryam for accusing KP of transporting lethal strings to Punjab; says PTI adopted a quite positive attitude towards Centre.,"ISLAMABAD: PTI leaders on Saturday criticised Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif for labelling Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as ‘a corridor of terrorists and smugglers’, adding that the PDM government was responsible for the resurgence of terrorism.
Speaking at a press conference along with Punjab PTI Secretary Information Shaukat Mahmood Basra, PTI Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan blasted her for blaming the KP government and PTI for political instability.
He said the Sharif family was known for enmity with KP, which was evident from Nawaz Sharif’s statement who used to call the people ‘fool’ for inflicting him and his party repeated defeats.
Mr Hasan also lambasted Maryam Nawaz for accusing KP of transporting lethal strings to Punjab. He said the Sharifs and their ‘facilitators’ were responsible for the resurgence of the terrorism in the country, claiming that the PML-N, PPP, MQM and other components of the PDM conspired to “topple a stable PTI government to create a political vacuum that was then filled by terrorists”.

Raoof says all provincial governments, except KP, are fake and unlawful

He said terrorism was not a new phenomenon as the issue dated back to the era when her father Nawaz Sharif was part of the government with the support of the military that “imported terrorism” in Pakistan.
Despite the PML-N mindset, he recalled, the PTI adopted a quite positive attitude towards the Centre, as recently KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur visited Islamabad to meet Prime Minister Shehbaz Shahrif and then Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi during a visit to Peshawar met CM Gandapur due to which the PTI faced a backlash and severe criticism from party cadres and supporters.
 
 

But he said they conveyed their rationale to the workers and activists to convince them that being a federating unit, it was a constitutional obligation to keep a healthy working relationship with the Centre despite differences.
However, he lamented that despite all the good gestures by the KP government, the Centre miserably failed to honour its responsibilities, as it neither appointed officers sought by the KP government nor release the long-pending funds of the province due to which the province was facing a financial constraint.
Moreover, Mr Hasan lashed out at Amir Muqam and other political rivals who were openly advocating enforcing a governor rule in the province even though such a move would be against the assembly’s resolution and thus unconstitutional.
He lamented that the Constitution was being disregarded, rule of law non-existent and morality ruined during the past two years.
He recalled that the political parties blaming the PTI for resurgence of terrorism had publicly badmou­thed the judges and generals.
People haven’t forgotten Nawaz Sharif’s Gujranwala speech, he said, adding that Sharifs had a history of “attacking state institutions as Nawaz’s goons attacked Supreme Court and bought judges”.
The PTI leader said that all provincial governments, except KP’s, are “fake and unlawful” and the reason of their frustration was that the nation rejected them on Feb 8, as none of the members of Sharif family including Nawaz Sharif could actually win their seats and soon the tribunals would expose their “polls fraud” before the nation.
 
 

He vowed that they would continue their struggle against “mandate theft” until reclaiming their mandate in KP, Punjab, Centre, Sindh and Balochistan. He went on to say that the people would not let the “criminals to escape” the country.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Basra said the Sharif family and the Punjab CM were taking revenge of the “humiliating defeat” in the elections. Then putting all the economic burden of government policies on farmers was highly condemnable, he said.
Due to very expensive fertilisers and the highest production cost, farmers were afraid of heavy financial losses, he added, while reminding people that Imran Khan’s government had adopted a “commendable policy of improving the economy of the farmers” who were given better reward for their labour.

6,"Govt’s economic measures show positive signs, claims Tarar","Dismisses political instability concerns, asserts increased business confidence in Pakistan.","LAHORE: Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that the incumbent government is actively taking measures to strengthen both the economy and industry, which are displaying positive signs.
In a press conference at the PML-N’s Secretariat, he mentioned that Bloomberg had clearly stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had a good experience in engaging with financial institutions and implementing economic reforms.
“The previous 16-month government rescued the country from default and stabilised the Pakistani rupee. Even during the interim government’s tenure, the rupee remained stable. This stability in the currency contributed to the stabilisation of the country’s economy, with positive developments observed in the stock exchange as well,” he emphasised.
He said all these positive indicators were showing that business confidence had increased in the country.

Dismisses political instability concerns, asserts increased business confidence in Pakistan

Contrary to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s statement, Mr Tarar said the positive economic indicators showed that business confidence had increased in the country.
 
 

Speaking at a maiden Apex Committee meeting on Friday, CM Maryam had said, “Foreign and local investors are afraid of investing in Pakistan because of political instability.”
Regarding a Guardian report on extrajudicial killings by India in different countries, Mr Tarar stated that today, the Foreign Office had issued a statement not only rejecting the Indian defence minister’s remarks but also condemning them.
He said that the international community should take notice of these extrajudicial killings.
“Pakistan is fully alert and capable of defending itself, but we desire peace in the region,” he added.
Mr Tarar mentioned his recent visit to Karachi, during which he met with journalist organisations including PBA, APNS, and CPNE. Discussions were held on the challenges facing the media industry, and issues concerning journalists and media workers were highlighted.
Mr Tarar assured that pending dues of media workers and reporters would be settled before Eidul Fitr.
He said an all-out effort would be made to ensure payment of pending dues in the next two days as per the direction of Prime Minister Sharif, adding that all approvals in this regard had been completed.

7,Sunni Ittehad Council asks ECP to postpone election of Senate heads,"Upper house is incomplete without the election on 11 vacant seats representing KP, petition argues.","ISLAMABAD: Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) Chairman Mohammad Hamid Raza on Saturday approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to seek postponement of April 9 elections being held to fill the seats of Senate chairman and deputy chairman.
A petition filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan in this regard said that election should be held to a date after polls in the upper house from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It argued that election on the 11 vacant Senate seats from KP and its notification were prerequisite under the Constitution for the election of Senate chairman and deputy chairman. The petition has been filed under Article 60, read with Article 218(3).
 
 

On April 2, election on the 11 seats were postponed on ECP order. The election was postponed on the grounds that members of the provincial assembly purportedly elected on the reserved seats as provided under Article 106 had not taken the oath of their offices and since the electoral college was incomplete, the arrangement for Senate election could not be made.

Upper house is incomplete without the election on 11 vacant seats representing KP, petition argues

The petition regretted that the ECP, in utter violation of the Constitution, delayed the elections to the KP Assembly despite clear mandate of the green book. This deviance from the Constitution should end at once to save the democracy in Pakistan, the petition pleaded.
The postponement of election on the vacant seats of Senate from KP by the ECP through the notification was an ugly manifestation of disregard to the Constitution, according to the petition.
 
 

The election on the reserved seats of the assembly had taken place pursuant to an ECP order of Feb 28. Thereafter, a writ petition was filed by SIC before the Peshawar High Court (PHC) against the ECP order that was dismissed on March 25. The matter is now before the Supreme Court as civil petition for leave to appeal has been filed by the council against the PHC judgement.
As a result of the postponement of the election from KP assembly, the mandate of the SIC was not respected and the reserved seats to which it was entitled to as per the law and under Articles 51 and 106 of the Constitution read with the Elections Act, 2017 were unlawfully denied to it and unconstitutionally allocated to other political parties, it added.
The vacant seats of the Senate were to be filled as per Article 59 and the law for which the KP assembly was the electoral college, the petition said, adding that the SIC had allotted tickets to its candidates who were most likely to be elected in the April 2 election, which were postponed.
But suddenly and without assigning any reasons and without issuing notice to the speaker of KP assembly, the ECP illegally and without lawful authority partially modified the notification, it argued.
Thus, it claimed, the April 2 notification was issued without lawful authority in as much constitutional violation as ECP has now announced election to the offices of chairman and deputy chairman with the exclusion of SIC whose mandate was continuously being denied.
The petition added that election to the offices of chairman and deputy chairman could not be held without holding elections to the vacant seats of the Senate from KP which amounts to undermining the provincial autonomy and due representation of KP in the Senate.
Under Article 60, election to the two offices of the Senate can only be held after the house has been duly constituted. With the electoral college incomplete and not duly constituted, this election would be another constitutional violation, it added.
