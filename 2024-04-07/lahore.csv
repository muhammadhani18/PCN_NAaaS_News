0,Suthra Punjab drive: LWMC to be operational in entire Lahore division this month,Municipal bodies sign agreement with Faisalabad WMC,"LAHORE/TOBA TEK SINGH: As the jurisdiction is being increased to bring other districts of the division on a par with the Lahore City District in terms of cleanliness, the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) is all set to take over the solid waste management control in the districts of Kasur, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib in near future. 
Since the Services and Assessment Management Agreement has also been signed between the LWMC and the respective municipal or district councils, the scheme is a part of the Punjab government’s plan to ensure cleaning of all urban and rural areas on a daily basis through an effective solid waste management system, as being practiced in Lahore.
“We have signed agreements with the respective authorities in the districts of Kasur, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib to take over the entire SWM control of these districts within this month,” LWMC Managing Director Babar Sahib Din told Dawn on Saturday. 
“After taking over the existing outdated SWM system there, we will move toward the outsourcing model under which we will engage private firms in primary and secondary waste collection and disposal in these districts.” 

Municipal bodies sign agreement with Faisalabad WMC

To a question, he said the shortlisting of firms would be made through a transparent bidding process that would take around two months to complete. 
“You can say the new cleanliness system will be put in place in these districts within a period of three months,” the LWMC MD added. 
He said the need to introduce the plan emerged after the Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif sought better sanitation in Punjab on the pattern of Lahore under the Suthra Punjab drive. “It is a programme that will be implemented at grassroots level starting from village/mauza /UC to tehsil to district headquarters. 
“In fact the Baldias (MCs etc) have miserably failed to keep cities, towns, villages etc clean. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to introduce modern systems in this regard,” he argued. 
On the other hand, Minister for Local Government Zeeshan Rafiq in a meeting held here on Saturday directed the LWMC to quickly complete all process to put the new system in place at the adjoining districts. Since the Services and Assessment Management Agreements have been signed, the LWMC should start bidding related jobs, he sought. 
He said according to the policy there should be no overlapping of rehabilitation work at any place by different agencies. All areas regarding municipal facilities should be equipped well.
“Whether the development scheme is small or big, the quality should be ensured,” he said, adding that joint teams of the district administration, WASA, LWMC and LDA must work together to accomplish this task. Development schemes for the proposed repair and maintenance in Lahore were reviewed during the meeting.
Speaking on the occasion, the Lahore commissioner said that all areas of Lahore city will be targeted and the details of rehabilitation works must be prepared for all nine zones. In all these zones, sewerage, drainage, road and PCC repair, patchwork and street lights related works would be carried out. He also clarified that no second agency would work in one place and area of expertise of other agency.
Later, a meeting was also held regarding sanitation and water filtration plants under the chairmanship of minister Zeeshan Rafiq and commissioner. The meeting was told that there were a total 960 water plants in the city, of which 285 were not operating. MCL’s 79 out of 87 water filtration plants were operational while all 574 water filtration plants of WASA were also operational.
LDA DG Tahir Farooq, DC Rafia Haider, Director Development Javed Rashid Chauhan, DC Sheikhupura, Dr Waqar Khan, DC Nankana Muhammad Arshad, MD WASA Ghufran Ahmed, CEO Ab e Pak Authority Muhammad Zohaib Butt, Chief Engineer Asrar Saeed, Deputy Director Hafiz Iqbal and officers of MCL and other departments were also present in the meeting. 
FWMC: An agreement was reached on Saturday between the Faisalabad Waste Management Company (FWMC) and 24 local bodies of Faisalabad division in a meeting held in the presence of Commissioner Silwat Saeed who handed over the agreement details to the DCs of all four districts.
A press release said under the agreement between the district governments and municipal committees of the division, sanitation staff and machinery in the four district councils, cities and municipal committees of the division would be handed over to the FWMC for better waste management.

Despite the intense exchange of gunfire, the gangsters managed to flee into the rugged terrain of tribal tehsil Koh Sulaiman, carrying the deceased member and the severely injured one with them.
District Police Officer Ahmed Mohyiddin said police swiftly responded to intelligence indicating the presence of Ladi gang members in the area. The gangsters initiated indiscriminate firing to halt the police’s advance. 
The ensuing crossfire resulted in the death of Yaqoob and critical injuries to Esa. Despite the efforts of the police, the gangsters escaped with their wounded accomplice and the deceased. 
Security measures have been intensified at checkpoints, including the Jhangi post along the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial boundary to thwart potential attacks by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan insurgents.
DPO Mohyiddin said earlier Dera Ghazi Khan police had on March 23 effectively repelled an assault by TTP activists on the Jhangi police post, situated at the provincial boundary of KP, utilising drone technology. 
He said the Dera Ghazi Khan police, despite limited resources, confronted three challenges - the surge in street crime, pursuit of the Ladi gang, and the looming threat of TTP attacks on police checkpoints established along the Punjab-KP provincial boundary.

7,Harking back: ‘Malang’ scholar who made dictator and tyrant relent,"Few people in Lahore, especially of old walled city, are revered and adored more than an exceptionally simple...","Few people in Lahore, especially of old walled city, are revered and adored more than an exceptionally simple scholarly man than Dr Nazir Ahmad, a former principal of Government College Lahore. Yet, sadly, little is written about him.
In my books he was, without doubt, Lahore’s greatest human being - simple and highly educated, honest to the core, fearless in his beliefs for he treated the poor and the rich and powerful equally. When he walked down a street, or rode his bicycle home, he was inconspicuous. That is the way he was, and admired for who he was.
Born on the 19th of December 1905, at Haveli Barood Khana, inside the old walled city, and grew up there. Just how he came to live there is a story in itself. His grandfather was the brother of the grandfather of Mian Mahmud Ali Kasuri. The family was brought from Kasur to Lahore, and they lived there in the ‘haveli’. His grandfather compiled the syllabus of the Anjuman Himayat-e-Islam. Allama Iqbal, Faiz and Taseer as well as other great men of the Freedom Movement interfaced with him.
The elder brother of Dr Nazir Ahmad was called Moti Shah, and he used to roam the streets as a ‘Malang’. So extreme simplicity was in his family. Their house was a side portion of the main Haveli Barood Khana.
After doing his MSc from the University of Calcutta he proceeded to London to work on his PhD, where he stayed from 1943 to 1950. His specialty was in cotton and its genes. Most high yielding varieties that we see today are because of his research. It was during this time that my late father, who was then working for the BBC as a war correspondent, met him.
One incident will illustrate the man. Outside the British Museum Library my father was conversing with the late Dr Ahsanul Islam, a student of Dr Nazir and my father’s first cousin. Dr Ahsan’s research led to the discovery of the DNA sequence. As they chatted out of the library came Dr Nazir with a book in his hand. He looked at the book and started crying helplessly. It turned out that he had been reading a copy of the original autobiography of ‘Hazrat Bilal’, the slave of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). The British invaders of Syria had managed to bring it from Damascus in December 1918 at the end of the First World War. Dr Nazir had a copy of the original.
And as he read out the lines he wept away helplessly. Such was his devotion. When I mentioned this episode to by dear friend Tipu Almakky, the next day he provided me with a translated printed version. Never has any book given me goose-pimples like that book by Bilal.
The British sent Dr Nazir to the Lyallpur Agriculture College, where his pioneering work on cotton helped him spread it to the fields. In between he was sent to the Cotton Research Institute in London.
In 1959 Dr Nazir Ahmad became the principal of Government College Lahore, a post he held till December 1965. His first action was to promote debates and dramatic and musical activities. He also insisted that each department should give their students research assignments. Soon the military dictatorship of Gen Ayub Khan learnt that the students of GC were through different mediums criticising his dictatorship.
In the days of Dr Nazir’s leadership both the liberal and exact arts were becoming admired and famous. The Governor of the West Pakistan, Nawabzada Amir Muhammad Khan of Kalabagh, a tyrant in his own right, accused Dr Nazir of being anti-government. He explained that it was a wrong description, but that it was the creation of different personal opinions, which put together shape the way people think. The Nawabzada, who had for some time been a Cambridge student, nodded his head and then transferred him as principal of the nearby teacher training college.
Dr Nazir quietly walked towards his new office, but students blocked his way. As the newly appointed Prof G N Butt proceeded to take over, the students blocked him and refused him entrance. Soon the college, and then every college in Lahore, was up in arms. Amazingly the students in Dacca (now spelt Dhaka) in East Pakistan went on strike too. The whole country was demonstrating.
In Lahore a massive demonstration was organised which surrounded the Governor House, and refused to move till the transfer was cancelled. They were shouting: “Hamara Baap Hamay Wapas Karo”. The dictator and the tyrant succumbed to pressure as strikes spread to even industrial concerns. It was unprecedented in its spread and effect.
In 1965 the Centenary Celebrations of GC Lahore were held and both President Ayub and Governor Kalabagh were invited. Guests from all over the country, from India and abroad, flocked the GC College Oval. When Dr Nazir shook their hands, the slogan again went wild.
In December 1965 Dr Nazir retired and immediately set about researching the works of Sufi saints. One of his students, Syed Babar Ali, managed to get him to work on this effort in the Packages Limited office. There he produced an amazing book titled ‘Kalam-e-Bullah Shah’ as well as other books on the Sufi saints.
During this period, I joined the group after returning from England. As I drove home, I saw him walking. I stopped my car and offered to drop him at his home. He flatly refused and said: “I have legs, I will manage”. Seeing my disappointment he immediately added: “OK, as you are son of Hamid Jaan, drop me at the bus stop, so both are vindicated”.
As Dr Nazir lived in the house portion next to Dr Ahsanul Islam, my uncle, behind the GC Zoology Department, one often got to meet him. He would chat on a variety of topics. But his first question always was: “Which book are you reading at the moment?” He would then discuss the book.
Last year his daughter-in-law, Mrs Hina Jiwan Shah, inaugurated the ‘Dr. Nazir Ahmad Institute of Biological Sciences’ of the GC University. It is an abiding tribute to a citizen of our ancient city, to our finest educational institution, and the finest human to walk the streets of this amazing city.
Dr Nazir Ahmad passed away in August 1985, but his name and reputation live on. Simple and austere and admired by one and all, surely there is every reason why he should not be our favourite human being.

“I want to commend those judges who have raised the issue of interference in the judicial affairs,” she said in a handwritten statement given to the reporters at an anti- terrorism court.
She said justice could not prevail in Pakistan until the intervention in the courts was eliminated.
She alleged that the meddling was not only in the higher courts but was prevalent in every court of Punjab. If interference had not existed, individuals like Sana Javed and Aaliya Hamza of the PTI would not have been rearrested and sent to Sargodha jail, she said in the statement.
Dr Yasmin called Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz “Madam Ruthless” and held her responsible for ‘oppression’ against the women of Punjab.
She appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to take notice of the ‘injustice’.
Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry said the incomplete election of the chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate would be a disrespect to the parliament if conducted in its current form.
He said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a unit of the federation and excluding it from the electoral process would have consequences.
He said completing representation of KP in the senate is the responsibility of the federal government and the election commission.
The incarcerated senator stated that ‘rigging’ on the reserved seats is a blunder of the ECP, which would have repercussions for the entire nation.
The PTI leaders were produced before the court for the hearing of a case of burning police vehicles near Rahat Bakery in the cantonment during the May 9 riots.
Judge Arshad Javed adjourned further hearing till April 24.

According to an order of Specialized Healthcare and Medical Education Department (SH&MED), dated April 3, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Dr Muhammad Iqbal Malik (SMO/BPS-18) under the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act 2006 on the charges of misconduct. Dr Rao Rashid Qamar, the principal of the Nishtar Medical College, Multan, was the inquiry officer through an order on Nov 25, 2022. 
There were allegations against Dr Malik that on April 23, 2022, he, along with other doctors working in the emergency department, forcibly entered the office of Dr Farhana Khalid (SWMO/BPS-18), the then DMS emergency department of the hospital. They were protesting against her intervention in the modification of the duty roster of emergency medical officers (EMOs), especially those working on the night duty.  
They allegedly misbehaved with Dr Farhana, committed verbal abuse, attempted to manhandle her and threatened her with consequences while they harassed her in her office too.  
The inquiry officer conducted the inquiry and furnished his report April 10, 2023, indicating that the charges leveled against the accused officer had been proved. The inquiry report said the show-cause notice was served on the accused doctor to afford him an opportunity of personal hearing, which he availed.  
The special secretary (operations) SH&MED, in exercise of the powers conferred upon him as competent authority, imposed the major penalty on Dr Malik under the PEEDA Act. 
Dr Farhana Khalid told this correspondent that in the case of harassment, some high-ups of the SZMCH, including a senior gynecologist, had saved the other accused involved in the case. She said she had even complained to the woman ombudsperson over harassment against women at the workplace but she didn’t get relief.  
When contacted, SZMCH spokesperson Dr Ali Burhan didn’t reply to the calls of this correspondent.  
The hospital’s focal person and deputy medical superintendent, Rana Ilyas Ahmed, told Dawn he would reply after discussing the matter with the medical superintendent but the reply never came.

The prime suspect, Faisal, his brother and their father Abdul Sattar, have been arrested and are in police custody.
In the First Information Report (FIR), registered under section 155C of Police Order and sections 3 and 18 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, complainant Station House Officer (SHO) Muhammad Hasan stated that the private TV channel’s reporter Rana Khalid Mahmood and cameraman Ali Ahmad violated the laws by recording video statements of the suspects in custody, without permission of the authorities concerned.
However, no arrest has so far been made in the case.
Meanwhile, the journalists’ organisations have expressed concern over registration of the case under PECA, saying it was beyond Punjab police’s domain to book any media person under the law.

The TV reporter, Rana Khalid, claims his lawyers had filed his pre-arrest bail plea before an additional district and sessions judge (AD&SJ), who refused to hear it with the remarks that the cases under PECA should be heard by a Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) court.
