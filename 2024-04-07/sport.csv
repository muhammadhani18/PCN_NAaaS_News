The International Olym­pic Committee (IOC) in June decided to strip the International Boxing Association’s (IBA) of recognition over its failure to complete reforms on governance, finance and ethical issues.
The boxing tournaments at the Paris Games this summer are being organised by the IOC, but there are fears it might be excluded from future Games, with the sport not on the initial programme for Los Angeles 2028.
“I believe boxing can’t come out of the Olympics. It’ll be a disaster, young people’s hopes, dreams will be crushed,” Welsh­woman Price told Sky Sports in an interview published on Friday.
“I believe the Olympics is the pinnacle of the sport and that’s where your best boxers come from, you look at the likes of (Floyd) Mayweather and people like that, they went through that process as well. It is very important that boxing stays in.
“You don’t get any higher than the Olympics, so for me, if someone said to me, you could go to the World Championships with IBA or you’re going to the Olympic Games, I know which one I would pick.”
The IBA’s rival governing body World Boxing has said it will seek recognition from Olympic organisers to replace the IBA and ensure the sport remains a part of the Games for LA28.

CHARLESTON: US top seed Jessica Pegula saved four match points to eliminate two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka on Friday and advance to the WTA Charleston Open semi-finals.
Pegula squandered four match points at the clay court event before denying Azarenka’s four chances to advance and finally captured a 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (9-7) victory after two hours and 36 minutes when Azarenka hit a forehand service return long.
“That was an emotional roller coaster,” Pegula said.  “It was like that the entire match. I was playing really well and then I got frustrated I didn’t break in the second and she kind of turned it up a gear.
“I was able to get back in the third but it was really up and down, I feel like, from the end of the second, start of the third.
“At the end, it was really windy so a lot of awkward points. It’s tough when it’s windy, playing with your nerves as well. I’m just happy I got through.”
Pegula advanced to a Saturday semi-final against fourth seed Daria Kasatkina, who battled back to beat Romania’s Jaqueline Cristian 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-3 after two hours and 42 minutes.
Miami Open champion Danielle Collins, who won twice on Thursday to reach the quarter-finals, ousted Belgian 11th seed Elise Mertens 6-3, 6-4, stretching the American’s win streak to 11 matches.
Collins, who ousted 2023 champion Ons Jabeur and fellow American Sloane Stephens on Thursday, will face Greek third seed Maria Sakkari in the semi-finals after she eliminated ninth seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-2, 6-4.
Pegula equalised her rivalry with Azarenka at 3-3, but only after a tenacious third-set finish.
“We were playing some good tennis there at the end,” Pegula said.  “I had match points, 40-love on her serve, and that’s frustrating but I was just trying to stay focused to win and at the end, I don’t know what happened — I have no idea.
After squandering her chances for the victory, then falling behind 6-3 in the tie-breaker, Pegula admitted she was less than confident.
“At 6-3, I didn’t have any trust,” she said.
Pegula, who has never won a WTA clay-court crown, reached two prior semi-finals this year in Adelaide and San Diego. Her most recent final was last November at the WTA Finals and her most recent of four career WTA titles was last October at Seoul.

2,Lille beat Marseille to boost Champions League hopes,PARIS: Canadian star Jonathan David scored his 23rd goal of the season to set Lille on the way to a 3-1 win over...,"PARIS: Canadian star Jonathan David scored his 23rd goal of the season to set Lille on the way to a 3-1 win over Olympique de Marseille on Friday that kept them firmly on course for next season’s Champions League.
David’s penalty put Lille ahead early in the second half. Remy Cabella doubled their lead on 71 minutes by scoring against his former club.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang claimed a goal back for Marseille, but substitute Gabriel Gudmundsson made sure of the victory for Lille late on.
The northern side, who face Aston Villa next week in their first ever European quarter-final in the Europa Conference League, move up to third in Ligue 1 ahead of the rest of the weekend’s matches.
They are a point behind second-placed Brest and ahead of AS Monaco in fourth on goal difference, with the gap to OGC Nice in fifth now six points.
The top three in Ligue 1 will qualify automatically for next season’s expanded Champions League, with the team in fourth entering Europe’s elite club competition in the preliminary rounds.
Marseille are seventh, which may yet be enough to sneak into Europe next season depending on who wins the French Cup, but they are a huge 10 points adrift of the top four and only have six matches left to play.
Marseille, who face Benfica in Portugal in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final next week, have lost four straight matches in all competitions.
Prior to that, they had recorded five wins on the bounce following the appointment of Jean-Louis Gasset as their third coach this season.
Lille were seeking to extend an impressive home record which had seen them lose just one of their previous 37 matches at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy, going back to August 2022.
They went ahead nine minutes after the break when David converted from the spot after he had been fouled in the box by Samuel Gigot.
Sixteen of his goals have come in Ligue 1, with only Kylian Mbappe, who has 24 for Paris St-Germain, scoring more.
Cabella curled in a delightful shot to make it 2-0 for Paulo Fonseca’s impressive team, before Aubameyang gave Marseille a glimmer of hope, appearing to get the last touch as Lille’s defence made a mess of clearing their lines.
Shortly after that, in the 84th minute, Gudmundsson swept in Lille’s third goal as they prepared in the best possible manner for next Thursday’s trip to Villa Park.
Brest host struggling Metz on Sunday, with Monaco entertaining Rennes and Nice going to Reims later the same day.

3,Cameroon minister defends appointment of coach,YAOUNDE: Camer­oon’s sports minister has written to the national football federation (FEC­AFOOT) to defend the...,"YAOUNDE: Camer­oon’s sports minister has written to the national football federation (FEC­AFOOT) to defend the appointment of a new national football team coach, after FECAFOOT expressed surprise the decision was taken without its input.
In the letter seen by Reuters, minister Narcisse Mouelle Kombi said the ministry had acted in accordance with national and international regulations when it appointed Belgian Marc Brys to take over as coach of the Indomitable Lions after the dismissal of Rigobert Song in February.
FECAFOOT on Wednesday said the ministry had appointed Brys unilaterally and vowed to seek an explanation for this  “regrettable situation”.
Any dispute between the government and the federation risks a potential ban from international competition for the five-times African champions as FIFA has strict rules against government interference in federations.
In the letter, Kombi said his ministry’s appointment of coaching staff  “in no way affects the autonomy of FECAFOOT and does not violate any of the regulations.

5,Both sides see red as Frankfurt snatch draw with Bremen,BERLIN: Eintracht Frankfurt came from a goal down to draw 1-1 at home in a feisty match with Werder Bremen on Friday...,"BERLIN: Eintracht Frankfurt came from a goal down to draw 1-1 at home in a feisty match with Werder Bremen on Friday as both sides finished a man down.
Frankfurt had the better of the opening half, Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush twice forcing desperate saves from Bremen goalie Michael Zetterer.
The hosts survived a handball penalty call early in the second, VAR ruling against punishing Milos Veljkovic despite contact with the arm.
Frankfurt’s stay of execution was brief, with Veljkovic pouncing after home ‘keeper Kevin Trapp parried a free-kick and slotting in the opener after 62 minutes.
Seemingly on course for their first win since mid-February, Bremen were reduced to 10 men after 73-minutes when Jens Stage saw straight red for a brutal challenge on Jean-Matteo Bahoya.
The hosts equalised just four minutes later, Tuta expertly heading over a helpless Zetterer.
The home side had the wind in their sails but hopes of victory were dashed in the final minute of regulation time, Tuta emulating Stage’s rough challenge and seeing red after sinking his studs into Felix Agu’s heel.
The draw means Frankfurt remain entrenched in sixth place and on course for European football, but midfielder Mario Goetze told DAZN he was disappointed.
“That doesn’t really help anyone. We really wanted the three points, but conceded that annoying goal. We have to do our job.”
Trapp agreed, saying the result was  “difficult to grasp.”
“We’re still sixth but it feels like there’s a negative cloud hovering over us. We could have made big steps (towards Europe) so it’s difficult to swallow.”
Bremen finish the night in 10th place but could be as low as 13th should results go against them this weekend.

6,Djokovic keeping his Monte Carlo expectations in check,MONTE CARLO: Novak Djokovic admitted on Saturday that he is not expecting too much from his clay game heading into...,"MONTE CARLO: Novak Djokovic admitted on Saturday that he is not expecting too much from his clay game heading into Sunday’s start of the Monte Carlo Masters.
The world number one who exited early on the Indian Wells hardcourts last month and did not play in Miami, had a training session at the Monte Carlo Country Club venue with fill-in coach Nenad Zimonjic.
But the 24-time Grand Slam titleholder was quick to emphasise that the arrangement is so far strictly temporary following his recent split with longtime mentor Goran Ivanisevic.
Djokovic said that building his clay game for Roland Garros is his main priority and that any result here will be  “a bonus”.
“The expectations are not very high,” the 36-year-old said.  “My results here in previous years (titles in 2013 and 2015) are not great.
“It’s all about building my game for clay courts. I want to reach my peak for Paris — that’s where I want to play my best tennis. “Anything else is a bonus, so let’s see what happens.”
The Serb shed slightly more light on his surprise split from 2001 Wimbledon winner Ivanisevic after winning 12 Grand Slam singles titles with the Croat heading his team.
“We felt we gave each other the maximum, it was time to move on — it’s pretty simple.
“Goran remains one of the most successful coaches in the history of the game.
“We’ve done something that cannot be deleted, the results speak for themselves. He also remains a dear friend of me and my family.”
Djokovic said that he will work to prepare for the Summer Olympic tournament to be staged in late July in Paris at Roland Garros.
“But there is this little tournament called Wimbledon which comes in between [the French Open and the Games]. The Paris Olympics are very important, the Olympics have always been a priority for me.
“But in the last three or four Olympics it’s not been possible for me to reach the later stages.
“The situation is a bit different now, we are playing our first Olympics on clay. I want to be ready physically and mentally.”

7,"Tiger appears set for Masters start despite ankle, back injuries","AUGUSTA: Tiger Woods appears set to make his 26th start at the Masters next week, but the 15-time major winner...","AUGUSTA: Tiger Woods appears set to make his 26th start at the Masters next week, but the 15-time major winner remains hampered by severe leg injuries from a 2021 car crash.
Woods, whose plane was tracked to Augusta a week ago, is listed to speak with reporters at Augusta National on Tuesday and remains among those in the tournament field on the event website rather than among non-playing champions.
But the 48-year-old US superstar, whose 82 PGA Tour wins shares the all-time record with Sam Snead, is struggling with injuries, according to his long-time pal Notah Begay.
“He’s trying to formulate a strategy and approach that he can work with given the constraints that he is presented with, and he has got some constraints,” Begay told reporters on Wednesday.
“He has got zero mobility in that left ankle and really has low-back challenges now, which he knew he was going to have.”
Woods won the 2019 Masters for his first major title since 2008, but has struggled since making his comeback from the 2021 auto accident at the 2022 Masters, finishing 47th when he struggled just to walk all 72 holes at the hilly layout.
Last year, Woods matched a Masters record by making a 23rd consecutive cut, pulling level with Gary Player and Fred Couples, but later withdrew due to plantar fasciitis and underwent ankle surgery last April.
The five-time Masters champion reportedly played Augusta National last weekend with pal Justin Thomas and Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley.
So far this season, the only PGA event Woods has played was at Riviera in February, when he withdrew after one round due to illness.
The main struggle for Woods is walking a full four rounds, Begay said.
“He has been trying to find a way to recover,” Begay said.  “He can play the golf. We always knew the question was going to be, ‘Can he walk the 72?’ That’s still up in the air.
“Can he recover from one round to the next? That’s the biggest question. I really don’t know and he’s not going to know either until he gets out there and figures out whether the way he has prepared for this year’s Masters is going to work for him.”
Woods has delivered some of the most spectacular shotmaking ever seen at Augusta National, creating roars that reverberated through the pines along the famed course.
He captured his first major title at the Masters in 1997, won again in 2001 to complete a  “Tiger Slam” of four major wins in a row, then joined Jack Nicklaus and Nick Faldo as the only back-to-back Masters winners with a 2002 triumph before taking the 2005 title.
In 2019, Woods completed a fairytale comeback by taking the Masters, having recovered from four back operations that left him wondering if he could have a normal life due to nagging pain, much less play golf again.
After his 2021 car crash, in which he suffered a shattered ankle and multiple fractures in his right leg, Woods said he was thankful to still have the leg but battled back for more than a year to make a comeback at the 2022 Masters.
Since then, however, Woods has played in only three majors, withdrawing at last year’s Masters and the 2022 PGA Championship and missing the cut at the 2022 British Open.

8,Zaka Ashraf says Shaheen should have been given more time as captain,"To a question regarding the composition of the selection committee, the former PCB chairman says it was wrong.","LAHORE: While terming Pakistan Cricket Board’s step of removing Shaheen Shah Afridi as captain to bring back Babar Azam a hasty decision, former PCB chief Zaka Ashraf has criticised the composition of the national selection committee announced recently.
“Shaheen should have been given some more time, at least one year, so that his performance [as skipper] could be analysed before taking any decision in this connection,” Zaka said while talking to reporters at an Iftar party in Lahore on Saturday.
During Zaka’s tenure as PCB chief, Babar stepped down as captain of all three formats, and Shaheen was named the T20 skipper following Pakistan’s disastrous show in the Asia Cup and the World Cup in November last year. However, Pakistan under Shaheen in his first series as national captain suffered a 4-1 drubbing in New Zealand in January. 
“We took the decision to change Babar as captain because though he is the best batsman of the world but we observed that he as captain looked under pressure. So we replaced him [with Shaheen] so that he can fully concentrate on his batting,” Zaka said.
“We wanted to keep Babar as Test captain but he gave up the captaincy of all formats; it was his own [Babar’s] decision.
“However, now as the PCB has brought Babar back [as captain] as a Pakistani I can have best wishes for the national team,” he said.
The seven-member national selection committee announced by the Mohsin Raza Naqvi-led PCB contains seven members out of whom five members — Mohammad Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, Babar Azam and analyst Bilal Azhar — are prominent former cricketers from Lahore. Only one member, former Pakistan batter Asad Shafiq, belongs to Karachi.
To a question regarding the composition of the selection committee, Zaka said it was wrong.
“The national selection committee should have representation from all the provinces,” he said categorically and expressed surprise at the committee which has no head.
Answering a question, Zaka urged the PCB to announce the report of the inquiry which he had initiated against Saya Corporation, a players’ agent company which had signed around 44 Pakistan cricketers including Babar.
“The PCB should make the report public as it is not good that so many players are attached with only one company,” Zaka emphasised.
He said Wahab, the then chief selector and now a member of the selection committee, had no role in advising him over changing Babar as captain, saying it was the prerogative of the chairman to appoint a skipper.

9,Paris-Roubaix cobbled ‘Hell’ looms as cycling faces crash crisis,"Miles of mud and millions of cobbles have lent the race the name of ""the Hell of the North"".","COMPIGNE: Defending champion Mathieu van der Poel goes into Sunday’s muddy, cobbled Paris-Roubaix bike race sceptical over new safety measures in a week when several of the sport’s biggest stars were hospitalised.
Miles of mud and millions of cobbles have lent the race the name of ‘the Hell of the North’ and a reputation of the most gruelling one-day race in cycling.
In 2018, one competitor the Belgian Michael Goolaerts was found slumped dead by the roadside after heart failure, and the peloton will pass a memorial to him along the route.
First run in 1896, broken wheels and broken bones have been part of the history of the annual race due to the hefty hunks of cobble that surface around 57km of the 260km route.
Organisers this week introduced a u-turn to slow the riders ahead of their entry into the legendary section outside the 650m deep Arenberg coal-mine.
World champion and one day racing’s hottest star van der Poel asked on X:  “Is this a joke”.
But as cycling fans tune in Sunday, their thoughts will be with Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard, Remco Evenepoel and Primoz Roglic, who were among those hospitalised after crashing at the Tour of the Basque Country on Thursday.
Of road cycling’s five huge one-day races known as the Monuments due to their epic length Paris-Roubaix, which now starts in Compiegne 80km from the French capital, is known as ‘Queen of the classics’ because it is the toughest.
The 25 teams select seven of their sturdiest riders on the cobbles to cope with the repeated punctures and frequent falls.

10,"City outgun Palace to remain in title hunt, Everton edge Burnley",The win lifts City to 70 points — behind leaders Liverpool on goal difference.,"LONDON: Manchester City pulled level with Liverpool at the top of the Premier League on Saturday after beating Crystal Palace 4-2 as Everton secured a vital 1-0 win against Burnley in their bid to avoid relegation.
City’s Kevin De Bruyne netted twice and top-scorer Erling Haaland hit his 19th league goal of the season, with Rico Lewis also on the scoresheet.
The win lifts City to 70 points — behind leaders Liverpool on goal difference.
Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool face a trip to mercurial Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday in the next chapter of a thrilling title race.
Jean-Philippe Mateta gave Crystal Palace a shock early lead at Selhurst Park in the early kick-off but De Bruyne levelled in the 13th minute with a curler into the top corner to quell any nerves from the visitors.
Palace carried an attacking threat but Lewis put City ahead just after half-time and De Bruyne and Haaland combined for the third.
Midfielder De Bruyne added his second with a solo effort in the 70th minute — his 100th goal for the club — to make the game safe, before substitute Odsonne Edouard scored a consolation.
City boss Pep Guardiola hailed the Belgium international, who missed five months of the season with a hamstring injury he sustained in the opening match at Burnley.
“Sometimes it’s Phil (Foden), Erling or Julian (Alvarez), today it was Kevin,” he said. “Without him we would not be able to win this. You talk about managers but players like Kevin make this game easy.”
In Saturday’s later match, Everton went into their match against second-from-bottom Burnley desperately searching for a spark of inspiration after a run of 13 Premier League matches without a win.
They struggled to impose themselves but benefited from a huge error from visiting goalkeeper Arijanet Muric in first-half stoppage time.
Muric took too much time to clear the ball and when he did it was straight at Dominic Calvert-Lewin, with the ball rebounding off the forward into the net.
“Its a massive result, it was a must-win in many ways,” Calvert-Lewin  told Sky Sports.  “We’re happy with the 1-0 but we thought we could  improve in the second half. 
“We knew Burley overplay at times, so if we could set traps like  we did for the goal, wed have a chance. A few games ago I might not have  scored a goal like that, but thats how it goes.”
The win means Everton are now four points above the relegation zone.
But the club need everything they can get as they wait nervously to find out if they will be handed a second points deduction this season for breaking Premier League financial rules.
Meanwhile, fourth-placed Aston Villa, beaten in midweek by City, will rue a second-half collapse that could prove costly in their chase to qualify for next season’s Champions League.
Unai Emery’s men drew 3-3 against Brentford but only after tossing away a 2-0 lead.
Villa led 2-0 moments into the second half after goals from Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rodgers but three goals in nine minutes from Mathias Jorgensen, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa turned the match on its head.
Watkins scored his second goal of the game in the 80th minute but Villa could not find a winner and they are just three points above fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who have two games in hand.
“It’s frustrating, we lacked that big team mentality where they kill games off which is really disappointing,” Watkins told BBC. 
“I’m not belittling my team. I’m part of it. I feel we need to somehow figure out when we’re 2-0 up how to just shut up shop. 
“There is a lot of football to be played. We’re battling with  Tottenham who have got a great squad. It’s going to be tight. We need to  win the next six games.” 
Elsewhere, Carlton Morris scored a 90th-minute goal in Luton Town’s 2-1 win against Bournemouth — a result that leaves them in the relegation zone but now level on points with 17th-placed Nottingham Forest.
Newcastle United beat Fulham 1-0 courtesy of a late goal from Bruno Guimaraes to keep alive their hopes of European football next season while West Ham United  came from behind to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1.

12,Verstappen takes pole at Japan GP for third year in a row,Becomes first driver to take pole in the opening four races of a season since Lewis Hamilton.,"SUZUKA: Formula One world champion Max Verst­appen took pole position for a third straight year at the Japanese Grand Prix on Saturday, with Sergio Perez qualifying a close second to ensure a Red Bull front-row lockout.
Verstappen set the pace with a lap of one minute 28.197 seconds — 0.066 seconds clear of Perez — becoming the first driver to take pole in the opening four races of a season since Lewis Hamilton nine years ago.
But with McLaren’s Lando Norris, Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso in the other top five spots and all within half a second of Verstappen, Sunday’s race promises to be a closer affair than the Dutchman’s 2023 procession.
“It was very close in the end,” said Verstappen, looking to bounce back from a mechanical issue that prevented him from finishing the race last time out in Melbourne.  “Nevertheless most importantly to be on pole — of course you want every lap to be perfect but at a track like this it isn’t always the case.”
Perez was in third place heading towards the end of a gripping  qualifying session in dry conditions but he almost jumped into top spot  with an inspired final effort.
The Mexican said it was  “quite difficult to get the perfect lap nailed”.
“It  was close today but I think the whole weekend has been good,” said  Perez, who finished runner-up behind Verstappen in the first two grands  prix of the season. “We made some good progress and we managed to keep some consistency through qualifying. Let’s see what we are able to do on Sunday,” he added.
Norris, who finished second in Suzuka last year, will start Sunday’s race third on the grid, qualifying 0.292 seconds behind Verstappen.
“We had a good car today, we could fight,” said Norris.  “We are trying to catch up to the Red Bulls, but they are doing a good job so hats off to them.”
While Sainz, who won the last race in Australia after Verstappen’s withdrawal, qualified in fourth, his team-mate Charles Leclerc had a difficult drive, which will put him back in eighth for Sunday’s start.
“That’s the best I can do. Honestly, I don’t get it,” a frustrated Leclerc said over the team radio towards the end of qualifying.
Aston Martin’s Alonso and McLaren’s Oscar Piastri, celebrating his 23rd birthday, finished in fifth and sixth, respectively.
Seven-times world champion Hamilton and George Russell, both of Mercedes, finished in seventh and ninth, but Hamilton sounded optimistic that a season beset by technical problems may be turning a corner.
“Its actually the first weekend I have not gone crazy with setup... It’s been really enjoyable driving. It’s just the guys are just a little bit faster,” the Briton said.
Mercedes incurred a 5,000-euro ($5,400) fine in qualifying for an unsafe incident after Russell nearly collided with Piastri in the pit lane when exiting his garage.
Local hero Yuki Tsunoda got one of the biggest cheers of the day when he snuck into the final round of qualifying and will start 10th on Sunday.
He once again finished ahead of his more experienced team mate at RB, Daniel Ricciardo, heaping pressure on the Australian driver, whose seat is at risk with the highly regarded reserve driver Liam Lawson waiting in the wings.
“Im kind of relieved that I’m able to go through to Q3 in front of Japanese fans because I felt slightly more pressure compared to the past three years,” said Tsunoda. “I super enjoyed being in front of the Japanese crowd.”
Alonso’s Aston Martin team-mate Lance Stroll struggled meanwhile and was knocked out in the first round of qualifying. He will start near the back of the grid in 16th.
