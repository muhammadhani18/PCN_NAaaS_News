1,LPG agency fire leaves one injured,A fire broke out in the agency of LPG cylinders in Rawalpindi's Gulzar Quaid Nawaz Colony,"A fire broke out in the agency of LPG cylinders in Gulzar Quaid Nawaz Colony, within the limits of the Airport police station, Rawalpindi.
One man was injured due to severe burns from the fire while the three-storied residential building in which the agency was located was also damaged.
According to reports, a fire suddenly broke out in the LPG gas cylinders agency located on the lower floor of a three-storey building in the Nawaz Colony area adjacent to the Airport police station. Within moments the gas cylinders inside the agency were engulfed, which caused them to explode in succession with intermittent, loud explosions.
The video footage of the fire incident has also surfaced, in which the agency located in a densely populated area can be seen suddenly catching fire, followed by the loud explosions of bursting gas cylinders. In the footage, announcements for help from the nearby mosque opposite the scene of the incident can also be heard.
On receiving the information, Rescue 1122 and SHO Airport Hamid Kazmi reached the spot along with police personnel. It took 25 rescue and firefighters along with five rescue fire tenders, to control the fire and contain it.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson told The Express Tribune, “The explosions of LPG gas cylinders during the fire worsened the situation, also causing a person to suffer from serious burns. We provided him with first aid and shifted him to the hospital.”
The cylinder refilling shop was situated in the basement of the three-storey residential building. The building was also severely damaged due to the fire and explosions. Additionally, two motorcycles were caught in the blaze and burnt to ashes.
Rawalpindi police officials said that in the initial investigation, the incident seemed to have been caused by an electrical short circuit. Further investigation is ongoing.

2,Eid shopping frenzy hits fever pitch,"Women rush to bazaars and pop-up vendors for accessories, henna","With Eidul Fitr just around the corner, shopping has started to gain momentum in city markets with a large number of people, particularly women and children, flocking to bazaars and malls.
A festive environment was noticed at the busy markets including Saddar, Lalkurti, Commercial Market, Moti Bazaar, Tench Bhatta, Peoples Colony, Raja Bazaar and various other markets of the town.
With less than a week before Eidul Fitr, the residents can be seen thronging shopping malls and other city markets. People are seen rushing to buy dresses and household items. Several local and international brands have begun displaying their latest Eid editions of dresses, shoes, and other essential accessories to attract buyers and gain maximum profits.
The shopkeepers have decorated their shops with colourful lights to attract customers. The shopping frenzy is expected to reach its peak during the next two to three days. Families come out for shopping soon after iftar and can be seen buying shoes, cosmetics, ready-made garments, eye-catching artificial jewellery, multi-coloured bangles and other items for the upcoming festival of Eidul Fitr. Large crowds of women could be seen gathered around the bangles and henna stalls in various areas of the city.
A bangle seller said, ""The number of customers is gradually picking up and hopefully it will go further up as Eidul Fitr approaches.""
A customer said, ""I have completed shopping for my kids and I have bought clothes and matching shoes.""
Hawkers are also making brisk sales of clothes, footwear, cosmetics, and other goods as these products are generally purchased by low-income people ahead of Eid, said another citizen. Temporary stalls selling ready-made clothes, bangles, earrings and cosmetics have also sprung up throughout the city.
Taking advantage of the shopping rush, some shopkeepers have also started to fleece the shoppers. Several Eid shoppers also complained of overpricing, especially of women's and kids' clothing.
They said that only a few people could afford to complete their shopping as it is difficult to buy clothes, footwear and other accessories during these inflationary times. ""The prevailing price-hike is limiting me to be content with buying clothes only for my children,"" said Amina, a visitor to Chota Bazaar in Saddar.
Sobia, who went to the Commercial Market, said buying bangles and henna was always one of the greatest Eid thrills. However, she complained that the shopkeepers were exploiting the Eid shopping frenzy and overcharging customers.
A shopkeeper at Raja Bazaar said a great number of shoppers were thronging markets and that he was having a good business. Rawalpindi police have increased the security of the bazaars and markets by deploying additional personnel. Meanwhile, special arrangements have also been made by the City Traffic Police to ensure traffic flow.

3,Transporters asked to ensure fair pricing,RTA issues stern warning against overcharging Eid travellers,"The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) has warned transporters against overcharging public transport fares from people going to their hometowns to celebrate Eidul Fitr with their families.
According to a spokesperson, it is a common feature that with the coming of Eid people go to their hometowns to celebrate the festival with their loved ones.
“People from abroad as well as major cities make it a point to be home with their kith and kin for the festivities. However, the transporters have a habit of fleecing the home-bound citizens by charging exorbitant rates,” he said.
He warned that stern action would be taken against transporters found overcharging and overloading the passengers. The staff concerned had been directed to check the overcharging and overloading of passengers in buses and vans, especially before Eidul Fitr, he said.
The checking was being carried out randomly at different places, he said adding, strict action would be taken on the spot and excess fares would be returned to the passengers.
The commissioner had also directed the RTA to control fares of Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) and take strict action against the violators without any discrimination.
According to the spokesperson, the RTA had finalised arrangements to conduct raids to check fares of the public transport.
The RTA under the supervision of its Secretary, was taking strict action by the law against overcharging. The secretary had instructed the officials concerned to make arrangements to control fares of public transport as people started going to their hometowns to celebrate Eidul Fitr, he added
Special squads had also been formed and deployed at bus and wagon stands to control overcharging and overloading, he said adding that a special control room had also been set up at the RTA office to monitor teams checking fares of buses and wagons in the bus stands.
The transporters and the management of the bus terminals had also been instructed to ensure implementation of the orders in letter and spirit or else strict action would be taken against the violators without any discrimination, he added.
Transporters were asked not to create an artificial shortage of buses and bring all their vehicles onto roads otherwise their licenses would be cancelled.
According to the secretary, they had cancelled the Eid holidays of their checking staff. “We are trying to control the phenomenon of overcharging ahead of Eid.” He advised the passengers to note the number of buses and wagons which are overcharging. “Passengers should inform us and we will take strict action against transporters,” he claimed.
Meanwhile, all bus and wagon terminals including railway stations on Saturday and Sunday remained jam-packed with passengers who were leaving for their native towns to celebrate Eidul Fitr with their families.
The passengers were seen running from one bus stand to the other in search of tickets, while the transporters taking full advantage of the situation were demanding enhanced fares from them.
Huge rush of passengers could be witnessed at all bus terminals and also at Rawalpindi Railway Station on the weekend.
On the other hand, as per ugly practices route transporters were openly looting helpless passengers by charging enhanced fares apart from charges of luggage.
The transporters at Pirwadhai, Faizabad, Rawat, Humrahi and Soan bus/wagon terminals were demanding enhanced fares from the passengers.
The official Eid holidays will begin on Wednesday (April 10) but the non-locals have started departing the twin cities for their hometowns on Saturday and Sunday which are off days, while the remaining would likely go till ‘Chand Raat’.
Similarly, a large number of passengers could be witnessed at Rawalpindi Railway Station waiting for trains. The majority of the passengers have already booked their seats but others are facing difficulties in the hunt for seats.
The influx of people returning to their hometowns has caused a surge in traffic at all 44 major and minor transport hubs throughout the district, including the Pirwadhai general bus stand.
The transport terminals of Pirwadhai, Peshawar Morr, Sawan, Faizabad, Pirwadhai GBS, and Pirwadhai Morr are experiencing a surge in passenger crowds.

4,Murree braces for Eid rush,Admin sets up 7 facilitation centres to accommodate tourists during holidays,"The Rawalpindi divisional administration and City Traffic Police have finalised recreational facilities and traffic plans for visitors of Malika Kohsar Murree and Galyat on the eve of Eidul Fitr.
Given the expected arrival of a large number of tourists from all over the country at the famous hill station and its surrounding areas, the facility centres have been established at seven different locations and an ‘organised’ traffic plan has been devised

Chairing a meeting, Commissioner Rawalpindi Engineer Aamir Khattak said that all arrangements were aimed at providing all possible assistance to the tourists on the occasion of Eid and that people should cooperate with the administration.
He said that as per the traffic plan, no parking would be allowed around the GPO Chowk, while timings for large vehicles would remain intact. The entry of motorcycles would be restricted beyond the specified point.

5,Two killed in suspected police shootouts,Constable narrowly escapes harm thanks to his bulletproof vest,"At least two suspects were killed by the firing of their accomplices during an exchange of fire with the police in an alleged encounter with the police in the Wah Cantt area of Rawalpindi.
Fortunately, a police constable narrowly escaped harm thanks to his bulletproof jacket, though one perpetrator managed to evade capture.
In a separate incident near the Sadiqabad police station, two suspects sustained injuries and were apprehended following a shootout, while another perpetrator fled the scene. Efforts are underway to locate and apprehend the fugitive.
Authorities revealed that officers stationed at a blockade on Bajar Road signalled three individuals on a motorcycle to stop, prompting the suspects to open fire.
Constable Waqas, fortunately protected by his bulletproof gear, was targeted but remained scathed. In the ensuing exchange, two suspects fell to the bullets fired by their companions while attempting to flee.
The identity of the deceased is currently under investigation, and the stolen motorcycle used in the incident was traced back to a recent theft in Wah Cantt. The recovered weapons have been seized for further examination, and the bodies of the deceased suspects have been transferred to a local hospital for post-mortem analysis.
Shortly thereafter, another alleged encounter unfolded in the Shakriyal area under the jurisdiction of Sadiqabad police station. A security patrol attempted to halt three suspicious motorcyclists, only to be met with gunfire from the suspects.
Two gunmen sustained injuries during the exchange, while an accomplice managed to escape. The wounded suspects were swiftly taken into custody and transported to a medical facility for treatment, with the seized weapons and motorcycle undergoing forensic examination.
Senior police officials swiftly responded to the scene, commending the courageous actions of the personnel involved in confronting these perilous suspects.
Rawalpindi CPO Khalid Hamdani lauded the officers’ bravery and emphasised the ongoing efforts to identify and apprehend all individuals involved.
The CPO reiterated the commitment of law enforcement to pursue and prosecute those who endanger the lives and property of citizens and police alike, ensuring that they face the full consequences of their actions.

6,Inflation bites Eid shoppers at model bazaars,"Shopkeepers sell readymade garments, shoes at exorbitant rates","Ramazan model bazaars in Rawalpindi city have gone beyond the reach of shoppers ahead of Eidul Fitr as shopkeepers are selling garments and shoes especially for children and vermicelli at exorbitant prices.
On the other hand, the tailors across the city have also increased the rates of stitching of a male’s single suit from Rs1,500 to Rs1,700. High stitching rates led to an increase in the sale and purchase of ready-made shalwar kameez in the open market.
This year, the City District Administration didn’t set up 16 traditional cheap Ramazan bazaars owing to high inflation and the non-allocation of the subsidy by the government. In their place, three Ramazan model bazaars were set up at different places in the city during the holy month but sellers charged higher owing to inflation and non-subsidy.
From the 20th of Ramazan onward, these model bazaars were converted into Eid model cheap bazaars with no relief in prices. In model Eid bazaars, readymade garment suits for boys are being sold at Rs4,500 to Rs9,000 and readymade garment suits for girls are being sold at Rs5,000 to Rs10,000. Similarly, the pairs of shoes for both boys and girls are being sold at Rs2,500 to Rs4,000. But the quality of these suits and shoes is extremely poor.
The prices of all Eid sweet dishes in these model bazaars have also stunned the buyers.
Where the city tailors are charging high for stitching, they have stopped sewing shalwar kameez at a single rate and displayed no booking notices at their shops. However, new suits are being booked at a sewing rate of Rs2,000.
Fayyaz Hashmi, the secretary general of Tailors Union Rawalpindi, says they earn in Eidul Fitr and Eidul Azha – two seasons in a year. Until the 15th of Ramazan, the tailors across the city booked per suit for Rs1,500 and now they are charging Rs2,000 per suit.
On the other hand, the citizens have criticised the arbitrary increase in stitching rates by the tailors. Mehmood Akhtar says instead of giving a free hand to the tailors to set the prices of stitching, the Deputy Commissioner should have set the official rates and crackdown against violators.
