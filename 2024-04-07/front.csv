0,Country set to repay $1b against Eurobond,SBP says it’s waiting for finance ministry’s nod to go ahead with it,"Pakistan is set to repay a foreign debt worth $1 billion against a 10-year Eurobond maturing in the middle of the ongoing month.
This will reduce the stock of the debt acquired through selling Eurobonds and Sukuks in international markets to below $7 billion.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) told The Express Tribune that it was ready to repay the bond anytime and waiting to receive instructions to do so from the finance ministry.
The maturing Eurobond 2024 hit a new record high price at $1 per unit on the global investors' optimism that Pakistan would repay it at or before maturity on April 15 after the country’s foreign exchange reserves improved significantly to over $8 billion.
This has enhanced the country’s capacity to repay all the upcoming maturing foreign debt on time.
Topline Securities CEO Muhammad Sohail recalled that Pakistan had repaid the last Eurobond of $1 billion days before its maturing date in December last year despite facing a foreign exchange reserves crisis at that time.
He added that the Pakistani 2024 bond had rallied by more than 160% -- excluding coupon and interest payment -- in the last 18 months, mostly after Pakistan secured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan package of $3 billion in late June 2023.
SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said Pakistan had fully arranged repayments against the debts in the ongoing fiscal year 2023-24, including the $1 billion Eurobond maturing in April this year.
The Topline Securities CEO observed that Pakistan had not only successfully repaid its $1 billion Eurobond in 2023 despite the then financial crisis but also managed to bolster its foreign exchange reserves held by SBP, currently standing at $8 billion -- excluding the $5 billion in the possession of the country’s commercial banks.
“Earlier, concerns loomed large as foreign exchange reserves fell below $3 billion in February last year raised fears of a potential default on bond repayments,” he added.
Following the repayment of $1 billion in April, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves will experience a decline.
However, the anticipated IMF tranche of $1.1 billion, likely to be received by the end of April, is expected to restore the reserves back to over the $8 billion mark.
Furthermore, Sohail said the recent increases in inflows from foreign portfolio investors purchasing shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) and treasury bills, coupled with the SBP’s gradual acquisition of US dollars from the market, were contributing to the management of regular debt repayments.
The price of the Eurobond worth $500 million, maturing in September 2025, has increased significantly currently hovering at 96.2 cents per US dollar after Pakistan achieved the IMF staff-level agreement for the last tranche of $1.1 billion last month.
The prices of other global papers also improved along with the two maturing ones in 2024 and 2025.
Pakistan’s total eight Eurobonds and Sukuks are trading in global markets at $7.8 billion, maturing by up to April 2051.
Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has floated the idea of selling Panda bond in the Chinese market to raise $300 million.
This will help in stabilising the foreign exchange reserves and support the local currency to remain stable at the current strong level of Rs277.93 per US dollar.
Former caretaker finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar had decided against entering the international debt markets to float new bonds considering that they remained tight amid the significantly high interest rate of the country.
Pakistan's stable currency has played a critical role in boosting foreign investor confidence in the domestic economy and its debt instruments.
The Pakistani rupee has emerged as the best-performing currency in the region, appreciating by 3.1% to $177.93 against the greenback in the current fiscal year 2023-24 so far, according to the data compiled and reported by Topline Research.
To recall, the domestic currency has improved 10.5% or over Rs29 in the past seven months, hitting a five-and-half-month high at Rs277.84 per US dollar this week.
This was against its all-time low closing at Rs307.10 per US dollar in the first week of September last year.
Tresmark, a treasury firm, in its latest weekly commentary on Saturday said the Pakistani rupee would remain stable till end of current fiscal year on June 30, 2024, moving in a narrow band of Rs277-280 per US dollar in the short-run.

1,Most-wanted TTP commander killed in Khyber,Two terrorists neutralised in N Waziristan encounter,"A most-wanted commander of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was among three terrorists killed in two separate encounters with the security forces in the Khyber and North Waziristan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday.
TTP commander, identified as Hazrat Ali alias Gagga, was killed in a ground offense  by the military in the Tirah Valley of the Khyber district. The operation is aimed at eliminating the remnants of the Lashkar-e-Islam outfit, who trying to settle in the Tirah Valley, while coming from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Lashkar-e-Islam was led by Mangal Bagh, who was later killed in a bomb blast in Afghanistan over three years ago. Gagga was stated to the main operational commander of the terrorist outfit, which had sided the TTP.
Earlier, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that two terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire between the security forces and terrorists in the North Waziristan district in the night between April 6 and 7.
According to the media wing of the military, security forces effectively engaged terrorists’ location as a result of which “two terrorists were sent to hell” and weapons and explosives were recovered from them.

A “sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” the military’s media wing concluded.
Terrorist violence continues unabated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the regions near the border with Afghanistan. On Saturday that at least a dozen terrorists were eliminated in intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in the northwest and southwest of the country.
Security forces killed eight terrorists in Dera Ismail Khan district during an intense exchange of fire. According to the ISPR, the terrorists were engaged in various criminal activities, including attacks on security forces and deliberate targeting of innocent civilians.
Two more terrorists were killed in another IBO in North Waziristan district, the ISPR said. A third IBO was launched in Panjgur district of Balochistan and two terrorists identified as Asad and Hasrat, were killed, according to the ISPR.
Also on Saturday, a senior police official and his two guards were martyred in an ambush in the southern Lakki Marwat district. Gunmen ambushed the vehicle of DSP Gul Muhammad Khan near Manjiwala Chowk on a link road of Indus Highway with automatic weapons late on Friday night.
A spokesperson said that DSP Khan and Constable Naseem Gul succumbed to their injuries en route to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Sarai Naurang, while Constable Salamat died while being driven to Peshawar for treatment of his life-threatening wounds.

2,TTP and Daesh equated as equal threats,Islamabad tells international interlocutors there is no distinction between the two banned terror outfits,"Pakistan has been telling the international interlocutors that there is no distinction between the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Daesh in an effort to galvanise support for exerting pressure on the Afghan Taliban government.
Many countries in the region and beyond consider Daesh as an immediate threat while they view the TTP as Pakistan’s problem. This view held by certain countries is making it difficult for Islamabad to garner the kind of support it needed against the TTP.
Against the backdrop of ongoing surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan, authorities are briefing key stakeholders about the TTP posing a threat to their interests. One of the arguments Pakistan is making with those countries is that both the TTP and Daesh are the same.

“They are working in tandem. Don’t draw a distinction between the two,” said a source familiar with backdoor efforts to garner support against the Taliban regime. A diplomatic source also confirmed to The Express Tribune that they were recently briefed by Pakistani officials about the likely nexus between the TTP and Daesh.
The purpose behind Pakistan’s latest push is to make the international community realise that the TTP is as dangerous as Daesh. Pakistan is hoping that the international community would not turn a blind eye towards the activities of the TTP.
According to sources, Pakistan wants the international players to treat the TTP threat the same way as they are in the case of Daesh. Daesh took responsibility for major terrorist attacks not just in Pakistan, Iran and now in Russia.

There are fears that Daesh could replicate Moscow-style attacks in other countries. The US intelligence agencies, according to American media reports, warned of a potential Daesh attack in the US. Many countries were briefed by Pakistan about the close working relationship between the TTP and Daesh.
The terrorist outfit first emerged on the scene in Afghanistan in 2015. Daesh’s Afghan chapter was set up mostly by terrorists, who were previously part of the TTP and its affiliates. With the latest diplomatic manoeuvres, Pakistan is trying to remind the world that Afghanistan is once again becoming a hub of terrorists.
Pakistan’s efforts met some success at the recent meeting of National Security Advisers from Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member countries. The meeting was hosted by Kazakhstan, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the nine-member security bloc, comprising China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, India and certain Central Asian states.
The SCO in its joint statement expressed concerns over the presence of international terrorist outfits and their leaders in Afghanistan. It asked the Afghan Taliban government to fulfil the promises made with the international community.

3,Vehicle carrying Chinese engineers was not bulletproof: report,Preliminary report reveals female engineer among Chinese nationals killed in Bisham attack,"The vehicle transporting five Chinese nationals, who tragically lost their lives in last month's Bisham attack, was not equipped with bulletproof and bombproof features, according to a report based on preliminary examination.
The findings from the report state that the vehicle transporting the foreign engineers was not up-armoured and lacked protection against bullets or explosions.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa police has submitted a second report to the federal government, shedding light on the suicide attack targeting Chinese engineers in Bisham. Among the deceased victims was a female engineer.
According to the report, authorities have collected remnants of the vehicle used by the assailant to strike the Chinese convoy at the incident site, situated approximately six and 77 kilometres away from Bisham police station and Dasu dam, respectively.
The bus involved in the attack was found to be 15 feet distant from another bus, and it plunged 300 feet deep as a result of the suicide blast impact.All buses within the Chinese convoy were reportedly outfitted with closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV), and pieces of the attacker's vehicle have been recovered.
The development came a day after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered action against five officials over their “negligence” in light of an inquiry report on the suicide attack on March 26.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif instructed a thorough joint investigation into the Bisham terrorist attack. A joint investigation team was formed to probe the attack.

Later, the premier decided that he would review the meetings conducted regarding the security situation in the country in general and the security of the Chinese nationals working on different projects across the country, in particular, every month.
Hundreds of Chinese people are employed at the Dasu and Diamer Bhasha dam construction sites.
Operations by Power China have resumed at Diamer Bhasha. However, the China Gezhouba Group Company’s operations at Dasu remain suspended.
This was not the first instance of Chinese nationals facing danger in the region. In mid-2021, a devastating suicide car bombing targeted a bus convoy transporting Chinese engineers working on a major hydropower project, killing nine Chinese nationals and three local workers.
Pakistan hosts thousands of Chinese engineers and labourers, many of whom are engaged in projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), an integral component of Beijing's expansive Belt and Road Initiative.
Also last month, militants attacked Balochistan’s strategic Gwadar port, which China is developing as part of CPEC. All eight militants and two Pakistani soldiers were killed in the attack.
The second attack, on a naval base in Balochistan’s Turbat region, took place the following week, in which one Pakistani paramilitary soldier and five militants were killed.
In August 2023, militants launched an attack on a Pakistani military convoy near Gwadar while escorting a group of Chinese nationals to a construction site. The Pakistan army reported that two militants were neutralised, with no casualties among military personnel or civilians.
