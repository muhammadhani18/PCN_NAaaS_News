0,Video recording of drug raids by police made mandatory,Move seen as a step towards enhanced transparency,"Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh of Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Bahawalpur Bench has issued a directive mandating the video recording of all police operations, particularly those involving the recovery of narcotics, without exception.
This significant ruling came during a hearing concerning a post-arrest bail petition.
The directive underscores the importance of adhering to sections 27 and 33(4) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA), which require the video documentation of recovery proceedings unless extraordinary circumstances prevent it. Justice Sheikh emphasised the necessity for police officials to document specific reasons in case diaries if video recording is not feasible.
Additionally, Justice Sheikh has instructed all special courts to ensure strict compliance with the legislative provisions outlined in the CNSA. He highlighted that these regulations, which often go overlooked, mandate the production of recovered narcotics before the court during remand proceedings.
The ruling was made during a bail hearing for Kousar Bibi, a petitioner implicated in a narcotics-related case.
Justice Sheikh granted bail upon the condition of furnishing bail bonds worth Rs500,000, along with two sureties, to the satisfaction of the trial court.
In his detailed judgment, Justice Sheikh stressed the importance of upholding human rights, due process, transparency, and accountability while combating drug trafficking and abuse.
He noted that video recording of police operations in narcotics cases serves as a vital tool in promoting transparency, supporting criminal investigations, and safeguarding individual liberties. However, Justice Sheikh acknowledged the challenges associated with the use of videography, including privacy concerns and logistical issues. He emphasised the need for clear policies and procedures to address these challenges effectively.
The implementation of this directive is expected to enhance the credibility of law enforcement agencies.
