1,Ten Hag expects United to seal top-four spot despite Brighton loss,Alexis Mac Allister’s stoppage-time penalty gives Brighton a 1-0 win against United.,"LONDON: Erik ten Hag insists Manchester United’s last-gasp defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion will not derail their bid to qualify for the Champions League.
Alexis Mac Allister’s stoppage-time penalty gave Brighton a 1-0 win against United on Thursday.
The defeat left United in fourth place on 63 points and now just four points above fifth-placed Liverpool, although they hold a vital game in hand over Jurgen Klopp’s men.
United have proven adept at recovering from setbacks this season and Ten Hag is confident they will show that determined streak again as they look wrap up a top four finish in the Premier League.
“We have every time in this season when we had a defeat, we bounce back. So, I count on my players, I count on my team. We have to do it again,” Ten Hag said ahead of Sunday’s trip to West Ham United.
“There is no time to stay in this disappointment, so in one hour we go onto the game against West Ham United. All focus on that. We prepare for them, we make a good plan, the players have to take responsibility and they will do. I count on them.
“They have to do it and they can do it because we have the evidence in the season. Every time when we had disappointments, they bounce back.”
Ten Hag is adamant there is no reason to panic about United’s top four hopes, despite Liverpool’s winning run coming just in time to put them back in the hunt.
“We had a quite good run from the last five, four wins and a draw before Brighton,” he said. “We have everything in our hands, so we have to focus on our performance. I trust my players, so I am quite convinced about that.”
United haven’t won the Champions League since 2008 and last appeared in the final in 2011. But the tournament is part of the club’s DNA and Ten Hag is well aware how important it is to feature in Europe’s elite club competition.
“Manchester United, of course, we need to be there in the Champions League,” he said. “We want to be there because we want to challenge with the best teams in the world, so we do everything that’s in our power to get that done. I think it is always vital that we have to be in the Champions League. We do everything to get there.”
Ten Hag, however stressed his side need to be more clinical in front of goal and maintain their focus for a full 90 minutes after they squandered a few chances before conceding late at Brighton.
United and Brighton both had opportunities early in the first half, with Antony firing wide in the second minute before Kaoru Mitoma hammered a fierce shot straight into the face of David De Gea.
However, the deadlock was not broken until the ninth minute of stoppage time, when MacAllister scored from the spot after Luke Shaw had handled the ball in the box.
“Every defeat is a disappointment but in the end when you lose in the last second, that is of course annoying,” Ten Hag said. “And I think the first minutes sum everything up. We create a good chance, we were not clinical enough, then in the attack after we concede a big chance by a giveaway from us, the ball on the head for David.
“And in the end, we also gave away the goal and that’s annoying. If you can’t win because you don’t finish your opportunities then don’t lose. We have to be more clinical and stay focused until the end of the game.”

2,Kenya bids to host Diamond League meet,NAIROBI: Kenya is hoping to build on its successful hosting of the World Athletics Intercontinental Tour series by...,"NAIROBI: Kenya is hoping to build on its successful hosting of the World Athletics Intercontinental Tour series by bidding for the premier Diamond League meeting, officials said on Friday.
Rabat is currently the only African city to stage the Diamond League — track and field’s elite one-day series which features 14 host cities in four continents.
Athletics Kenya chief Jackson Tuwei said the country had made an application to World Athletics for the upgrade of the second-tier Intercontinental Tour series, whose fourth edition will be held in Nai­robi on May 13, to beco­me a Diamond League meet.
“We have applied to World Athletics to upgrade the Kip Keino classic continental Tour series to become a Diamond League meet since there’s only one African country host of Rabat, Morocco,” Tuwei told reporters.
“Our request is being considered, and maybe the next big athletics meeting to be held here in Nairobi will have the Diamond League status.” The Afri­can 100m record by Kenyan sprint star Ferdi­nand Omanyala and several world leading-times have been set at the Kip Keino classic since it was launched in October 2020.
The women’s world 100m champion, Jamaica’s Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who thrilled the Kenyan crowd with 10.67sec victory a year ago will return to defend her title on May 13.
Her American rival Sha’Carri Richardson is expected to run in the 200 metres in her first outing in Kenya after pulling out of last year’s event.

3,Champions Napoli return home as city revels in title hangover,"NAPLES: Napoli’s champions returned home Friday after winning their first Serie A title in 33 years, greeted by...","NAPLES: Napoli’s champions returned home Friday after winning their first Serie A title in 33 years, greeted by hundreds of jubilant fans following a raucous night of partying in Naples. 
The returning heroes who brought Napoli its third Scudetto in its history on Thursday night arrived by plane from Udine at the nearby Grazzanise Air Base, where fans wearing “Champions of Italy” T-shirts were on hand to greet them. 
Waving blue-and-white flags, singing songs and honking horns, ecstatic fans went wild at the sight of the players’ white bus returning to the team’s training centre in Castel Volturno, northwest of Naples. 
But the wait was in vain as the players went straight home from the airport. They are sure to receive a hero’s welcome at Sunday’s home match with Fiore­ntina, and another party is being planned in the city at the end of the championship on June 4. 
Naples had been abuzz all day, still giddy with joy after nearly all-night celebrations, a party marred, however, by one death and hundreds of injuries.   
Mass street partying, punctuated by fireworks, flares, horns and firecrackers, began late on Thursday after the Napoli team secured the title with a 1-1 draw away at Udinese in northeast Italy, their first since the era of Diego Maradona, who led the team to victory in 1987 and 1990.    
Throughout the night, Naples’ narrow streets were filled with the sounds of cheering, cars and scooters honking their horns, their passengers waving flags and banners.    
Fans had prepared for weeks to celebrate, as Napoli built up an increasingly unbeatable lead against nearest-placed rivals Lazio.    
Blue flags and bunting adorned every possible surface of the city centre, as did images of Maradona and star striker Victor Osimhen, whose goal on Thursday night pushed southern Italy’s biggest club over the line.    
Naples health authorities said 203 people accessed emergency services overnight, including 22 with “red-level” critical injuries and 75 with “yellow-level” serious but not life-threatening conditions.    
Health service spokesperson Anna Tagliaferri said the figure was not unusually high, with any of Naples’ larger hospitals routinely handling as many as 200 emergency room cases on a “normal” day.    
A 26-year-old man fromgunshot wounds but authorities linked it to score-settling within the local Cam­orra mafia. Naples Prefect Claudio Palomba told RAI public radio the incident had “nothing to do with the [football] celebrations”.    
Some in Naples saw the side’s runaway title triumph with five games still to play as a sign of resurgence in Italy’s impoverished south after decades of dominance — not just in sporting terms — by the wealthier north.    
“A Scudetto won by Napoli is not like a Scudetto won by any other team”, best-selling true crime author and club supporter Roberto Saviano wrote in the Corriere della Sera newspaper, hailing “a miracle”.    
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni joined the chorus of congratulations for the club. “Thirty-three years after the last Scudetto, Napoli are back as champions of Italy. Congratulations to the whole team, to coach Spalletti and to the entire club for all their efforts and for this well-deserved result,” Meloni wrote on Twitter.    
Napoli’s victory made the front pages of all Italy’s major newspapers on Friday, while the local Il Mattino ran a bumper special edition under the headline: “Naples Sings”.    
“Under the sign of King Diego” read another of its headlines, demonstrating the enduring love for the Argentine great in this city.    
Maradona, who died in 2020 at age 60, led Napoli to their first two titles earning the eternal adoration of the club’s fans.    
Many of those celebrating — including coach Luciano Spalletti — described how Maradona was watching over the team.    
“They [the fans] have seen great coaches and great players, they’re supporters who watched Maradona play, and probably some kind of protection from him has led to this result,” coach Spalletti, who broke down in tears after his side claimed the title, told DAZN after the match.    
“Seeing the Partenopei smiling and happy is the biggest emotion for me. They are the ones who transmit their happiness. There are people here who will now be able to overcome difficult moments in their lives because they remember this moment. These people deserve all the joy.”    
Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis said that the title was just the beginning for the club he took from bankruptcy to the top of the Italian game.    
Film mogul De Laurentiis took control of Napoli in 2004 when the club were forced to restart from the third tier and since then has made Napoli consistently one of the best teams in Italy while keeping the club’s finances in decent shape.    
“This is a starting point, not an ending,” said De Laurentiis in a packed Stadio Maradona in Naples after his club secured the Scudetto. “We are going to go again with [coach Luciano] Spalletti. It’s a title that we have built towards over the years.”    
Napoli started the season in turmoil as fans were in revolt against club De Laurentiis after key players including supporter favourite Kalidou Koulibaly left or were sold.    
However a clutch of new arrivals, including Nigerian Osimhen and Georgian winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, made an instant impact and Napoli charged almost unopposed to a historic Scudetto which puts the current crop alongside the teams led to two titles by Maradona.    
“It is an amazing feeling, we have waited so many years for this moment. To be able to deliver the Scudetto to the Neapolitans is something that we will never forget in a hurry and will continue to live in our hearts for the rest of our lives,” Osimhen said to DAZN.    
“I’m happy for all Neapolitans... now we’re going to celebrate in front of our own fans and enjoy the moment for life. We were underdogs at the start of the season, not so many people believed in us. This team stuck together... we believed from the start of the season that we had a great squad that we could deliver the Scudetto. Now we have realised this dream.”

An estimated crowd of 55,000 is expected to pack the Akron Stadium for an open-air championship bout that is boxing icon Alvarez’s first fight in Mexico in nearly 12 years.
Alvarez (58-2-2, 39 knockouts) is the overwhelming favourite to retain his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO belts against mandatory challenger Ryder (32-5, 18 knockouts) in a fight scheduled to coincide with Mexico’s Cinco de Mayo national holiday weekend.
The ringmaster is reveling in the opportunity to fight before fans in Guadalajara, where as a child he sold ice cream out of a van alongside his father before going on to become a boxing superstar.
“I feel very proud and happy to bring this fight to Guadalajara and give the people some of the experience I have in other places as the best in the world,” Alvarez told reporters recently.
“It’s the perfect time. I wanted to fight in Guadalajara, but I think this is the perfect moment, the perfect fight to bring to Guadalajara.”

5,BFAME championship set to start today,"Besides hosts Pakistan, teams from India, Jordan, Bangladesh, Palestine and the UAE are participating in the championship.","LAHORE:  Players from six countries have arrived in Lahore to participate in the 22nd Bridge Federation of Asia and Middle East (BFAME) Championship starting here at a local hotel on Saturday.
Besides hosts Pakistan, teams from India, Jordan, Bangladesh, Palestine and the United Arab Emirates are participating in the championship.
On Friday, a Friendship Open Pairs contest was held while a captains’ meeting was also arranged.
An opening ceremony of the event, attended by Federal Inter-provincial Minis­ter Ehsanur Rehman Mazari, BFAME president Bahajat Al Majali, Pakistan Bridge Federation president Mubashar Lucman and secretary Ehsan Qadir, was held.
Later addressing a press conference jointly alongside Majali, Indian captain Ranjan Bhattacharya said his team were upbeat to do well and qualify for the World Cup.
“We are thankful to both Indian and Pakistani governments for helping us arrive in Pakistan,” Bhattacharya said.
“Yes, the [political] history of both the countries has had [several] issues but we successfully convinced our government that India’s participation is essential as it is a qualifying round for the World Cup.”
Ranjan thanked the PBF for giving a warm welcome to the Indian squad at Wagah Border and hospitality in Lahore.
Speaking on the occasion, Majali said 18 players each from five countries and 24 from Pakistan, were participating in the championship.
“Syria, Sri Lanka and Bahrain could not feature in the championship due to different reasons and Saudi Arabia was also to participate but they could not reach,” Majali added.
“Events [at the BFAME championship] will be held in four categories including Open, Woman, Seniors and Mixed Team. The top two teams of each category will qualify for the World Cup to be held in Morocco in September this year.”
Meanwhile, India, Pakistan and Jordan are participating in all four categories. The UAE is also contesting in three categories while Bangladesh and Palestine are featuring in only one category apiece.
On Saturday, three rounds will be held in each category.

6,Sabalenka plots Swiatek revenge in Madrid final,MADRID: Aryna Sabalenka gave herself an early birthday gift by easing into the Madrid Open final for the second time...,"MADRID: Aryna Sabalenka gave herself an early birthday gift by easing into the Madrid Open final for the second time in three years on Thursday and then plotted revenge on world number one Iga Swiatek. 
The world number two turns 25 on Friday and the Belarusian celebrated in style by breezing past Greek world number nine Maria Sakkari, 6-4, 6-1. She won an impressive 70.7% of her first serve points and saved five of six break points while sending down four aces against Sakkari. 
Sabalenka, the 2021 champion in Madrid, will face Swiatek in Saturday’s championship match after the French and US Open winner swept aside 13th-ranked Veronika Kudermetova 6-1, 6-1. 
Reigning Australian Open champion Sabalenka will be chasing a fifth WTA 1000 title, a 13th career title overall and third in 2023. 
She will have the opportunity to avenge her straight-sets defeat to Swiatek in last month’s Stuttgart championship match. 
“I really want this revenge,” she said. “It would be really great to be able to defeat a player like Iga on clay. In Stuttgart, I was rushing on the short balls, I tried too hard for the winning shot. This time, I played with more patience and waited for the right ball to finish the point.” 
Top seed Swiatek enjoys a 5-2 win-loss record against Sabalenka, having also won the pair’s three previous clay-court meetings. 
The Pole marched into her maiden final in Madrid in a clinical display against the 12th seed Kudermetova, impr­oving her head-to-head record against the Russian to 4-0. 
It will be the third time in the last 40 years that the world top two will meet twice in the same season on clay after Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova in 2013, and Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert back in 1984. 
In men’s singles, world number five Stefanos Tsitsipas cra­s­hed out following a 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 6-3 defeat by Ger­many’s lucky loser Jan-Len­nard Struff in the quarter-finals. 
In-form Struff will next face qualifier Aslan Karatsev as both reached their first Masters 1000 semi-final, the Russian doing so by beating China’s Zhang Zhizhen 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 earlier on Thursday.

7,Messi offers apology for Saudi trip after being suspended by PSG,PSG boss Christophe Galtier says he had nothing to do with the club’s decision to suspend Messi.,"PARIS: Lionel Messi apologised to Paris St Germain and his teammates on Friday after being suspended for making an unauthorized trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this week and missing a training session as a result.
French media reported that Argentina’s World Cup-winning captain was suspended for two weeks after he travelled to Saudi Arabia without PSG’s permission to fulfil commitments as part of a contract with the country’s tourist office when he was supposed to train with the squad the day after the Ligue 1 leaders’ 3-1 defeat at home to Lorient on Sunday.
“I sincerely believed that I would have the day off after the game as had been happening in previous weeks. I had this trip organised and I couldn’t cancel it, I had already cancelled it before,” Messi said in a video posted on Instagram to his 458 million followers.
“I apologise to my teammates and I’m waiting for what the club wants to do with me,” added the Argentina forward.
The affair has made it increasingly unlikely that Messi will remain at PSG beyond this season, when his two-year contract with the club expires.
A source with knowledge of the disciplinary procedure told AFP that Messi would be sidelined for “several days”, and he is therefore set to play no part in PSG’s match against Troyes this weekend in Ligue 1.
Various media in France said he would be suspended for two weeks, although AFP has not been able to confirm those reports.
PSG boss Christophe Galtier said earlier on Friday that he had nothing to do with the club’s decision to suspend Messi as they look to keep their Ligue 1 lead intact.
“We’ll see when Leo returns, we’ll see what happens. Obviously, there will be discussions with the entire club, but also with Leo,” Galtier had said at a press conference when asked if Messi would play for the team again.
Galtier also said that the decision to suspend the 35-year-old Messi was not his to take in the first place. “It wasn’t my decision to take. I was informed of the decision and I defer to it,” he insisted.
PSG, who are five points clear of Olympique de Marseille at the top of Ligue 1, will have just four more matches remaining this season following their game against Troyes.
Messi has received a formal offer to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal next season, a source close to Argentina’s captain told Reuters, with a contract renewal at PSG not on the cards for the World Cup winner who turns 36 next month.
The oil-rich nation appointed Messi its tourism ambassador last year and he visited Jeddah in May 2022.
He returned in January to play a friendly match with PSG against a team of Saudi League stars, when he faced great rival Cristiano Ronaldo.
Al Hilal coach Ramon Diaz, however, refused to be drawn on claims the Saudi club are attempting to sign Messi as they are focused on their clash with Urawa Red Diamonds in the second leg of the Asian Champions League final.

8,"Record-breaking Babar gives Pakistan 4-0 lead, top ODI ranking",KARACHI: Babar Azam is a gift that keeps giving. And the Pakistan skipper gave another during the fourth One-day...,"KARACHI: Babar Azam is a gift that keeps giving. And the Pakistan skipper gave another during the fourth One-day International against New Zealand here at the National Bank Stadium on Friday.
Arriving onto the crease after Fakhar Zaman’s early departure for his 97th ODI innings, Babar needed just 19 runs to become the fastest-ever to reach 5000 runs in the format.
As anyone would expect from a batter of his stature, he reached the milestone on his 26th ball, beating South African Hashim Amla by four innings.
The right-hander registered his 27th ODI half-century 32 deliveries later and turned it into his 18th century on his 113th ball — becoming the quickest batter to score as many tons and celebrating it with the trademark leap and roar before going down in prostration.
Thanks to a swashbuckling show by the Pakistan lower middle-order, Babar’s knock of 107 off 117 balls would go on to give Pakistan a 102-run win, a 4-0 lead in the series and the number one spot in the ICC ODI Rankings — to sustain which Pakistan need to complete a whitewash over the second-string Black Caps.
Although he was the main feature of the match, Babar’s role was more of an anchor as others around him shone in his limelight, celebrating their captain’s milestones
Pakistan, however, changed gears only after Shan Masood (44) — coming in for Imam-ul-Haq — and Mohammad Rizwan (24 off 28) departed. It were Babar and Agha Salman who upped the ante after the 30th over and the pair shared five boundaries between them in 15 balls as the former took Pakistan past 200 with a pull off leg-spinner Ish Sodhi for four.
Salman reached his second ODI half century in 40 balls and his 100-run partnership with Babar with a towering six over long-off off off-spinner Cole McConchie in the 40th over, which he wrapped up with an even better hit down the ground for six more.
It was an acrobatic effort by Henry off his own bowling in the next over as the right-armer’s bouncer forced Salman (58 off 46, fours fours and two sixes) to push the ball into the air for the bowler to dive and grab it safely, ending the batter’s 100-ball 117 run partnership with Babar.

As anticipation for Babar’s century rose and so did chants for him, the incoming Iftikhar Ahmed — playing in place of Mohammad Nawaz — shifted the spotlight off his captain for a while with three consecutive fours off Tickner in the 46th over just before Babar reached the milestone, triggering celebrations among the sparse crowd.
Iftikhar, however, skied another attempt to go big two balls later to depart at 28 off 22. Babar followed after smashing Ben Lister down the ground for his last boundary as he found McConchie at deep midwicket.
Their captain’s departure gave way to Shaheen Shah Afridi and Mohammad Haris — replacing Abdulah Shafique — to launch their own fireworks, which featured three huge sixes and a four by the former in the final over of the innings by Tickner as the duo partnered up to score 38 runs in the last two overs to take Pakistan to 334-6.
The scoreboard pressure was on New Zealand from the start of their pursuit of the mammoth target. New Zealand opener Tom Blundell pushed far to ease it, with an early onslaught against the Pakistan pacers, only to see himself and his partner Will Young back in the dressing room with their team reeling at 46-2 by the end of the ninth over.
Apart from an 83-run partnership off 103 balls between New Zealand captain Tom Latham (60) and Daryl Mitchell (34), only Mark Chapman’s onslaught of 46 posed some kind of threat towards Pakistan’s ambitions for a whitewash.
After a thick edge off Mitchell’s bat ended up in Shaheen’s hands at short third-man to give leg-spinner Usama Mir — replacing Shadab Khan — his first wicket, Chapman launched off-spinner Iftikhar over extra-cover for a six to start off his fireworks. The left-hander hit a six and four off Salman’s off-break in the next over and targeted Iftikhar again for a similar result.
Sensing danger, stand-in captain Rizwan — with Babar off the field due to a suspected hand injury — brought pacers back into the attack, which slowed New Zealand down again and forced Latham to falter as the southpaw got a faint edge off Shaheen for Rizwan to take an easy catch behind the wickets in the 34th over.
As the asking rate rose, New Zealand found themselves stuck in a shell with Usama returning two overs later to clean up Chapman and Haris Rauf – back into the line-up in place of Naseem Shah — shattering Jimmy Neesham’s stumps to effectively wrap up the proceedings.
Usama went on to get rid of the New Zealand tail to finished with figures of 4-43 in 10 overs before Mohammad Wasim (3-40), who had dismissed Blundell and McConchie earlier, finished things off with Blair Tickner’s wicket.


RECORD-BREAKER: Pakistan captain Babar Azam roars in celebration after completing century in the fourth One-Day International against New Zealand at the National Bank Stadium, Karachi, on Friday. Babar became the fastest batter to complete 5,000 runs in the format, with the 28-year-old beating Hashim Amla’s record. Babar’s ton and 58 from Agha Salman helped Pakistan amass 334-6 before spinner Usama Mir picked 4-43 as they dismissed New Zealand for 232 to take a 4-0 lead.—AFP

9,"KL Rahul to undergo surgery, ruled out of WTC final","""It’s a tough call to make, but I know it’s the right one to ensure a full recovery,"" Rahul says.","NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul has been ruled out of the rest of the Indian Premier League (IPL) season and India’s World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia after he said on Friday he would undergo surgery on his thigh.
The 31-year-old got injured in his last match against Royal Challengers Bangalore earlier this week, tearing a tendon in his right leg while fielding, and had to be helped off the ground.
He could not open Lucknow’s innings in the run-chase but came out to bat at number 11. However, he could not score off the three deliveries he faced in the penultimate over.
“After careful consideration and consultation with the medical team, it’s been concluded that I’ll be undergoing a surgery on my thigh shortly,” Rahul wrote on Instagram.

“I’ll be cheering for them [Lucknow] from the sidelines with all of you, watching every game.”
Lucknow are second in the IPL standings with 11 points, one behind leaders Gujarat Titans who have a game in hand.
The surgery will also rule Rahul out of the WTC final against Australia at the Oval from June 7-11. He was named in the squad announced last month.
“Absolutely gutted that I won’t be at the Oval next month with Team India,” he added.  “I’ll do everything I can to get back in blue and help my country. That has always been my focus and priority.”

10,Australia to tour SA for white ball series,"CAPE TOWN: Australia travel to South Africa for an eight-match white-ball tour this year, including three T20 ...","CAPE TOWN: Australia travel to South Africa for an eight-match white-ball tour this year, including three T20 matches and five One-day Internationals in preparation for this year’s 50-over World Cup in India, officials confirmed on Friday.
The T20 fixtures will all be played at Kingsmead in the coastal city of Durban between Aug 30 and Sept 3. The tour then moves to the Highveld for the five-match ODI series over Sept 7-17. The first two games will be in Bloemfontein, followed by matches in Potchefstroom, Pretoria and Johannesburg.
It is the first white-ball tour to the country by Australia since 2020 and follows South Africa’s withdrawal from an ODI series in Australia last January, when they prioritised the launch of their domestic T20 league.
Having forfeited that series, South Africa have yet to seal their place at the World Cup in October but will do so if Ireland fail to complete a clean-sweep of their three-match series against Bangladesh, which starts in Chelmsford next week.
If the Irish do book their place at the expense of South Africa, the latter will suffer the embarrassment of having to go through the final round of qualifiers in Zimbabwe next month.
Tour schedule:
Aug 30: First T20, Durban
Sept 1: Second T20, Durban
Sept 3: Third T20, Durban
Sept 7: First ODI, Bloemfontein
Sept 9: Second ODI, Bloemfontein
Sept 12: Third ODI, Potchefstroom
Sept 15: Fourth ODI, Pretoria
Sept 17: Fifth ODI, Johannesburg.

11,Sciver-Brunt quits international cricket,LONDON: Katherine Sciver-Brunt retired from international cricket on Friday after a superb 19-year career in which...,"LONDON: Katherine Sciver-Brunt retired from international cricket on Friday after a superb 19-year career in which she took more wickets than any other woman for England.
Sciver-Brunt, who made her international debut in 2004, amassed 335 wickets in 267 appearances for England.
The fast bowler helped Eng­land’s women to three Ashes series victories and three World Cup wins, two coming in ODIs and one in T20s.
Only India’s Jhulan Gosw­ami (355) has more dismissals than Sciver-Brunt in all women’s international formats.
Sciver-Brunt, 37, quit playing Tests last year and also stepped away from ODIs.
She has now elected to walk away from England altogether, despite contemplating staying on for the T20 portion of this summer’s multi-format Ashes series.
“Well here I am, 19 years later, at the end of my international journey,” she said.  “I thought I’d never be able to reach this decision but I have and it’s been the hardest one of my life.
“I never had any dreams or aspirations to do what I’ve done, I only ever wished to make my family proud of me. And what I’ve achieved has gone way beyond that.”
Sciver-Brunt’s last England appearance came in the T20 World Cup semi-final defeat against hosts South Africa in February.
“I have so much to be thankful for, cricket has given me a purpose, a sense of belonging, security, many golden memories and best friends that will last a lifetime,” Sciver-Brunt added.
“It has been a huge honour representing England for so long and I’d like to thank all of the England cricket family past and present for making my time a special one.”
She also paid tribute to her partner Nat Sciver-Brunt, the England all-rounder, saying:  “Of the trophies and titles I could have wished to achieve, I have reached them all, but my greatest achievement is the happiness that I have found in Nat.” Clare Connor, the managing director of England women’s cricket, said Sciver-Brunt bowed out of the international game as a  “legend of our sport”.
“Katherine has done so much for the game of cricket and for women’s cricket in particular,” said Connor, a former England captain.
“She has been an unbelievable role-model, giving us everything she has for nearly 20 years.
“Katherine began her career in a completely different era from the one we are in now and we owe her a debt of gratitude for the part she has played in progressing our game, raising standards and bringing a new audience to women’s cricket.
“She is quite simply a legend of our sport.”
Sciver-Brunt, often considered a bowling all-rounder after amassing 1,864 international runs, had already stepped away from regional cricket but will play one more season in The Hundred.
