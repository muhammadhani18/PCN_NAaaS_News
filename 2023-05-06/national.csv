0,Nadra takes criminal action over access to data of army chief’s family,"Elements on whose behest the breach took place are also being acted against, after sacking of six employees, says source.","ISLAMABAD: The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) has initiated criminal proceedings against its employees behind the saga involving unauthorised access to data of the family of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir.
An informed source told Dawn that the elements on whose behest the breach took place were also being acted against. As many as six Nadra employees had been terminated from service for illegally accessing COAS’ family’s record, following four separate inquiries ordered by Nadra Chairman Tariq Malik on Dec 23, 2022, and March 2, 2023, the source disclosed.
A joint probe conducted by Nadra and a sensitive security agency in December last year discovered that Farooq Ahmed, a junior executive employee working on a project of the Benazir Income Support Programme, was the first person to have unlawfully accessed the data in question.
The high-powered inquiry committee on the direction of the incumbent chairman expanded the scope of the investigation by technically analysing logins, user IDs, system logs and IP addresses that were intact, reflecting the strength of the authority’s database.
This led to the identification of a total of 10 employees who illegally accessed record of the army chief’s family. After a fact-finding inquiry, the suspects were cross-examined and a detailed probe was launched.

Elements on whose behest the breach took place are also being acted against, after sacking of six employees

Hence, a charge sheet into the imputations of accessing COAS family’s data unauthorisedly and illegally was subsequently issued to the accused employees on Jan 6. As a result, in two inquiries the committee found six officials responsible. He said a committee imposed a major penalty of termination from service under the Government Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules 1973 on these six employees.
Data security
He said Nadra introduced a number of additional security protocols to check on its own employees’ behaviour. A few months ago, an additional service, ‘Ijazat Aap Ki’, was introduced to roll out a consent regime that informs citizens and asks for their permission in form of an OTP (one-time password) if their personal data is accessed remotely.
He said Artificial Intelligence-based log access reviews now send alerts of suspicious activities of employees. Mr Malik is the first chairman who had taken unprecedented measures to secure data and focus on privacy of citizen’s personal data.
Meanwhile, in a message to Nadra employees, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the Nadra chairman has referred to various steps taken for their welfare, including a 65 per cent raise in salaries and a policy to reward those showing remarkable performance.
He said people trusted Nadra, which was a custodian of their personal and family information. He said there would be zero tolerance for any breach, adding that an AI-based system had been put in place and all possible steps had been taken to safeguard the public data.
Referring to some guiding principles, the chairman said no Nadra employee was authorised to use logins of any other colleague, no data entry operator had the permission to access personal data of any citizen and biometric of a family member was an essential requirement to access anybody’s family tree.
He said a comprehensive monitoring system was being developed to check any possible violation and as many as 131 had so far been dismissed in its light.
He made it clear that unauthorised access to somebody’s data was a grave violation of the law and under Section 28 of the act may entail imprisonment of up to five years, a fine up to Rs1 million or both.
He also alluded in the letter towards the incident involving data of COAS’ family and said six officials down from the level of a junior executive to director have been removed from service and criminal case against them were being filed.
He urged the employees to keep in mind the fundamental principle that be it a common citizen or an important office holder, the secrecy and security of their data should be the foremost priority.
He asked them not only to discharge their duties with honesty, but also to keep a vigilant eye on suspected individuals, and to inform their seniors in case somebody persuades them to access personal data of a citizen.

1,Kurram tragedy victims buried amid protests,"All markets, bazaars, schools and courts also remained closed in the district.","KURRAM: Protests erupted in Parachinar on Friday after the burial of seven people, including teachers, who were killed by unidentified gunmen at a school on Thursday. The town remained closed to mourn the deaths.
Another teacher, who was killed before the mass shooting of teachers, was buried in Teri Mangal area of the district.
The protesters were also joined by teachers and hospital employees to condemn the incidents.
All markets, bazaars, schools and courts also remained closed in the district.
Female teachers in the Alizai area organised a pro­test to condemn the incident, demanding better security for teachers. They held up placards and banners, including ones that read “Protect the Teachers” and “It’s better to raise your voice than to carry the dead.”

2,"Hit streets today to support judiciary, Imran tells nation",Says people won’t allow rulers to defy SC order on Punjab polls.,"LAHORE: Amid the ongoing judiciary-executive tussle, PTI Chairman Imran Khan has made an impassioned appeal to the whole nation to come out of their homes on Saturday (today) to give a message to the ruling coalition, “its handlers” and state institutions that no one will tolerate violation of the Constitution and defiance of the Supreme Court’s order regarding holding of elections in Punjab on May 14.
Addressing the nation through a video link from his Zaman Park residence on Friday, the former prime minister said Pakistan was at its most sensitive juncture and the whole nation needed to get united to fight against “the mafia” to ensure that people get their fundamental rights.
He announced that the PTI would hold four rallies in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Peshawar on Saturday evening simultaneously to express solidarity with the Constitution, Supreme Court and chief justice of Pakistan.
Stating that he would himself lead the rally in Lahore (from Zaman Park to Lakshami Chowk), Mr Khan urged people across the country to come out of their homes at 5.30pm on Saturday and gather at designated places to tell the rulers and their handlers that they would not be allowed to flout the Constitution and usurp citizens’ fundamental rights.

Says people won’t allow rulers to defy SC order on Punjab polls

He said the PDM government had now made it clear that it was not ready to hold elections in Punjab on May 14, which would be a gross violation of the Constitution.
 


The former prime minister said the incumbent government had imposed the “might is right” law, adding that the judiciary was the last hope for the people of Pakistan.
Claiming that some 0.9 million people had already left the country, he said those who would live in this country must rise and defeat the “mafia sucking their resources and rights”.
The PTI chief said the government functionaries had launched a tirade against the judges for giving the May 14 election date and recalled how the Supreme Court was opened at midnight to take suo motu notice against his decision to dissolve the National Assembly and paved the way for Shehbaz Sharif to become prime minister. Despite that, he added, he never said anything against the judges.
On the other hand, he said, the same judges were being criticised by the PDM (Pakistan Democratic Movement) for acting within the ambit of the Constitution.
He alleged that the Sharif and Zardari families looted the country, shattered its economy and pushed people to face the cruelty of price hikes.
He added that Pakistan’s economy was growing in a robust manner and dollars inflow had increased, but then the economy shattered “in the absence of political stability because the incumbent government did not call elections despite commitments”.
Running video clips of several PDM leaders, Mr Khan said they were saying that the PTI should dissolve assemblies to get elections. “When the PTI dissolved Punjab and KP assemblies, the PDM government was crying that elections could not be held because the government had no funds and that there were security concerns,” he added.
The PTI chief said the government was now saying that it could hold elections in October, but not explaining what was its plan. “The government should explain its game plan that how it will be able to turn around the current situation by October,” he said.
Mr Khan said the PDM government was actually afraid of going to the polls because it could not face the people and had plans to crush the PTI and incarcerate him to get an open field in elections. “What if the government could not crush the PTI this year?”
He said the caretaker governments in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had completed their constitutional terms and needed to be demolished.
Meanwhile, a PTI delegation from Sindh called on party chief Imran Khan and briefed him on the “police excesses against PTI leaders and workers”, as well as the usurpation of fundamental rights of people at large.

3,FIA seeks Interpol help in hunt for Farhat Shahzadi,"LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has sought an Interpol red notice for the arrest of Farhat Shahzadi,...","LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has sought an Interpol red notice for the arrest of Farhat Shahzadi, known as Farah Khan, who has been facing money laundering charges at home.
In a letter to the Interpol director in Islamabad, the FIA has sought the red notice of “fugitive Farhat Shahzadi in FIR 04/23 of FIA anti-money laundering circle in Lahore.”
According to Interpol, a red notice is not an international arrest warrant but a request to law enforcement worldwide to “locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action”.
Several PML-N leaders, including some federal cabinet members, have been pushing the government to allow the FIA to bring back Ms Shahzadi to the country and make her face the cases filed against her. Ms Shahzadi is a close friend of Bushra Bibi, the wife of PTI chief Imran Khan.
PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif had called Ms Shahzadi Punjab’s “real chief minister” during the tenure of Usman Buzdar.
Ms Shahzadi earlier served legal notices on prime minister special assistant Attaullah Tarar for his “derogatory” remarks about her and against a Dubai-based businessman, a leading news channel and its anchor for alleging that she was involved in the sale of Toshakhana gifts.
Ms Shahzadi left the country days before Mr Khan’s ouster as prime minister through a no-confidence motion in April last year.
In its letter, the FIA said that it was investigating her on charges of laundering millions of rupees.
“On fearing that her heinous crime is likely to be exposed, Farhat Shahzadi alias Farah Gogi escaped to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on April 3, 2022,” it said. “She has been declared as proclaimed offender by the court of Mr Ghulam Murtaza Virk on March 14, 2023, by the issuance of a proclamation order (warrant).”
The investigation agency requested Interpol to get the approval of this request and send the process to its headquarters in the French city of Lyon for early issuance of the red notice.
The agency said that once Ms Shah­zadi’s red notice was issued, it would vigorously pursue her arrest abroad.
The FIA is also investigating Ms Shahzadi’s husband, Ahsan Jamil Gujjar, in the money laundering case. He is in the United States. Ms Shahzadi has also been said to have left the UAE and is residing either in the US along with her husband or in some other country.

4,"Centre, GB govt agree on wheat price hike",Subsidised wheat to be sold at Rs20 per kg in GB after Rs7.5 increase,"GILGIT: The Pakistan Demo­cratic Movement-led federal government and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led Gilgit-Baltistan government on Friday agreed to increase prices of subsidised wheat in the region.
The agreement was reached at a meeting held between Adviser to PM on Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Qamar Zaman Kaira and Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan in Islam­abad, said a press release of GB CM House released on Friday. 
Informed sources said the meeting decided to increase the subsidised wheat price in Gilgit-Baltistan by Rs7.50, to Rs20 per kg. 
The region’s cabinet would approve the decision to increase the price and the agreement will take effect from May 15. 

Subsidised wheat to be sold at Rs20 per kg in GB after Rs7.5 increase

For the release of funds for development, the federal government had demanded the GB government to increase the price of subsidised wheat in GB which the latter did and then federal government released Rs5 billion development funds, the press release said. 
Gilgit-Baltistan Finance Minister Javed Ali Manwa and food department officials also attended the meeting. 
The federal government will also release another Rs5bn for development budget in the next two days, the press release said.  
In the meeting, the federal government was informed by the Gilgit-Baltistan government that without necessary support for the development of the agricultural sector in the region, there are serious challenges to increase subsidised wheat prices.
It demanded the federal government to provide required resources for agriculture development to produce wheat at local level. 
Talking to Dawn, Mr Kaira said that it was a mutual decision of the Gilgit-Baltistan government and the federal government to increase subsidised wheat prices to maintain supply of the commodity to the region. 
He said it was difficult to maintain the quantity of subsidised wheat supply to Gilgit-Baltistan in the allocated funds as the wheat prices had increased across the country. 
Mr Kaira said the federal government had not given any condition to the GB government to release funds for subsidised wheat. 
He said the GB cabinet had already decided to increase the subsidised wheat prices in the region and the federal government had agreed to the GB government’s decision. 
Mr Kaira said that despite financial crunch, the federal government would continue to support the GB government.
He said the federal government on Friday released Rs5bn for development in GB.

5,"Chinese, Afghan FMs arrive in Islamabad for trilateral talks","President Alvi meets Beijing diplomat, vows to work together on regional peace.","ISLAMABAD: Top Chinese and Afghan diplomats touched down in Islamabad on Friday to participate in bilateral and trilateral meetings on a range of issues, including security and the economy.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari confirmed in a tweet that he would meet his Afghan and Chinese counterparts on Saturday (today).
Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, who is on a two-day visit, also called on President Arif Alvi on Friday with a delegation. Both sides reaffirmed the resolve to work together to promote regional peace and prosperity as well as jointly cope with external challenges.
According to a statement issued by the Presidency, both sides stressed the need to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, economy, culture and defence.

President Alvi meets Beijing diplomat, vows to work together on regional peace

They also called for “increasing bilateral exchanges, people-to-people contacts, and cooperation in the fields of culture and tourism to further cement bilateral ties”, it said.
The meeting was also attended by the state minister for foreign affairs, Hina Rabbani Khar, Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs, Sun Weidong, and senior government officials of both countries.
Welcoming Mr Qin, President Alvi said Pakistan-China relations were rooted in mutual trust, understanding, and goodwill and both sides firmly supported each other on core issues.
 






He highlighted that Pakistan-China mutual cooperation was assuming an even greater significance in the light of new developments in the regional and international arenas.
Pakistan was committed to the completion of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Gwadar port, which would play a significant role in promoting bilateral and regional trade and improving connectivity, he said.
Mr Alvi said Pakistan would take effective measures to ensure the security of the Chinese workers at various CPEC projects. He expres­sed optimism that the recent opening of Khunjerab Pass would facilitate the movement of goods from Xinjiang to Gwadar and vice versa.
He also emphasised the need to increase economic and commercial cooperation, particularly in the IT and agriculture sectors, adding that Chinese investors should benefit from Pakistan’s business and investment-friendly policies.
However, he expressed concern over the planned holding of G-20 Summit events by India in occupied Kashmir and described it as an Indian attempt to divert the world’s attention away from the ground realities and its atrocities against the people of Kashmir.
He said that Pakistan supported China on all its core issues, including the “One-China policy”, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea. He also appreciated the support provided by China during last year’s unprecedented floods in Pakistan and the Covid-19 pandemic.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qin said that China and Pakistan were all-weather friends and the friendship between the two countries was “as solid as a rock”. He stated that in view of the fast-changing world, Pakistan and China needed to further fortify and strengthen bilateral cooperation to meet the emerging regional and international challenges. He called for advancing cooperation in all areas of mutual interest, especially on projects of strategic importance.
Mr Qin said China was cognisant of Pakistan’s economic difficulties, saying that it was the priority of his country to help Pakistan. He said that China would welcome Pakistani students to study in Chinese educational institutions.
He also thanked President Alvi for visiting China in March 2020 to show solidarity with the people and government of China during the Covid pandemic.
Meanwhile, Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has also arrived on a four-day visit with a high-level delegation, including the acting minister for commerce and industry, Haji Nooruddin Azizi, and senior officials from the foreign, transport and trade ministries.
Apart from participating in the fifth China-Pakistan-Afghanistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue, he will also participate in some bilateral meetings.
Mr Muttaqi’s visit is a continuation of Pakistan’s political engagement with Afghanistan, which, among other things, included Ms Khar’s visit to Kabul in November and a visit of a high-level delegation led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif in February.

6,Over 8m Pakistanis face hunger after floods: UN,New report states roughly 258m people in 58 countries face food shortage at crisis levels,"UNITED NATIONS: In the last quarter of 2022, 8.6m in rural districts of three provinces of Pakistan faced a serious food crisis as one of the worst monsoon floods in years hit the country, said a UN-backed report released this week.
Of these people, 5.2 million were in nine districts of Sindh, 1.8m in seven districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 1.6m in 12 districts of Balochistan.
The latest global report on food crises, released by UN agencies on Thursday, warned that roughly 258m people in 58 countries faced acute hunger at crisis levels. And people in seven countries — Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Haiti, and Burkina Faso — faced potential starvation.
This is the highest number in the seven-year history of the report, although much of the growth reflects an increase in the population analysed.
In Pakistan, the increase in severity, from 25 per cent to 43pc, “indicates a significantly deteriorating situation in all provinces, especially in Sindh, where five areas that were previously classified as in crisis shifted to emergency,” the report warns.

New report states roughly 258m people in 58 countries face food shortage at crisis levels

Overall, the share of the analysed population in crisis increased from 19pc to 30pc, while the proportion in emergency increased from 6pc to13pc.
Pakistan has been defined as a ‘major’ food crisis since 2017 when over 50pc of its analysed population was in phase three (crisis) or above.
Weather extremes
Even before Pakistan was hit by the devastating monsoon floods in mid-June and the end of August, heatwaves in March and April, in conjunction with fertiliser shortages and lack of irrigation water, had affected ‘Rabi’ wheat crop yields and lowered livestock production in most of the analysed districts.
Subsequently, flooding and landslides brought widespread destruction, disrupting the lives and livelihoods of about 33m people in five of six provinces.
Around 4.4m acres of agricultural land were damaged, prompting the downward revision of 2022 production forecasts for rice, maize, sorghum, and millet. Around 0.8m livestock were estimated to have perished.
The total damage and loss in the agriculture sector was estimated at almost $13bn, consisting mainly of crops (82pc) followed by livestock (17pc).
The October–December planting of the ‘Rabi’ wheat crop was hampered in localised areas that were still under flood water. 
The loss or damage of agricultural inputs, including seed stocks, fertilisers, machinery and irrigation infrastructure, may result in a contraction in the area planted with a negative impact on 2023 production.
Strong domestic demand and high global commodity prices — largely linked to Covid-19-related disruptions and the war in Ukraine — led to the largest current account deficit in four years by the end of June 2022. The currency depreciated by 23.1pc against the US dollar and inflation reached an average of 12.2pc by the end of June, an 11-year high.
By August 2022, prices of wheat flour were about 30pc higher year-on-year and domestic prices of rice were at record levels.
Prices continued to increase until the end of the year and, by December 2022, the price of a basket of basic food items was 36pc higher year-on-year, the report noted.
A damage, loss and needs assessment estimated total flood damages to exceed $14.9bn, and total economic losses to reach about $15.2bn.
Due to higher domestic energy prices, flood disruptions, high agricultural input costs and the weaker rupee, inflation is projected to rise to 23pc in the year to the end of June 2023.
