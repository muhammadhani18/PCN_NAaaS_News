1,KP asks centre to pay Rs62 billion hydel profit dues,"In letter to PM, CM also demands profit rate hike.","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa caretaker government has formally urged the federal government to immediately make the outstanding payment of Rs62 billion net hydel profit to it and increase the rate of profit.
In a letter, Chief Minister Mohammad Azam Khan urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to act on Article 161(2) of the Constitution, which declares that the net profit from the bulk generation of power at a hydro-electric station shall be paid to the province in which the hydro-electric station is situated.
The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, read that the Constitution provides for the payment of NHP to the provinces at the rate determined by the Council of Common Interest.
According to it, the Kazi Committee Methodology (KCM) was approved by the CCI in Jan 1991, while the first payment of Rs6 billion was made to KP (then North Western Frontier Province) next year.

In letter to PM, CM also demands profit rate hike

The KCM was endorsed by the National Finance Commission in 1988 and the Supreme Court in 1997. It was subsequently okayed by the CCI in 1991, 1993, 1997, 1998, 2016, 2018 and 2019, the CM noted in the letter.
Mr Khan said that in 2016, the federal government, realising KP was in dire straits and on the instruction of the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, announced an interim NHP agreement brokered by then finance minister Ishaq Dar.
He added that the agreement provided for the NHP payment of Rs1.10 kwh with a hike in Wapda generation tariff with an effect on consumer tariff of approximately 30 paisa per unit.
“The Wapda started payment to Punjab and KP accordingly. However, the flow of payment was not regular as per interim agreement resulting in a shortfall of Rs62 billion in 2022-23. It may be kept in mind that the average national tariff has increased from Rs10 kwh to Rs34 kwh, showing an increase of 340pc,” he said in the letter.
The CM said that the KP government later took the issue of the implementation of KCM to the CCI and the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, constituted a committee headed by the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission to deliberate upon the issue of the determination of rates and net profit in light of the CCI decisions.
He added that the committee, in its report submitted to the CCI in Dec 2019, declared that the KCM had attained finality in view of the numerous unanimous decisions of the CCI spanning over four decades and it could no longer be reopened.
The committee also asked the federal government to ensure direct payments to the provinces to discharge its constitutional responsibility, he said.
Mr Khan said that the CCI endorsed calculation of Rs128 billion as KP share and Rs52 billion to Punjab as the NHP for the year 2016-17 was based on the KCM, while another committee was formed to propose an out-of-box solution to the NHP payment issue.
“Three important points emerged out of out-of-box solutions committee deliberations, which were completed in 2022 and which included transfer of hydel power stations to the provinces, construction of hydel generation powers from the federal public services development programme and announcement of 2nd interim agreement with an enhanced rate of the NHP,” he said.
The CM asked the prime minister to place the out-of-box committee report before the CCI for consideration.
“In the meanwhile, a second interim agreement may be announced with an enhanced NHP of Rs2 per kwh and 10pc increase in Wapda generation tariff with an effect of Rs1 per kwh on consumer and tariff,” he said.
Mr Khan asked the prime minister in the letter to ensure an immediate payment of Rs62 billion NHP arrears to the province directly by the Central Power Purchasing Agency.

2,Owners threaten to shut flour mills,"PESHAWAR: Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter on Friday warned the government that ...","PESHAWAR: Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter on Friday warned the government that it would shut all the flour mills in the province by Monday or Tuesday if wheat supply from Punjab is not restored immediately.
Speaking at a news conference at the Peshawar Press Club, PFMA provincial chairman Haji Mohammad Iqbal demanded of the federal and provincial governments of KP and Punjab to intervene in the matter and ensure smooth inter-provincial supply of wheat. “If wheat transportation is not restored immediately then the KP people will face serious flour crisis,” he said. Owing to the ban, flour prices are increasing with each passing day, he added.
The millers, their workers and flour dealers also staged a demonstration outside the press club. The protesters also marched on different roads and chanted slogans against the Punjab government and its bureaucracy for imposing ban on wheat transportation.
Mr Iqbal said if ban on wheat transportation from Punjab was not lifted, the association would launch a country-wide protest.
Commenting on the allegation of flour smuggling to Afghanistan, he said how the commodity could be smuggled to the neighbouring country if the government had deployed personnel of 17 departments and agencies on the border. 
He claimed Punjab’s ban on wheat transportation was unconstitutional and illegal. “Article 151 of the Constitution doesn’t allow any restriction on the inter-provincial transportation of wheat or any other edible commodity,” he said. He said the Punjab government’s move was creating “hatred” among the federating units.
“Ban on supply of wheat was meant to close flour mills in KP and deprive thousands of workers of their jobs,” he said.
The PFMA provincial chairman said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should announce a special package to save KP’s flour mills, which employed thousands of people, from destruction.
He said Punjab produced around 80 per cent of the country’s wheat and KP depended on it to meet its wheat and flour needs. He said KP required five million tonnes of wheat annually but its production totalled only 0.8 million tonnes.
Mr Iqbal said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had around 260 flour mills, but almost 70 per cent of them had stopped operations due to ban on wheat supply to the province. He demanded of the prime minister, the Punjab’s chief minister and other relevant quarters to step in for the immediate abolition of checkposts and end to the ban on inter-provincial wheat transportation.
He also said flour mills of KP should be allowed to purchase wheat from private groups in Punjab.

4,"Parliament, judiciary ‘silent’ on killings, regret Swat leaders",Large rally staged against KP terror wave; Senator Mushtaq says CJP busy taking up political cases but ignores terror wave in Pakhtun belt.,"SWAT: Pakhtun leaders on Friday complained that dozens of their community members were killed in the last two months but both parliament and judiciary were silent about those killings.
They showed up in a large rally staged by the Swat Olasi Pasoon (Swat Public Uprising) at the Kanju Chowk of Kabal tehsil here.
People from across the province attended the protest and condemned the recent wave of terrorism in the province, including blasts at the counter-terrorism department building in Kabal area, the Lakki Marwat police station attack, and the killing of eight teachers in a Kurram school.
Noted among the speakers were PTM chief Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen, Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, MNA Ali Wazir, Mir Kalam Wazir, Saeed Khan, Sher Shah Khan, Ayoub Asharey, Talemand Khan, Muzzamil Shah, Aftab Khan, Izhar Ahmad, Ajab Khan Toyaley, Abdul Rahim, Dr Amjad and Usman Fanoos Gujjar.

Large rally staged in Swat against terror wave in province

They said recently, dozens of people were killed by terrorists in separate attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but unfortunately, no one from parliament and mainstream media raised voice for them.
“Pakistani TV channels show cricket matches and the body of an elephant but unfortunately, they don’t cover the Pakhtuns killed in terrorist attacks suggesting that the media along with parliament and judiciary is not for Pakhtuns,” Senator Mushtaq claimed.
He said the Supreme Court’s chief justice was busy taking up political cases but ignored the terror wave in Pakhtun belt.
“More than 22 military operations were conducted in Pakhtun areas but they all were meant to collect American dollars and not to restore peace,” he said.
The lawmaker said from January 1 to April 30, at least 120 policemen were killed in KP.
He said India was eliminating its cantonments declaring them the “symbols” of British rule, but the Pakistan Army was increasing the number of such areas in the country.
MNA Ali Wazir said the wrong policies of the state turned the beautiful and peaceful Swat region into the “hell of gunpowder”.
He said Pakhtunshad no option but to get united against the state’s terror policies.
PTM chief Manzoor Pashteen wondered who created terrorists and spread modern weapons in the country.
He said external forces didn’t cause terrorism in the country.
“It is strange that more than 20 military operations were carried out but they failed to eliminate a handful of terrorists,” he said.
Mr Pashteen said Pakhtuns were aware of the reality of terrorism and won’t be deceived “this time around.”
Without naming names, he said the people entered Pakhtun areas on their own and with certain designs but were “expelled with the choice of Pakhtuns.”
The PTM leader said such people didn’t go back with humiliation.
He said that every military operation was carried out under strange slogans and names just to accumulate American dollars.
The speakers said there won’t be any compromise on peace and that Pakhtuns would allow their killings in the “war fought for dollars.”
They rejected the claim of the KP police that a short circuit caused the Kabal CTD blasts and demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident.
The speakers said that if another terrorist incident occurred on Pakhtun soil in the country, the next protest would be staged outside cantonment areas instead of open spaces or bazaars.

9,"PHC seeks list of plazas without parking, other facilities",Authorities claim action taken over violation of building code,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Friday directed a petitioner to produce a list of commercial and residential plazas without basic facilities, including parking area, separate bathrooms for men and women, and ramp for persons with disabilities.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed M Attique Shah and Justice Wiqar Ahmad issued the directions during the hearing into a petition by Peshawar resident Mohammad Furqan Qazi, who challenged the unavailability of facilities in commercial and residential plazas of the provincial capital and other major cities of the province.
The bench issued the directives after the counsel for the petitioner, Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel, challenged the replies filed by some respondents, including the Peshawar Development Authority, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Agency and local government department, to the petition.
The respondents claimed that all plazas in the provincial capital had been constructed in accordance with the required building code and that they had all the requisite facilities, including parking area.

Authorities claim action taken over violation of building code

The counsel said that his client would conduct a survey and provide a list of such commercial and residential plazas which lacked basic facilities.
He requested the bench that action may be taken against those respondents who had submitted wrong information to the court.
The lawyer argued that building designs of plazas had been approved by the relevant quarter without looking into the deficiencies in these buildings.
He said the provincial capital had several plazas without ramps for persons with disabilities, while many plazas lacked bathrooms or separate bathrooms for men and women.
The counsel added that it was evident that several plazas lacked proper parking forcing visitors to park vehicles on the roadside causing traffic congestion.
He contended that while the personnel of traffic police had been trying to ensure smooth flow of traffic on the city’s roads, the unavailability of parking facilities increased traffic problems.
The bench observed that the respondents claimed in the comments on the petition that building designs were only approved only if they were found to be in accordance with the building code and included required facilities for visitors.
The counsel disputed the replies of the respondents and said that even in some of the under-construction plazas the said facilities were not included.
Lawyers for the respondents contended that the relevant departments had been taking action against any such building, which violated the building code.
They claimed that construction of plazas not meeting the requirements wasn’t allowed.

10,Call to reopen Bisham rehabilitation centre,SHANGLA: The differently-abled persons from Shangla and Kohistan have demanded of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal...,"SHANGLA: The differently-abled persons from Shangla and Kohistan have demanded of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal governments to reopen the centre for rehabilitation of physically-challenged people in Bisham and also include it in the Sehat Sahulat Card programme. 
Talking to Dawn here on Friday, they said the centre was run by a non-government organisation, Chal Foundation, but it had closed the facility due to financial constraints.
The data obtained from the centre shows it had total 2,091 differently-abled persons, including children, registered with it, who regularly visited it to get treatment.
The data shows the centre had performed a total of 43,950 procedures during last 12 years since the NGO took its control from Pakistan Institute of Prosthetic and Orthotic Sciences (PIPOS), which ran it since its establishment after the 2005 earthquake.
Habibullah, a physically-challenged person, said he had his leg broken in an accident in Ranyal area, and after initial treatment, he had come to the Bisham rehabilitation centre, where he was fitted with an artificial leg, which was changed from time to time.
He said closure of the centre had concerned him because there was no such facility nearby, where he could get his artificial leg replaced from time to time.
Faryal Bibi, who also got an artificial leg, said the rehabilitation centre was like a home for her as it had enabled her to walk and do some work.
She said her parents could not afford buying expensive prosthesis for her, and appealed to the NGO and the government authorities to reopen the centre. She suggested registering the centre with the Sehat Sahulat Card programme to help the NGO manage the expenses.
The differently-abled persons threatened to come onto the roads if the centre was not reopened. 
A representative of the Chall Foundation told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the centre was closed after Eidul Fitr over paucity funds. He, however, said the NGO was making efforts to run it through help from philanthropists.
