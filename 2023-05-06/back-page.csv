0,Pakistan against ‘arbitrary’ changes to Security Council,Suggests reforms for existing imbalances in regional representation.,"UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has again urged the international community to seek widest possible consensus for reforming the UN Security Council (UNSC), instead of endorsing arbitrary changes.
Addressing a meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiations framework (IGN) in New York, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram said that the IGN process “offers the best avenue” to reach an agreement on the “equitable representation and reform of the Security Council.”
IGN is a group of nation-states working within the United Nations to reform the Council and comprises several international organisations like the African Union, the Arab League, and the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group. Pakistan is a leading member of the UfC group of nations.
The IGN held the fifth and final meeting of the intergovernmental negotiations on the reforms, which completed the scheduled IGN meetings for the 77th session of the General Assembly.

Suggests reforms for existing imbalances in regional representation

“We agree that your initiatives and the informal-informal exchanges, the interaction with academia have all breathed ‘new life’ in the Security Council reform process,” the Pakistani ambassador said.
“Pakistan believes it is only through patient exchanges, mutual accommodation, and compromise that we can broaden the areas of convergence and reduce the points of divergence,” said Ambassador Akram while explaining Pakistan’s position on the reforms.
Only through this process “(we can) evolve a model for the reform that can be accepted by the widest possible majority of member states” of the United Nations, he added.
Pakistan noted that the revised elements paper of the IGN’s co-chairs, reflected their understanding of the convergences and divergences among member states on the issue of UNSC reforms. “This is a useful modality to reflect our discussions, without compromising the official positions of various groups and states,” he said while opposing the attempt to transform this paper into ‘a basis for negotiations’.
The paper states that the security council could be made more representative  such as through enlargement, including better representation for Africa, as well as more systematic arrangements for more voices at the table.
Pakistan has endorsed IGN’s statement on Convergences that the reform of the Security Council is a member states-driven process; the principle of democracy remains important; the IGN should seek solutions that garner the widest political acceptance by member states. “While this does not imply unanimity, it certainly does imply the desire for a consensus … we are seeking the widest possible acceptance which in other words means consensus and this is what we aim for,” Ambassador Akram said.
The Pakistani envoy, however, pointed out that the UfC, which includes Pakistan, “continues to oppose any attempt to attribute positions in the elements paper”.
Mr Akram stated that besides the UfC, and the Arab and the African groups, several other individual member states, including some permanent members of the UNSC, had called for a prior agreement on principles of the reform before proceeding to text-based negotiations.
The IGN paper acknowledged that the expansion of the category of two-year term non-permanent members is accepted by all member states.
While noting this, Ambassador Akram said there’s no convergence on the creation of new permanent members. There’s, however, a possible convergence, on the potential compromise between the proposals for permanent members and for two-year non-permanent seats, which is the option of longer-term or re-electable non-permanent seats as offered by the UfC.
“The reform of the Security Council should redress the existing imbalances in regional representation — adding to the representation of the under-represented regions and reducing, or at least not adding to the representation of the over-represented regions,” said the envoy.

1,SCO FMs’ moot paves way for July summit,"Bilawal, Jaishankar talk about Shehbaz’s participation in Delhi meeting.","NEW DELHI: The Shanghai Cooperation Orga­nisation (SCO) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting concluded in Goa on Friday, paving the way for a summit of the group’s leaders in New Delhi on July 3-4.
Despite thinly veiled unflattering references to each other, Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers appeared to have ensured that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would participate in the meeting.
This leaves enough time for hard speculation all round and possible ground work too to ponder an agreeable bilateral outcome. Much of course would depend on the twists and turns of domestic politics within Pakistan, analysts say.
From the Chinese perspective, the Goa meeting’s objective was to “further enhance mutual trust and dispel concerns among member states ahead of the upcoming SCO summit in July.”
Sources said that wasn’t difficult with the use of some degree of diplomatic finesse. The Delhi agenda passed at Goa includes the pending inclusion of Belarus and Iran to the SCO club.

Bilawal, Jaishankar talk about Shehbaz’s participation in Delhi meeting; China says ties with Russia, India will only grow stronger

“It is an honour for me to represent Pakistan today at the SCO-CFM,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari told the foreign ministers’ meeting.
“Pakistan considers the SCO a key regional platform comprising countries, which are bound together by longstanding historical, cultural, civilisational and geographical ties. There couldn’t be a more powerful indication of the importance that Pakistan attaches to the SCO than my presence here in Goa for this CFM.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s faith in the ‘Shanghai Spirit’, saying it “strongly believes in and fully adheres to the principles of mutual trust, equality, respect for cultural diversity, and the pursuit of shared development” enshrined in the promise.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang assured his Russian and Indian counterparts of deepening bilateral ties, promising that “coordination and cooperation” will only grow stronger, in a show of solidarity with two of China’s biggest neighbours, adds Reuters.
During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the SCO meeting, Qin said China is “willing to maintain communication and coordination with Russia to make tangible contributions to the political settlement of the crisis” in Ukraine.
The two sides also agreed to strengthen communication and coordination with other SCO member-states and maintain the bloc’s “unity”, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry on Friday.
They additionally agreed to strengthen coordination in the Asia-Pacific, the ministry said, without giving details.
In their speeches at the meeting, the foreign ministers of India, Russia and Pakistan called for a representative government in Afghanistan and the protection of women’s rights.
“The unfolding situation in Afghanistan remains at the centre of our attention. Our efforts should be directed towards the welfare of the Afghan people,” Mr Jaishankar said.
Mr Lavrov said Moscow expected the Taliban leadership to “deliver on their promises to come up with an inclusive government”.

2,Five Indian soldiers killed in held Kashmir,"SRINAGAR: Five Indian soldiers were killed in held Kashmir on Friday, with the army blaming the deaths on an...","SRINAGAR: Five Indian soldiers were killed in held Kashmir on Friday, with the army blaming the deaths on an explosive device triggered by fighters in the disputed territory.
The Indian army has been conducting search operations in Rajouri district near the Line of Control since last month to hunt fighters it blamed for an attack on an army truck that killed five troops.
In a statement, the Indian army claimed a search team “established contact with a group of terrorists well entrenched in a cave” in an area “thickly vegetated with rocky and steep cliffs”.
The suspects then triggered an explosive device that killed two soldiers and injured four others, three of whom later succumbed to their injuries, it said.
AFP could not independently verify the incident.
Anger against Indian rule in occupied Kashmir has grown since 2019 when New Delhi cancelled the region’s partial autonomy.
Since 1989, Kashmiri groups have fought about 500,000 Indian soldiers deployed in the India-held territory, demanding independence or a merger with Pakistan.
Tens of thousands of Kashmiri people and Indian soldiers have been killed so far.

3,Covid no longer threat to global health: WHO,"Covid deaths have dropped by 95pc since the start of the year, says UN agency.","PARIS: The World Health Organisation may no longer consider Covid-19, a global health emergency, but the virus is not going anywhere.
While the UN agency’s lifting of its highest alert level on Friday marks a turning point in the pandemic, the virus is still circulating around the world and could still surprise us, experts warn.
Here is the current state of play for Covid, which WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said has now killed at least 20 million people.
After the massive waves of infections that hit countries in the pandemic early stages, the number of deaths from Covid has dramatically fallen, largely due to increased immunity from vaccination or previous infection.
Covid deaths have dropped by 95 per cent since the start of the year, according to the WHO.
Experts now expect a lower normal level of Covid to be punctuated with seasonal resurgences, similar to influenza.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier warned against ‘pandemic fatigue’. “This virus is here to stay, and all countries will need to learn to manage it alongside other infectious diseases,” he said.
Seven million deaths 
More than 765 million Covid infections and nearly seven million deaths have been officially reported to the WHO since the start of the pandemic. However, Tedros said at least 20 million people were estimated to have been killed by Covid — nearly three times the official number.

4,Eight dead in second Serbia mass shooting; suspect arrested,President proposes tough new gun controls,"DUBONA: Police arrested a suspect on Friday after eight people were killed and 14 wounded in Serbia’s second mass shooting in just two days, in what President Aleksandar Vucic ca­ll­ed a terrorist attack as he proposed tough new gun controls.
The Balkan country was already reeling from a mass shooting on Wednesday, when authorities say a 13-year-old boy shot dead nine and wounded seven at a school in Belgrade before turning himself in.
Serbs had just begun three days of mourning on Friday for those victims as news broke of the second shooting, which authorities said began late on Thursday in the village of Dubona, 42 km south of Belgrade.
“This is terrible for our country, this is a huge defeat. In two days so many ... killed,” said village resident Ivan.
State broadcaster RTS said the suspect, a young man, had been involved in an altercation in a school yard. He left and then returned with an assault rifle and a handgun, opened fire and continued to shoot at people at random from a moving car.

President proposes tough new gun controls

The suspect also fired at people in two other nearby villages before fleeing, authorities said. Police found him eventually hiding in his grandfather’s house, where they also discovered hand grenades, an automatic rifle and ammunition.
“The suspect UB, born in 2002, has been apprehended in the vicinity of the city of Kragujevac, he is suspected of killing eight people and wounding 14 overnight,” Serbia’s interior ministry said in a statement. An investigation was ongoing.
Police also arrested the suspect’s grandfather and uncle.
Serbian Health Minister Danica Grujicic said many of the wounded had suffered multiple injuries and had undergone surgery, but she added that all were in a stable condition.
President Vucic, in a sombre national address, said the gunman had been wearing a T-shirt with neo-Nazi symbols. He proposed a moratorium on gun permits regardless of weapon type, in what he called a “practical disarmament” of Serbia that would also include more frequent medical and psychological checks of gun owners.
The government would also hire 1,200 new police officers to improve security in schools, said Vucic.
‘Monsters’ 
“There will be justice. These monsters will never see the light of the day, neither the little monster nor the little older monster,” he said, referring respectively to the suspected gunmen from Wednesday and Thursday.
Vucic said he had proposed the reintroduction of the death penalty but said the government was against such a step. In Serbia, the president is largely a ceremonial figure but Vucic wields considerable power as he also heads the ruling party.
RTS said an off-duty policeman and his sister were among those killed in the latest shooting.
“This is sad, the young policeman is my daughter’s age, born in 1998,” said Danijela, a middle-aged woman in Dubona. “My daughter is taking sedatives, we could not sleep all night. They grew up together.” The gunman also shot at people in the nearby village of Malo Orasije, according to Zarko Knezevic, a 78-year-old farmer, who said he had heard gunshots there and people running away.
“I don’t know how many of them were running away, there were a lot of young people,” he said.
Serbia has an entrenched gun culture, especially in rural areas, but also strict gun control laws. Automatic weapons are illegal and over the years authorities have offered several amnesties to those who surrender them.
Still, Serbia and the rest of the Western Balkans remain awash with military-grade weapons and ordnance that remained in private hands after the wars of the 1990s.

5,Wagner chief threatens pullout from Bakhmut,Paramilitary forces to hand over positions to units of Russian defence ministry on 10th,"MOSCOW: Russian paramilitary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a sudden and dramatic announcement on Friday that his forces would leave the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that they have been trying to capture since last summer.
In an extraordinary attack on military chiefs that exposed a deep rift in Russian ranks ahead of an expected Ukrainian offensive, Prigozhin in a series of scathing videos blamed Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov for “tens of thousands” of killed and wounded Russian fighters in Ukraine.
He vowed to hold them to account over what he said was a failure to provide fighters from his mercenary group, Wagner, with sufficient ammunition.
“For the tens of thousands killed and wounded, they will bear responsibility in front of their mothers and children, I will achieve that,” he said.

Paramilitary forces to hand over positions to units of Russian defence ministry on 10th

“Their unprofessionalism is des­troying tens of thousands of Russian guys and that is unforgivable.” 
Wagner has spearheaded the grinding, months-long Russian assault on Bakhmut, almost capturing the city in the longest and bloodiest battle of the campaign.
While Prigozhin has made similar threats to pull out in the past, the emotive language and the scathing personal criticism of the leaders of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine were unprecedented.
“On May 10, 2023 we will have to hand over our positions in Bakhmut to units of the defence ministry and withdraw Wagner units to rear camps to lick our wounds,” Prigozhin said in a written statement on Telegram.
“I will pull out Wagner units from Bakhmut because, in the absence of ammunition, they are facing a senseless death,” he said, adding that he was now expecting a plan from the military on how to implement the withdrawal.
Ukraine said that Russia was still “doing their best to take control of Bakhmut” in time for World War II Victory Day celebrations on May 9 — Moscow’s most important holiday and a central event under President Vladimir Putin’s rule.
Ukraine is preparing a major offensive against Russian forces and experts say a series of sabotage attacks and long-distance strikes behind Russian lines are in preparation for that. 
Oil refinery fire 
In the latest development, a fire broke out at an oil refinery in southern Russia on Friday — a day after authorities confirmed a drone attack at the same facility.
Russia on Friday also announced the evacuation of some 70,000 people from areas near the front line in southern Ukraine, blaming an intensification of Ukrainian shelling on residential areas.
Earlier, Prigozhin posted a video on Telegram showing rows of what he said were dead Wagner fighters in which he blamed Shoigu and Gerasimov for their deaths. “We have an ammunition shortage of 70 per cent,” he said in his tirade, in which several expletives were bleeped out. “You sit in your (blee­ped) expensive clubs... You think you are the masters of life and you have the right to decide on their lives,” he said, pointing at the bodies.
Partial evacuation 
Russia on Friday ordered the evacuation of families with children and of the elderly from Russian-held frontline areas in southern Ukraine because of an increase in shelling from the Ukrainian side.
“In the past few days, the enemy has stepped up shelling of settlements close to the front line,” the Russian-installed head of the Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, wrote on social media.
“I have therefore made a decision to evacuate first of all children and parents, elderly people, disabled people and hospital patients,” he wrote.
