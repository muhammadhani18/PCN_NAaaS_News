“It’s clear that without the knowledge of their minders, the terrorists from Kyiv could not have carried out (the attack),” Lavrov said during a visit to India, referring to Washington.
On Wednesday Russia said it had thwarted a drone attack on the Kremlin, in what it said was a Ukrainian assassination attempt on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“We will respond with concrete actions,” Lavrov said on Friday.
Ukraine has denied responsibility, with Ukrai­nian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying “we do not attack Moscow or Putin”. 
The United States also rejected any accusation of involvement, and accused the Kremlin of “lying” about its role in the drone attack. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow on Thursday “not to use this alleged attack as an excuse to continue escalation of the war”. 
US experts’ view
The drones that crashed over the Kremlin earlier this week probably evaded an extensive number of defen­ces in and around Moscow, suggesting they might have been launched from inside Russia, US-b­as­ed drones experts said.
Footage of the unmanned aircraft has sent governments and open source intelligence analysts on a hunt to discover the origin of the drones designed to fly to a destination and explode.
Moscow has been very concerned about protecting the Kremlin from drones since at least 2015 when it began using electronic countermeasures to automatically direct them away by “spoofing” GPS locations, said Dana Goward, president of the non-profit Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, which advocates tougher and redundant GPS.

1,"Rohingya team visits Myanmar, rules out refugee return from BD",Bangladesh refugee commissioner nonetheless says that his country wanted the repatriation scheme to go ahead.,"TEKNAF (Bangladesh): Rohingya refugees who visited Myanmar on Friday said they would not voluntarily agree to return there, after touring facilities meant to accommodate the repatriation of the stateless minority to their homeland.
 
 

Bangladesh is home to about a million Rohingya, most of whom fled a 2017 military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar that is now subject to a UN genocide investigation.
Both countries signed a repatriation agreement to return them later that year, but little progress has been made since, and the United Nations has repeatedly warned conditions were not right for their return.
Several Bangladeshi officials accompanied 20 Rohingya refugees during Friday’s visit to two model village resettlement camps erected for the pilot return project.
“We have seen the camps… But they don’t accept our citizenship demands,” Mohammad Salim, a Rohingya member of the delegation, said.
“We will not go to the camps,” he added. “We must return to our own land.
‘‘We didn’t like it there. We won’t go. We will return if our safe repatriation and demands are accepted.“
A woman member of the delegation said she was worried about her safety in the newly built facilities, which include a market, hospital and reception centre for returning refugees.
“Nothing is safe for us there. They can subjugate and torture us again,” she said on condition of anonymity.
Bangladesh refugee commissioner Miza­nur Rahman, who accompanied the delegation, nonetheless said that his country wanted the repatriation scheme to go ahead.

2,Sunak’s Tories suffer drubbing at local polls,"LONDON: Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives faced steep losses in local election results on Friday, undermining the ...","LONDON: Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives faced steep losses in local election results on Friday, undermining the British prime minister’s efforts to revive their fortunes and emboldening the opposition Labour Party ahead of a national vote expected next year.
Sunak came to power in October following a year of political scandals, surging inflation and stagnant economic growth. In office he has faced a cost-of-living crisis, mounting concern about healthcare and widespread industrial action.
While governing parties often struggle at mid-term elections, the council results in England are the largest, and possibly last, test of voter sentiment before the next national election due by January 2025.
After a majority of councils had counted their votes, which do not affect the government’s majority in parliament, the Conservatives had a net loss of 460 seats while Labour added 260 seats and the Liberal Democrats gained 143.
Labour said they were now on track for power at the next general election. A Sky News projection based on the vote share of the early results said Labour could garner 36-38 per cent of the vote at the next national election, making them the biggest party, with the Conservatives at 28-30pc.
The projection said Labour might fall short of a majority, though that could depend on how it fares in Scotland, where it is competing to take seats from the Scottish National Party and which did not hold local polls.
A similar BBC projection said Labour would get 35pc at a national election and the Conservatives 26pc, and some in Sunak’s party voiced their disquiet over the results.
Labour won control of Swindon borough council, a town in southwest England where Labour leader Keir Starmer launched his election campaign, and which has always voted for lawmakers for the governing party since 1983.
“No spin, no gloss. This is a dreadful set of results,” said Justin Tomlinson, Conservative lawmaker in parliament for Swindon North. “The party collectively needs to take this as a wake-up call to refresh and renew.” 
The votes were to elect around 8,000 councillors to local government authorities which have responsibility for the day-to-day provision of services such as bin collections and schools.
Sunak’s party suffered losses to Labour in key target seats in the north and southern England, while the Liberal Democrats advanced in wealthier parts of the south.
Sunak told reporters the results so far showed that people wanted his ruling party to deliver on their priorities, but that it was still too early in the process of announcing results to draw firm conclusions as counts continue.
Sunak admitted results looked “disappointing” but claimed he was “not detecting any massive groundswell of movement” towards the main Labour opposition or “excitement for its agenda”.
John Curtice, Britain’s best-known pollster, said the results were an “unambiguous” rebuff to the Conservatives but there was still an open question over how popular Labour were.
“(Labour) might achieve winning an overall majority, not because of any great enthusiasm of the electorate for Labour, but rather simply because the Conserva­tives are doing so badly,” he told BBC radio.
Sunak has tried to restore the Conservatives’ credibility since he took over as prime minister and as his party’s third leader in the past year following the scandal-ridden premiership of Boris Johnson and the chaotic economic policies that brought down Liz Truss within two months.

3,British court jails Nigerian senator for kidney-harvesting plot,"LONDON: A wealthy Nigerian politician, his wife and a doctor were jailed by a London court on Friday for trafficking...","LONDON: A wealthy Nigerian politician, his wife and a doctor were jailed by a London court on Friday for trafficking a street trader from Lagos to Britain to illegally harvest his kidney for a transplant for their seriously ill daughter.
Britain’s Crown Prosecu­tion Service (CPS) said Ike Ekweremadu had been sentenced to nine years and eight months in Britain’s first illegal organ-harvesting prosecution, while his wife Beatrice, 56, was sentenced to four years and six months. Nigerian doctor Obinna Obeta, described by prosecutors as a middle man, was jailed for 10 years, the CPS said. All three were convicted in March of conspiring to arrange the travel of a man in order to harvest his organs.
President of the Nige­rian senate Ahmad Lawan said earlier in the week he had written to the British judicial authorities seeking clemency for Ekwere­madu — an opposition senator and former deputy president of Nigeria’s senate — on behalf of the senate. He said “it was the first time our colleague is getting involved in this kind of thing”.
Prosecutors said the couple had brought the man to Britain in February last year with the offer of a few thousand pounds for his organ and the promise of work in Britain.

“Murderers”, “Crimi­nals”, “You’ll pay for this” and “We’re watching you” are just some of the anonymous messages sent to AEMET in recent weeks on social media, by email and even by phone.
The threats were responding to forecasts and reports published by the agency, notably over last week’s early heatwave, when Spain registered its hottest-ever temperature for April, reaching 38.8 degrees Celsius in Cordoba.
“Enough is enough,” wrote Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera on social media.
“Lying, fuelling conspiracies and fear, being insulting... impoverishes us as a society and has unacceptable consequences,” she said.

5,What changes has Britain seen under King Charles?,"Anthem's words change from ""God save the Queen"" to ""God save the King""; Australia decides not to have Charles' image on its new $5 note.","LONDON: From a new face on the country’s stamps and coins to a change of words for the national anthem, Britain has seen a number of alterations since the death of Queen Elizabeth in September and the accession of her son Charles to the throne.
Ahead of his coronation on Satur­day (today), here are some aspects of British daily life that are different since Charles became king.
 






National Anthem
The words of the British national anthem, which in its present form dates back to the 18th century, have changed from “God Save the Queen” to “God Save the King”. The queen had been on the throne for 70 years, and almost eight months after her death, sports teams are getting used to the change.
According to the royal family’s website, the anthem came to prominence amid the patriotic fervour that followed the 1745 victory over Prince Charles Edward Stuart by King George II’s army in Scotland, and was sung in London theatres.
Since September, the first verse has been: “God save our gracious King! Long live our noble King! God save the King! Send him victorious, Happy and glorious, Long to reign over us, God save the King.”
Coins and stamps
The monarch’s image is shown on the British currency. Newly minted 50 pence coins featuring the portrait of King Charles III entered circulation in December, but his image won’t appear on new banknotes until mid-2024, the Bank of England has said.
Coins and banknotes featuring Queen Elizabeth are still in circulation and will be gradually replaced over time.
Since the monarchy was restored in 1660 after the 10-year republic of Oliver Cromwell, it has become traditional for the monarch to face in the opposite direction to their predecessor.
As Queen Elizabeth faced right, Charles is pictured facing left. Postage stamps are likewise being updated to feature the king’s portrait, although those with the queen are still in use.
In Australia, the country has decided not to have the image of King Charles on its new $5 note.
Royal cypher
The Royal Cypher is the monogram used by the monarch. It appears on red mail pillar boxes, government buildings, state documents and police and military uniforms.
Charles’ cypher features his initial, title, Rex Latin for King, and III, alongside a representation of the crown.
In accordance with tradition, both the cypher and the royal coat of arms changed when he became king, but are appearing only gradually.
Replacing cyphers is at the discretion of individual organisations, according to the royal family’s website, and the military, for instance, will continue to wear uniforms with the late queen’s cypher until stocks run out.
Cyphers on pillar boxes will only appear on new boxes and so the queen’s cypher will stay on thousands across the country, just as many remain from previous monarchs on those that were installed before her reign.
Royal Mail said there were no CRIII pillar boxes installed yet and it was using up its supply of those marked EIIR first.
Senior lawyers are now known as King’s Counsel (KC) rather than Queen’s Counsel (QC).

SMOKE rises from Guatemala’s Fuego volcano during an eruption on Thursday.—Reuters

 
GUATEMALA: Guate­malan authorities evacuated more than 1,000 people and closed a road as Central America’s most active volcano erupted on Thursday, spewing thick clouds of ash over farms and towns not far from the capital city.
Civil protection official Oscar Cossio said 1,054 people had been evacuated from five communities near the foot of the volcano, and moved to a sports hall for shelter.
He said that number was likely to rise as a full accounting of the evacuees was carried out.
Guatemala’s Conred disaster centre said the volcano named Fuego, Spanish for “fire,” was sending out “pyroclastic flows” — a high-temperature mix of gas, ash and rock fragments “which descend with great speed down the flanks of the volcanic complex.” The ash column ejected by Fuego reached more than some 19,000 feet above sea level.
Conred said ash was falling to the west and southwest of the volcano, in a direction away from the capital Guatemala City, which is 35 kilometres to the northeast.
Stronger emissions could follow as the “high level” eruption continues, and it warned that with rainfall forecast, mudslides could form.
Conred official Rodolfo Garcia estimated that 130,000 people live within areas exposed to falling ash, which came down as far as 100 kilometres from the crater. He said 13 emergency shelters had opened in four nearby towns, capable of providing refuge to 7,600 people.
The authorities opted to close the RN-14 route on the slopes of the volcano that connects several towns to the colonial city of Antigua, the country’s main tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage site.
It advised those living in areas at risk of the ash cloud to carefully follow any instruction from the authorities, and urged locals and tourists to avoid a restricted area of seven kilometres around the volcano.

7,Covid-era Italian PM attacked by anti-vaxxer,"PM Meloni expresses her “solidarity” with Conte, who had imposed stringent coronavirus restrictions in the early phase of the pandemic.","ROME: An anti-vax campaigner on Friday assaulted Italy’s former premier Giuseppe Conte, who imposed strict restrictions at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, his political party said.
The Five Star Movement, the opposition party led by Conte, wrote on Facebook that Conte had been “attacked by an anti-vaxxer in Massa”, a small Tuscan city where he was attending an election rally.
News agency Ansa said the man struck Conte in the face, blaming him for the lockdown policies imposed during the pandemic and other measures. Police officers later took him away.
As well as his own party, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her “solidarity” with Conte.
“Any form of violence must be condemned without hesitation,” Meloni said in a statement.
“Dissent must be civil and respectful of people and political groups.” Prime minister from June 2018 to February 2021, Conte was the head of government when the Covid-19 outbreak suddenly struck northern Italy in February 2020.
Italy was the first country outside China to suffer a major outbreak of Covid-19.
The virus has killed nearly 190,000 people in Italy to date, according to the health ministry.
Conte imposed stringent coronavirus restrictions in the early phase of the pandemic, including an economically crippling shutdown and the mandating of face masks in public.
His successor as prime minister, Mario Draghi, imposed a compulsory coronavirus health pass in September 2021 tied to the Covid-19 vaccine.
Conte’s early decisions during the breakout, including one not to impose “red zones” in two hard-hit areas, are the subject of an ongoing judicial inquiry.
Investigating magistrates suspect that Conte and his government underestimated the contagiousness of Covid-19 even though available data showed that cases were spreading rapidly.

8,"20,000 moved to guarded camps  in Manipur","GUWAHATI: Authorities in India’s north-eastern state of Manipur have evacuated some 20,000 people to camps under...","GUWAHATI: Authorities in India’s north-eastern state of Manipur have evacuated some 20,000 people to camps under army protection to prevent escalation of ethnic violence just days after clashes between tribal and non-tribal groups.
There have been incidents of looting and arson in parts of the remote state, which borders Myanmar, in recent days and at least 20 people, including two local lawmakers were injured in clashes during a protest on Tuesday. Internet services have been suspended in the state to prevent social media from being used to stir up unrest.
“The situation is not fully under control but it is gradually improving,” P. Doungel, the state’s top police official told reporters in Imphal, the state capital.
“More soldiers were being deployed to strengthen security and about 20,000 people were evacuated from violence-hit areas,” he said adding that three makeshift camps had been set up to lodge and protect people.
Tensions have been rising between the Meitei community, who live in mostly in the main valley, and numerous tribes in the hilly state.
The Meitei people have been agitating to be granted scheduled tribe status. But the recognised tribes in Manipur oppose that status being extended to the Meitei, who are the largest single ethnic group in the state.
Last month, the Manipur High Court asked the government to consider the Meitei community’s plea and decide on it.
India reserves some government jobs, college admissions and elected seats — from village councils to the parliament — for communities under the scheduled tribe category as form of affirmative action to tackle historical structural inequality and discrimination.

9,Callous generals heap misery on Sudanese,More than one million polio vaccines destroyed,"PORT SUDAN: Heavy gunfire echoed around Khartoum on Friday as civilians trapped in the Sudanese capital said the army and rival paramilitary were fighting without regard to their plight.
Battles since mid-April have killed hundreds and wounded thousands, disrupted aid supplies, sent 100,000 refugees fleeing abroad and turned residential areas of Khartoum into war zones.
“It’s been four days without electricity and our situation is difficult,” said 48-year-old Othman Hassan from the southern outskirts of the city. “We are the victims of a war that we aren’t a part of. No one cares about the citizen.” Smoke rose into the air in an area outside Khartoum’s presidential palace and across the River Nile in the adjoining city of Bahri, live footage on broadcaster Al Jazeera showed.
Despite multiple ceasefire declarations, the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) appeared to be fighting for territory ahead of proposed talks.

More than one million polio vaccines destroyed

So far, army leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, a career military officer, and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a former militia leader known as Hemedti who comes from the strife-torn western region of Darfur, have shown little public willingness to negotiate.
Their power struggle risks dragging in outside powers, further destabilising an already restive region.
Across swathes of Khartoum, factories, banks and shops have been looted or damaged, power and water supplies have been failing and residents have reported steep price rises and shortages of basic goods.
Whole neighbourhoods have emptied out, leading people to fear for the houses they left behind. Aya Eltahir said she fled with her family to the northern outskirts of the capital after bullets hit their roof.
“I make plans to return every day, even just to grab more essential items, but the situation is too unsafe,” she said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said at least 551 civilians had died and 4,926 been wounded, based on data from Sudan, but real tolls were likely much higher due to the difficulty of accessing medical facilities.
Vaccines
The UN has pressed the warring sides to guarantee safe passage of aid after six of its trucks were looted.
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says some $14 million worth of food for the needy had been plundered, while UN children’s agency UNICEF said cold chain storages had been looted with more than 1 million polio vaccines destroyed.
“A number of cold chain facilities have been looted, damaged and destroyed, including over a million polio vaccines in South Darfur,” Hazel De Wet, deputy director of the Office of Emergency Programmes, UNICEF said.
Fighting has spread across the country, including the western region of Darfur.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR is estimating an exodus of 860,000 people from Sudan and called on governments to look kindly on fleeing civilians.
“We’re advising governments not to return people to Sudan,” Elizabeth Tan, UNHCR’s director of international protection, told reporters at a briefing in Geneva.
The UNHCR said more than 56,000 people had entered Egypt through the Qostol and Agreen crossings since May 4, including at least 52,500 Sudanese, according to figures from Egypt’s foreign ministry.
UN council session
The UN Human Rights Council on Friday said it would hold a special session on conflict-torn Sudan on May 11.
The gathering “to address the human rights impact of the ongoing conflict” will take place in Geneva following a request submitted Friday by Britain, Germany, Norway and the United States, which 52 countries have so far supported, the council said.

The case comes as Moscow has launched an unprecedented crackdown on dissent at home as troops fight in Ukraine and as much of the Russian arts community has fled the country.
The RIA Novosti news agency said the court ordered the 38-year-old to remain in custody until July 4.
The charges carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.
Berkovich and playwright Svetlana Petriychuk were detained a day earlier, a move that shocked Russia’s shrinking theatre community.
The women were accused of “justifying terrorism” in their play, Finist, the Brave Falcon. The women-only performance about Russian women who went to marry men in Syria won two prestigious Golden Mask theatre awards last year.

11,Charles helps rabbi respect sabbath rules at coronation,LONDON: Britain’s chief rabbi will join other faith leaders at Saturday’s coronation of King Charles III but...,"LONDON: Britain’s chief rabbi will join other faith leaders at Saturday’s coronation of King Charles III but faces a unique problem — how to ensure his attendance does not breach the Jewish Shabbat (sabbath).
Ephraim Mirvis on Friday praised the “respectful, sensitive” way that King Charles’s office had handled the situation — even inviting him to spend the night with his wife Valerie at St James’s Palace.
That will enable the chief rabbi to walk to the nearby Westminster Abbey on Saturday morning, rather than breaking Shabbat rules by using motorised transport.
A Kosher caterer has been brought in to prepare on Friday night dinner of coronation chicken, Mirvis told Sky News television.
After the Christian coronation service, the chief rabbi will join British Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist leaders in making a spoken declaration in unison towards their newly crowned monarch.
“It will be quite brief, but exceptionally powerful,” Mirvis said, while stressing that he was not required to speak into an electronic microphone in the abbey, again to respect the Jewish holy day.
The unprecedented joint declaration from the religious leaders reads: “Your Majesty, as neighbours in faith, we acknowledge the value of public service”.
“We unite with people of all faiths and beliefs in thanksgiving, and in service with you for the common good.” 
‘Defender of faith’
Mirvis consulted judges from Britain’s Beth Din Jewish court who agreed it was permissible to enter a Christian church on this Shabbat, out of respect for an invitation from the sovereign.
“This is a wonderful feature of 21st-century Bri­tain, and our king wants to champion the rights of members of all faiths to practise their religion,” the chief rabbi added.
“He did this marvellously while he was prince of Wales. He’s continuing now as the king,” he said.
“And it’s not just within the Jewish faith. I know that members of other faiths as well hugely appreciate this. 
And now to be included in the coronation service, it’s very special.” The service at Westminster Abbey will be overwhelmingly drawn from the Christian liturgy as Charles takes an oath to serve as “Defender of the (Protestant) Faith” and to protect the establis-hed Church of England.
