0,Trade delegation arriving in Pakistan on maiden Ethiopian Airlines flight on 9th,"ISLAMBAD: Ambassador of Ethiopia Jemal Beker Abdula on Friday said high-level official and business delegations 
...","ISLAMBAD: Ambassador of Ethiopia Jemal Beker Abdula on Friday said high-level official and business delegations 
from his country were arriving in Pakistan on May 9 to advance bilateral and multilateral cooperation in diverse fields.
“The delegations will reach Pakistan on a maiden Ethiopian Airlines flight, which is starting operations from Jinnah International Airport Karachi, where celebrations will be held to welcome high officials. 
“The launch of Ethiopian Airlines’ flights from Karachi to Addis Ababa was long in the making. It will open the gates for Pakistanis into Africa as well as Europe,” the envoy said.
Speaking at a news conference that coincided with Patriots’ Victory Day in Ethiopia, he said the 60-member delegation includes representatives of five major ministries, including Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Regional Integration, Ministry of Innovation Technology as well as high officials of the Investment Commission of Ethiopia and Industrial Park Development Corporation.
From the business side, he said it would represent multiple economic sectors of Ethiopia including agriculture and 
agro processing, pharmaceutical, textile, surgical equipment, sports, tourism, mining and ICT.
The ambassador said the official delegation would sign a memorandum of understanding with their counterparts in Pakistan in technology, tourism and other fields.
Announcing the official opening of the Ethiopian embassy in Islamabad, the envoy said trade agreements would also be signed between the business communities of both countries to boost the trade volume, which was minimal to this day. 
He said two business forums were also being organised in Karachi and Islamabad to bolster bilateral trade by strengthening trade and commerce ties between the two countries.
He urged the Pakistani business community to increase bilateral trade between the two countries since ongoing development in Ethiopia’s diverse economic sectors had really impressed them during their recent visit to the capital city Addis Ababa.
Likewise, the business community of Ethiopia also wants to develop business and trade ties with their counterparts in the country.
Giving details about the operations of Ethiopian airlines, the ambassador said that the Pan African service would fly four days a week to Addis Ababa. 
The only other destination Ethiopian airlines connected to the region was India. “The Ethiopian airlines was one of the instruments to connect the two countries that have enjoyed cordial relations for many years, establish people to people, institutional and business linkages,” Jemal Beker told journalists.
On the occasion, the ambassador also congratulated the people of Ethiopia on Patriots’ Victory Day which was being observed in his country to honour the veterans of resistance movement against Italy.

1,RDA approves preparation of Leh Expressway’s PC-I afresh,"New design for separation of storm water and sewage important to check flooding in nullah, meeting told","RAWALPINDI: Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA)’s governing body at a special session on Friday gave the go-ahead signal to re-plan PC-I of the Leh Expressway and Flood Channel Project with a focus on a flood mitigation plan in the nullah. 
The 62nd meeting of the governing body was held with Commissioner Rawalpindi Division Liaquat Ali Chatha in the chair. 
Though there is no chairman of the RDA, the session was held on special directions of Punjab government to approve the new plan for Leh Nullah Expressway and Flood Channel. 
RDA Director General Saif Anwar Jappa, Chief Engineer Dr Habibul Haq Randhawa and other members of the governing body were present on the occasion. 

New design for separation of storm water and sewage important to check flooding in nullah, meeting told

“The Punjab government wants to reduce the cost of the project and has decided to end the old plan made during the previous PTI government. In this regard, the government wants to pay attention to mitigation of flooding in monsoon season and separate the storm water coming from Margalla Hills and sewage of twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad,” said a senior official who attended the meeting.
The chief engineer told the meeting that a feasibility study and detailed design for the separation of storm water and sewage was important for Leh Nullah. For this purpose, there is a need to hire a consultant.
“We will hire the consultant to make a new plan soon and in this regard the services of a government agency will be hired. The plan will be made as soon as possible so work on the project will be started in the next fiscal year on a priority basis,” said the chief engineer while talking to Dawn.
He said that roads would be constructed on both sides of the nullah with a focus on flood control. 
The Leh Nullah Expressway and Flood Channel project worth Rs20 billion was initially launched in 2007 on a 50:50 cost sharing basis by the federal and Punjab governments. 
However, the project remained stalled at the initial stage due to insufficient fund allocation and was closed by the then PML-N Punjab government in November 2010. 
During the PTI tenure from 2018-2022, the project was revamped on the public-private partnership (PPP) mode by extending its length from Kattarian Bridge (IJP Road) to the high court (N-5). A transaction advisory consultant - Nespak-KPMG-Axis Law - was hired on December 7, 2019 for preparation of the project proposals.
It eventually emerged as a non-viable project on PPP mode owing to insufficient revenue generation and high cost. 
The projected toll generation was very limited and an alternative proposal to provide vacant land adjacent to Leh Nullah to the private party along with the development right was also considered.
However, the RDA had no land and had also no authority to sell/auction the land or carry out any construction activities. Considering all technical, financial and legal aspects, the project was declared not viable under the PPP mode.
As a result, the mode of financing was shifted from PPP to the annual development plan (ADP) financing and the scheme has been reflected in the current 2022-23 with an allocation of Rs50 million. 
Accordingly, the PPP P&M Board de-notified the project on the PPP mode on January 14, 2023.
The PC-I for the land acquisition and structure compensation was approved by Ecnec on December 22, 2021 and the administrative approval was issued on January 19, 2022.
Meanwhile, the RDA governing body approved hiring of the consultant for traffic management plan and study for Rawalpindi city (traffic coming from Islamabad and from Rawalpindi to Islamabad on all roads).
The RDA chief engineer informed the meeting that the population and traffic problem in Rawalpindi was increasing rapidly. He said the traffic plan was 20 years old and that a comprehensive traffic management was needed to solve the problem for which a consultant should be hired. 
The meeting was informed that Rawalpindi with a population exceeding 2.2 million was the third largest city of Punjab. The economy of Rawalpindi is interlinked with Islamabad and the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area is the country’s third largest area. The two cities, jointly known as the twin cities, are connected with a metro bus service. 
The existing transport system in Rawalpindi requires a major uplift in level of service and quality owing to rapid growth of urban population. There is no integrated traffic management plan devised for the city resulting into the traffic congestion at the main roads and markets of the city creating nuisance for the public.
Keeping in view the prolonged unresolved traffic issue of Rawalpindi city, the execution of the project is the need of the hour and its timely completion is crucial and critical.

2,Auction of vending points opposed,ISLAMABAD: Senate Standing Committee on Interior Chairman Mohsin Aziz expressed concerns over Capital Development...,"ISLAMABAD: Senate Standing Committee on Interior Chairman Mohsin Aziz expressed concerns over Capital Development Authority (CDA)’s plan to auction vending points from May 15 to 17 and sought its details.
“Such auctions will attract investors and rich segments of society who will definitely exploit the poor vendors and under-privileged class of society will be neglected,” he said in a press release.
He said the CDA’s advertisement for auctioning the vending points was against last month’s direction of the committee.  Mr Aziz said that in a meeting of the committee held on April 13, the issue of closure of Ehsas Programme was discussed and the CDA chairman had “categorically stated that the civic agency will extend the programme for poor vendors whose stalls were demolished. On the direction of the chair, a subcommittee was also constituted,” the statement said.
It added that the CDA chief was required to attend the meeting of the committee to be held on May 10 to brief the members about the initiative.
The civic agency is all set to auction 200 vending points on May 15, 16 and 17, out of the total 1,800 planned on a 10-year lease.
Apparently, this move will help the business community and small vendors are likely to get nothing as in open auction they cannot compete with businessmen.
An official said that the idea of having planned vending points was good as this will add beauty to Islamabad and will also end the culture of pick and choose allotment of kiosks/vending points. 
However, he said instead of an open auction, the CDA should allot the vending points under subsidised and controlled rates in a transparent manner so that poor people could also make a bid.

3,CDA mulling setting up district business centre along Margalla Avenue,ISLAMABAD: City managers are mulling to launch the city district business (CDB) along the newly-built Margalla...,"ISLAMABAD: City managers are mulling to launch the city district business (CDB) along the newly-built Margalla Avenue. The proposed business centre will be set up along the said avenue in Zone I of the city.
The proposal was also discussed in a board meeting held on Thursday.
“Yes, we are going to develop a business centre along the Margalla Avenue in Zone-I area only. We shared our plan with the board as well,” said Member (Planning) Waseem Hayat Bajwa.
Speaking to Dawn, he said the CDA had 1,000 to 1,500 kanals in the said area mostly in sector C-16, which would be developed for mix commercial use, mainly for apartments.
“Now, we are going to hire a consultant, who will design the area in question,” he said, adding that in the next phase, development work will begin. The official said the CDA was thinking about hiring government-owned consultant firms only.
The member planning said the civic body, after designing, would start development of the CDB and it would also offer apartments to overseas Pakistanis.
Islamabad has its city district business, known as Blue Area, and if the new plan was executed, the city would have another CBD.
CDA officials said the proposed site of the new CBD was comprised of two revenue estates - Mouza Badana Khurd and Sangjani. They said overall, the CDA had around 5,400 kanals, which was acquired through three different awards that included 340 kanals, which was acquired in 1968, while 4,500 kanals was acquired in 1991, (acquired for Khanpur Water Supply Project) and 561 kanals, which was acquired for C-16 in 2007.
The CDA’s acquired land falls in two zones – I and III. It is relevant to note here that according to existing CDA regulations, construction was not allowed in Zone III.
“Apparently, to avoid controversy, the CDA, which earlier intended to develop apartment schemes in both Zone I and III, is now only focusing on Zone I north of C-16, where regulations allow CDA to start construction work,” said an official.
It is relevant to note here that last year, CDA ambitiously attempted to launch the Gandhara Enclave Housing Project near GT road, but it faced resistance as the initial layout plan was falling in both Zone I and Zone III. Whereas, the land reserved for Sangjani water project also falls under it. 
The civic agency faced resistance from environmentalists and journalists as well, as the said project partially falls in Zone III, where construction was not allowed.
It seems that the CDA currently had shelved the said project and has now come up with CBD, only in Zone I.
In January this year, apparently to go through with the Gandhara project, the CDA had also moved a summary to the interior ministry for onward submission to the federal cabinet to make changes to regulations governing Zone III.
The summary proposes two options to the cabinet: either approve the proposed changes made by a committee headed by CDA’s member planning or constitute a commission led by a judge and supported by a technical team. “The ICT Zoning Regulations and subsequent efforts failed to address the issue of un-regulated settlements in Zone III, particularly the areas north of Zone I,” read the text of the summary.
It added that the southern boundary of Zone III beyond Margalla Hills National Park comprising acquired and un-acquired land was not properly delineated. 
“Thus, urban sprawl continued in the form of various settlements in Shah Allah Ditta, Sangjani, Jorikhas, Pandakurd and Chauntra etc. Also, the construction of Margalla Road from G.T. Road to D-12 may further exacerbate the situation in the form of haphazard ribbon development along the newly-constructed Margalla Avenue,” the summary had pleaded.
However, the said summary could not be presented before the cabinet and sources in CDA. It seems that the summary has been shelved. And now, the CDA has decided to launch CBD along the Margalla Road in Zone I only.

4,Punjab govt seeks report about case against Gandapur,Sources say the accused has not yet sought pre-arrest bail in the case.,"RAWALPINDI: A day after the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader, Ali Amin Gandapur, was released from Sukkur jail the Punjab government sought a report from Rawalpindi police regarding a criminal case that had been registered against him in March 2023.
The PTI leader and former federal minister for Kashmir Affair and Gilgit-Baltistan was wanted by Rawalpindi police in a criminal case registered against him with Nasrreabad police on March 19, 2023.
According to sources, the accused had not yet sought pre-arrest bail in the case.
The Naseerabad police had registered a case against 12 PTI leaders, including Mr Gandapur, a former aviation minister, ex-provincial law minister and former members of the Provincial Assembly, on the charges of restraining public movement, violating section 144 and shouting slogans against the government while heading towards Islamabad Judicial Complex on March 18, 2023. No arrests had been made by the police so far in the case.
The FIR was registered on the complaint of foot constable (FC) Jawad Anwar Mirza under sections 188, 341, 148, 149 and 186 of the PPC.
The complainant said that he was on duty on March, 18, 2023 when former prime minister Imran Khan was heading towards the judicial complex in Islamabad for a court hearing in a case.
He said since due to law and order situation, section 144 had been imposed in Rawalpindi-Islamabad, the PTI leaders with 150 to 200 workers, who were carrying long batons, gathered at motorway (M2) Toll Plaza and started shouting anti-government slogans and blocked the road.
The gathering turned into an unlawful assembly. The administration present there attempted to stop them from blocking the road and informed them that section 144 had already been imposed and gathering of more than four people was prohibited.
But they did not stop and continued shouting anti-government slogans while blocking the road for a long time. “Local leaders Ghulam Sarwar Khan and others along with workers blocked the road and violated section 144,” the complaint said in the FIR.
Mr Gandapur was arrested earlier this month and was released from Sukkur jail on Thursday after being granted bail.

High Commissioner of Bangladesh Ruhul Alam Siddique greeted federal ministers, ambassadors, high commissioners and members of service corps and close friends.
Mr Siddique and chief guest at the event, Minister for States and Frontier Regions Senator Mohammad Talha Mahmood delivered the opening remarks. The celebrations also marked diplomatic ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The event provided an opportunity for everyone to expand connections, talk about cultural traditions and strengthen bilateral ties.
Mr Siddique, in his opening remarks, said celebrations of the independence of Bangladesh during the last couple of years were especially significant, marking three major occasions.
“We celebrated the 100th birth anniversary of the father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. We celebrated the golden jubilee of the independence of Bangladesh and we celebrated the confirmation of Bangladesh’s graduation from a least developed country to a developing country,” he added.
“Bangladesh and Pakistan enjoyed a unique relationship based on shared history and commonality of faith and culture. The relationship was rooted in the common desire for realising the goals of regional peace, stability and socio-economic progress of the peoples of the two countries. I am happy to share that during FY of 2021-22, the bilateral trade between the two countries has grown over 45pc. Although, this trend has slowed during this fiscal year ending this June, due to the global economic downturn. I am hopeful that it will soon be restored to its upward trend. This has been an encouraging development and I hope that this trend in the bilateral trade between the two countries will continue in the days ahead,” he added.
In his speech, Mr Mahmood said cultures, history and geographic proximity was instrumental in shaping ties.
“We are committed towards taking our cordial relations to new heights. We must continue to work together in trade, cultural exchanges and people to people contacts,” he said.

6,"TTP forging nexus with Baloch separatists, militant groups: experts",PIPS joint director says Pakistan’s engagement with Taliban-led interim govt in Kabul is the ultimate solution to all problems.,"ISLAMABAD: Experts at a discussion warned that banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was forging nexus with Baloch separatists and local militant groups based in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, a development which will likely exacerbate the already precarious security situation in the country.
Unlike the past, this is for the first time that TTP has started carrying out terrorist attacks in Pashtoon areas of Balochistan, which is very disturbing, they said.
There is no clarity about Pakistan’s policy for Afghanistan and the ruling coalition in the centre is also unclear how to deal with the TTP since talks with the proscribed group failed last year, they added.
The consultation on “Afghan peace and reconciliation: Pakistan’s interests and policy options” was organised by Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS).
The representatives of political parties and civil society, academics, and journalists, among others, participated in the discussion. The main themes of the consultation included “Pak-Afghan bilateral relations: challenges and way forward” and “Emerging Afghan situation and its implications for the region.”
The speakers said TTP and other local militant groups were filling the space left by mainstream and nationalist political parties in KP as they were no longer only jihadi-religious groups. They said these militant groups now promoted political and nationalist thoughts to achieve their vested interests.
The Islamite militants, including TTP, and separatists have increased their attacks in Balochistan since Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021, said Adnan Aamir, a Quetta-based journalist who writes for international media.
He said the group for the first time has started carrying out attacks in the Pashtoon areas of the province.
“TTP has increased its footprints in the province as at least three local Baloch militant groups have recently joined it,” added Mr Aamir. He said the banned group was promoting its political agenda in the province by showing its sympathies for the people of Balochistan, which demonstrated that it wanted to increase its presence in the province.
Aqeel Yousafzai, Peshawar-based expert on Afghan affairs, said recent statements of TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud were political in nature and there was no mention of jihad in these. He added that the group had been introducing itself as a Pashtoon nationalist group for the last four years.
“The rhetoric of nationalist parties and militant groups like TTP is now the same,” he said, adding that this should be very alarming for the policymakers.
Mr Yousafzai said local militant and separatist groups had entered into some sort of understanding with TTP. He argued that the government should open its door for talks with all militant groups.
President International Research Council for Religious Affairs Mohammad Israr Madani said they would have to enhance people-to people contacts and trade to decrease hostility of Afghans towards Pakistan.
“There is a need for religious diplomacy and involvement of religious scholars in this regard,” he said.
Mr Madani said Pakistan should hold talks with Afghanistan continuously on different issues and these should not be limited to a single sitting. He also said Pakistan should make its border management policy people-friendly to facilitate the Afghan people.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) leader Hafiz Munir Ahmed opined that Pakistan’s Afghan policy should be led by civilian set-up and parliament. “Political parties should be given an opportunity to make such a policy.”
Director News and Current Affairs Pakistan Television (PTV) Aoun Sahi said there was confusion in Pakistan who would make a new Afghan policy as the previous one failed to produce results. “It is also unclear who is now leading any Afghan policy.”
Programme Adviser at Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES) Pakistan Hamayoun Khan added that there was an issue of mistrust between the two countries. He said Central Asia was a huge potential for Pakistan and Afghanistan and both countries could benefit from it if they improve their bilateral relations.
PIPS Joint Director Safdar Sial said that Pakistan’s engagement with Taliban-led interim government in Kabul was the ultimate solution to all problems. He suggested that the civilian government in Pakistan should take the ownership of Afghan policy, which should be led by parliament. He added that security agencies must have their input in it.

On the other hand, chairman Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Maulana Syed Mohammad Abdul Khubair Azad said the nation condoled the martyrdom of teachers in Kurrum district.
In a statement, he said the Pakistani nation also salutes army personnel martyred by terrorists in North Waziristan. He called for a high-level investigation over the killings and demanded that its findings be made public.
Meanwhile, speaking at the protest, which was organised by Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen (MWM), its chairman, Allama Nasir Abbas, said those responsible for maintaining security should be held accountable.
“We have been informing relevant circles about conspiracies being hatched to create insecurity in Parachinar but no one listened,” he said, adding that people belonging to both Shia and Sunni communities were living peacefully in Parachinar, and if there were any land disputes as claimed by police officials, they could be resolved through scrutiny of revenue records.
Meanwhile, in a statement, Shia Ulema Council leader Allama Sajid Ali Naqvi has criticised the authorities for trying to cover up the incident by terming it a “local land dispute”.
Mr Naqvi said re-emergence of religious extremism and terror was a sign of concern for the whole society and the authorities have to act fast to stop it.

Talking to journalists in Hassanabdal on Friday, Mr Kaira said the country was going through a difficult phase due to the ongoing political turmoil, adding that dialogue was the fundamental essence of democracy and it was the only way out to find a peaceful solution to crisis.
“It is high time to make decisions with logic and reason. The problems faced by the country demand all stakeholders to take decisions with patience, vision and tolerance,” he said.
While narrating details of the negotiation between government and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, he said it was decided that the government would present the budget for the next fiscal year and dissolve the assembly in the last week of October.
He said the opposition team was demanding dissolution of assembly during the first week of October but the statement of PTI chief Imran Khan the very next day demanding dissolving of the assembly before May 14 has put the judiciary, economy, country and democracy in a “difficult situation”. 
He said this was the time for the entire political leadership of the country to sit for talks.
“Despite the government’s willingness to engage in dialogue we could not evolve a consensus in the final round of dialogue,” he added.
Responding to a question, he said the government was gathering coalition partners on a single page prior to holding talks with the opposition. 
He rejected criticism by certain elements on the visit of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to India to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. He said Imran Khan’s government plunged Pakistan into multiple crises and the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) assumed power to save the country from default. 
He said that the PTI chief was doing politics furiously, ignoring the country’s overall situation. 
Mr Khan demands punishment for those who violated the Constitution, but he should also get ready for the consequences of violating the Constitution.

Locals of the area, which is close to Margalla Hills in the western side of the federal capital, staged a demonstration when MQM leaders visited the area and assured them that they would be supported. 
MQM leaders, who visited the area were Member of National Assembly (MNA) Abu Bakar, joint in-charge MQM Punjab Zahid Malik and secretary general Karamat Ali Sheikh.
“We will bring the issues of forced acquisition of land by the CDA before the PM,” said MQM leader Abu Bakar during the protest staged by the locals.
He said the Capital Development Authority (CDA) had announced the award of the land of sector C-13 in 2008 but local landholders have so far not been given the compensation amount against their lands and built-up properties.
Talking to Dawn, Zahid Malik said hundreds of locals of Shah Allah Ditta have not been given their due compensation against their lands and properties.
He said city managers have cordoned off the area and registered over 500 first investigation reports (FIRs) against those who came out of their houses and demanded their rights. “Recently, a woman gave birth to a baby at her home as she was scared of leaving her home to rush to the hospital,” he said.
The local leadership of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have not turned up there to listen to the voices of the locals.
As the MQM had already raised the issue on social media and in some relevant quarters including the National Assembly, the locals sought the party’s help to get their problems resolved.
Mr Malik said the MQM will soon present a report to the prime minister to apprise him about what the party called “injustice” to the locals.

12,Govt appreciated for increasing taxes on tobacco products,ISLAMABAD: Health and anti-tobacco activists have appreciated the government’s stance on increased tobacco taxes.,"ISLAMABAD: Health and anti-tobacco activists have appreciated the government’s stance on increased tobacco taxes.
During an event organised by Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc), health activists said the decision would help Pakistan’s economy provided that the government remained steadfast by not falling for the tobacco industry’s misinformation campaign. 
Country head of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK) Malik Imran said tobacco was the largest silent killer in Pakistan as above 170,000 people die due to tobacco use each year.
“This pandemic also causes an annual economic burden of Rs615 billion which is 1.6pc of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP). The industry claims to be the biggest major tax payer but revenue generated from the tobacco industry is only Rs120 billion,” he said, adding that on an average, Pakistani smokers spend 10pc of their monthly income on cigarettes.
Former technical head of Tobacco Control Cell of Ministry of Health Dr Ziauddin Islam mentioned that increased prices remain the most effective tool in keeping these products away from children and low-income groups.
He thanked the prime minister for increasing the federal excise duty (FED) on cigarettes in February and added that this good step should not remain a onetime activity. Taking into consideration, the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Pakistan should increase taxes on regular intervals so that inflation and per capita income is accounted for and Pakistanis remain protected from harms of tobacco products.
Khalil Ahmed Dogar, programme manager (Sparc) said that children of Pakistan are being targeted by the tobacco industry so that replacement smokers could be recruited. 
Around 1,200 Pakistani children between the ages of 6-15 years start smoking every day, he said.
