2,Govt denies wheat crisis in Sindh amid escalating flour prices,"Food Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla says provincial govt had imported 400,000 metric tons of wheat and flour price should be Rs125 per kg.","• Province imported 400,000 tonnes of wheat, minister tells PA
• Says flour price should be Rs125 per kg
KARACHI: While the price of flour has skyrocketed, the provincial food minister has informed the Sindh Assembly that there is no crisis of wheat in the province and the government has procured 1.4 million metric tons of wheat to avoid shortage.
The price of flour has increased to Rs160 per kilogram in Karachi. Millers have been complaining of non-availability of wheat for the past many days due to which many of them have shut their operations.
However, furnishing a policy statement on the floor of the house, Food Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that the provincial government had imported about 400,000 metric tons of wheat.
Mr Chawla, who also holds the portfolios of parliamentary affairs and excise and taxation department, insisted that there was no wheat crisis in the province.
He claimed that the price of flour should be Rs125 per kg.
Expressing his views on the issue of wheat, the minister had an exchange of harsh words with parliamentary party leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Khurram Sher Zaman.
The food minister denied that there was any wheat crisis in Sindh.
Later, while responding to written and verbal questions from lawmakers during Question Hour, Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that whatever the revenue was collected by the excise and taxation department went to the provincial government’s account.
He informed the house that the department had collected over Rs3 billion in 2017 which included the recovery of Rs1.78bn from Karachi. He said that Rs5bn was collected in 2022.
4.3m vehicles registered with Sindh excise dept
In reply to another query, he said that over 4.3 million vehicles were registered in the province.
Responding to a supplementary question, he said that four per cent tax was levied on vehicles above 1,600cc.
He said that the issue of non-custom paid vehicles pertained to Pakistan Customs and the provincial government did not have to do anything with it.
In response to another question, he said the provincial assembly had passed a new law regarding drugs, including ‘ice’. He said that many cases of ice had been processed.
“We seized a large quantity of ice-making materials in Karachi some eight months ago,” he said, adding that the value of the seized material was over Rs5bn in the international market.
While asking a supplementary question, PTI lawmaker Shahnawaz Jadoon said the menace of drugs had badly hit his constituency in Keamari.
He said that children of tender ages had also started using ice and other drugs in the vicinity where such substances were sold openly.
The PTI member said that when people asked the area police to take action against drug peddlers, they were told that it was the job of Anti-Narcotics Force.
The excise minister said that the police officials were wrong if they were telling people to go to the ANF for action against drug peddling.
“I am issuing instructions to my department right now in the regard,” he assured the PTI member.
He said that the police should take action against drug dealers.
Mr Chawla said that there were excise department rules for giving a licence for a liquor shop.
“No liquor shop can be opened near school,” he said, adding that no one was allowed to drink in public, even if he was a non-Muslim.
The provincial minister said that there had been complaints of drug use in educational institutions. He requested Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah to give a briefing in the house on the issue.
Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho told the house that the health department was opening a drug rehabilitation centre where the staff would also be trained.
She underlined the need and importance of launching an awareness campaign in schools and colleges. “Children should be told how bad drug addiction is for their health,” she said.
Minister Chawala said that a task force would be constituted to visit schools and colleges, adding that the terms of reference of the task force would also be framed.
Replying to a supplementary question, the excise minister said that the department did not have modern machines to detect drugs.
He said that he would put up a proposal for sniffer dogs to control the drug menace.
The sitting was adjourned to meet again on Monday.

The examinations will be conducted in two shifts for which the schedules have already been announced.
In Karachi, a total of 393,264 candidates belonging to science and general groups, including regular and private students, will appear in the exams to be conducted by the Board of Secondary Education Karachi (BSEK).
Speaking at a press conference at his office on Friday, BSEK chairman Syed Sharaf Ali Shah shared that the board had established 524 exam centres in the metropolis. Of the total centres spread over the seven districts of Karachi, 279 are for male students and 245 for females.
The number of students appearing this year are relatively more than previous years. 

Minister Rahoo asks KE to ensure uninterrupted power supply at all exam centres

It was also said that each examination centre will display clear instructions regarding conduct during the exams. Any type of electronic device such as a mobile phone or any cheating material is not allowed within the premises of the exam centres.
The BSEK has also issued letters to the commissioner of Karachi, Rangers director general, city police chief, directorate of education and private schools and other departments for extending foolproof security during the examinations. 
Apart from the enforcing of Section 144, photocopying machines are also to remain off and closed for any work during the exam time.
Also, the BSEK claimed to have devised an efficient system for the delivery of examination question papers and answer sheets to the hub centres by the officers of the board from where the centre superintendent and their representatives will receive the sealed papers with the authority letter to take them to their respective centres. 
Meanwhile, a vigilance officer and his team for each centre will reach there for monitoring half an hour before each exam to remain there throughout till the end. The officer will also be preparing a report regarding the conduct of each exam on a daily basis for the reporting cell.
Acting BSEK Secretary Syed Mohammed Ali Shaiq and acting supervisor of examinations Habibullah Suhag were also present on the occasion.
Facilities for students, increased security ordered
Universities and Boards Minister Mohammed Ismail Rahoo has asked the federal government and K-Electric to look into having an uninterrupted supply of electricity during the exams as having no power then will add to the burden and misery of the students in this heat. 
He also said the officers in charge of the examination centres will provide cool drinking water to the students and security will be tightened inside and outside the examination centres to prevent the “copy culture”.
He said vigilance teams have been formed for all examination centres while there will be a ban on the use of mobile phones by teachers and students at the examination centres.

7,Centre urged to reconsider hike in gas meter rent,KARACHI: The Sindh government has asked the federal government to reconsider the excessive increase in the gas meter...,"

The government has reportedly increased meter rent to Rs500 in the gas bills.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: The Sindh government has asked the federal government to reconsider the excessive increase in the gas meter rent as it has become burdensome for the domestic consumers to pay their gas bills.
In a letter to Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik, Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh expressed grave concern over decisions of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) for issuing exorbitant gas bills on account of slow meters and meter rent charges to the domestic consumers in the province without prior notice to the provincial government or information to public at large.
While the minister’s letter did not mention the exact increase, recently the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan issued a statement condemning a move to increase the meter rent of domestic consumers of the SSGC from Rs40 to Rs500 and demanded that the government take it back.
In his letter, the minister stated that the SSGC’s action would aggravate the living conditions of a large section of society by putting more economic pressure to their already hand-to-mouth existence.
“Keeping in view the given situation when it has become difficult for the common man to earn his bread and butter, at this point in time any action of increase in the utility bills of gas under the different heads will further add to the worries of the common man,” he wrote.
He said the provincial government had already brought in the notice of the federal government through a letter on Nov 25, 2022, for representation in the board of federal regulatory bodies.
The energy minister said that earlier in a letter on Oct 4, 2022, the provincial government highlighted the arbitrary role of the SSGC and lack of representation of Sindh. 
“It’s sad to say that due to sheer negligence to the provincial issues that all previous correspondence could not yield any response from the federal government,” he wrote.
Minister Shaikh in his letter also pointed out that Sindh was the largest producer of gas in the country, accounting for the share of almost 63 per cent of total gas production. He said Article 158 of the Constitution protected the Sindh’s inalienable right of preference for use of gas over other province.
“In view of the above situation, it is requested that the concerned federal entities including, the Ogra and the SSGC, may be directed to reconsider their decisions regarding the increased meter rent charges by inviting representation from the concerned provincial government and other relevant stakeholders,” he said.
The minister said the provincial government was of the view that in future, price mechanism needed to be fair enough based on rational grounds with input from all stakeholders in order to dispel the fear of undue high price to ease public sufferings.

8,Another suspected case of mpox detected at Karachi airport,"The 9-year-old girl, along with family, arrives from Jeddah; sources say NICH authorities couldn’t quarantine her as family denied permission.","KARACHI: Another child suspected of having monkeypox (mpox) reported at the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) on Friday.
The nine-year-old girl, along with her family, had arrived at Karachi airport from Jeddah. She is stated to have fever and skin lesions for the past several days. She was immediately referred to the NICH.
Sources said that NICH authorities couldn’t quarantine her as the family simply denied permission for isolation at the hospital. None of her other family members were suspected of mpox.
Her samples have been sent to the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) for analysis. 
“She was stable and had no fever when she reported at the hospital along with her grandfather,” shared NICH deputy director Dr Liaquat Ali Halo.

Patient along with family arrives from Jeddah 

On the family’s decision to take the girl home, he said the experts counselled the family about the precautions they needed to take at the place of their residence.
“We couldn’t force them to do what we believe was right because this could have created an untoward situation,” he said.
According to experts, mpox cases in Pakistan, suspected or otherwise, are generally originating from Saudi Arabia because people from around the world, including parts of central and west Africa where the disease has been re-emerging in recent years, arrive for religious pilgrimage.
Mpox, they say, has low mortality risk and more than 90 per cent of survivors have no complications. However, the viral infection is highly contagious and can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact. Even the last lesion can infect and contaminate.
“A person with mpox can spread it to others from the time symptoms start until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed. As of February 2023, new data show that some people can spread mpox to others from one to four days before their symptoms appear,” says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US.
According to the WHO, people can contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linens, through sharps injuries in health care, or in community setting such as tattoo parlours.
Recently, a seven-year-old child suspected of having mpox found to have complicated chickenpox. The patient had no history of travelling to any high-risk country.
Pakistan has so far reported three confirmed cases of mpox; two in Islamabad and one in Karachi.
Meanwhile, the provincial health department conducted a refresher training course on mpox surveillance, response and sampling technique for the rapid response teams at Jinnah International Airport.
The aim was to enhance the capabilities of the 40 deputed rapid response teams; 20 doctors and 20 paramedics, including the focal person Dr Syed Zafar Mehdi, stationed at the airport.
The training covered sampling techniques, safety measures and safe transportation of samples to laboratories.

A sessions/model court (west) had sentenced Anjum Aijaz and Sarfaraz alias Muna to death in August last year for killing 10-year-old Ali Asghar in July 2019 in Saeedabad. The trial court had acquitted the underage co-accused Awais, a relative of the appellants. 
The convicts, through their counsel, challenged the trial court’s order before the high court and after hearing both sides and examining the evidence, a division bench comprising Justice K. K. Agha and Justice Khadim Hussain Tunio converted the death sentence into life term.
The bench in its order observed that evidence of three eyewitnesses emerged as particularly compelling and their testimonies in conjunction with the medical evidence form a coherent and consistent narrative about involvement of appellants in the crime.
About the acquittal of juvenile accused by the trial court, it noted the role assigned to him was mere presence with a shard of broken glass and his presence in itself was also doubtful in the light of the statements of two eyewitnesses.
The bench further said that both appellants have committed heinous crime, but court must remain steadfast in its duty to satisfy the scales of justice, and that the punishment meted out to the appellants was commensurate with their respective roles.
“The imposition of the death sentence upon both appellants may appear harsh, particularly when no specific injury is attributed to Sarfaraz and Anjum Aijaz’s role is limited to holding the deceased down during the attack,” it added.
The verdict said that considering their individual involvement in the crime, the appropriate punishment for appellants would be life imprisonment.
According to the prosecution, the accused persons had attacked the victim with wielded shards of glass outside his house.

10,Administrative work at KU suffers as non-teaching employees go on strike,VC tells stakeholders varsity can’t pay leave encashment to staffers,"KARACHI: Administrative work at Karachi University (KU) remained disrupted on Friday as majority of the non-teaching staff members opted to join the pen-down strike announced a day earlier in favour of their leave encashment demand.
The disgruntled staffers, however, didn’t hinder academic activities or students’ transport service.
The strike followed a series of demonstrations, sit-ins and rallies over leave encashment on the campus.
Sources said that the KU administration this year hadn’t released leave encashment to any employees, including teachers, on the ground that the university was facing a financial crisis, particularly after the Higher Education Commission deducted a huge sum from its allocated funds.

VC tells stakeholders varsity can’t pay leave encashment to staffers

Meanwhile, KU Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Iraqi held a meeting with representatives of the non-teaching staff, teachers and officers’ association and discussed proposals on how to address employees’ grievances.
The sources said the Karachi University Teachers’ Society and representatives of officers’ association endorsed the VC’s argument that coffers of the university were empty right now.
“The vice chancellor was of the opinion that the institution is in no position to pay leave encashment to its employees, a large number of whom have been recruited against rules,” shared an attendee, adding that the other side held the university administration responsible for making appointments on political grounds.
The vice chancellor, however, suggested formation of a committee comprising representatives of all the stakeholders to carry out an audit and see whether funds were available for payment of leave encashment or not.
“We couldn’t agree to this recommendation straight away as currently the non-teaching staff has no elected representation. Hence, we informed the meeting that this proposal would be discussed at a general body meeting to be held on Monday,” Tariq Shah, one of the attendees, told Dawn.

As soon as the freed persons, Shoukat and Amjad, belonging to the Solangi community, boarded a car to go back home, armed suspects riding two cars waylaid them and fired a volley of shots on the vehicle. 
Both the Solangis and three brothers, Majid, Akhlaq and Najam, who belonged to the Chandio community and had come to the jail to receive the prisoners on their release, died on the spot. 
Officials at the Waleed police station believed that the attack was carried out at the behest of the Solangis’ rivals in a murder case. They said Shoukat and Amjad were accused of killing two members of the Mugheri community and an FIR (No. 101/2021) was registered against them at the Warah police station of Qambar-Shahdadkot district.
The Solangi and Mugheri communities are residents of Mian Ratto village located near Lalurounk town in Qambar-Shahdadkot district and had been daggers drawn over the murder of two Mugheris some time ago.  
The fresh attack caused great panic and fear in the areas around the prison.
The Waleed police rushed to the crime scene and took the five bodies to the Chandka Medical College Hospital for a postmortem examination.
They immediately cordoned off the area and sealed off the exit/entry points to prevent the killers from fleeing their jurisdiction.
The Larkana SSP has set up several teams to trace out and apprehend the culprits. 
Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Faryal Talupr took notice of the incident and asked the senior police officers to ensure early arrest of the killers.

HRCP coordinator Tahira Habib said that participation of women from minorities in local government institutions should be increased. She said this segment should also be given due representation in the national and provincial assemblies. Women empowerment is necessary to enable them to play their due role in society, according to her.
Sindhi Aurat Tanzeem leader Nazeer Qureshi expressed her concern over Hindu community’s claims about ‘forced’ conversion of its girls in the province. She said rights bodies and government should play their role in this regard. She said women should be given maximum opportunities to participate in local government affairs as it was necessary for their empowerment.
Former Sindh Assembly member Farheen Mughal said that women should contest on general seats instead of going for reserved seats. She said that laws against harassment of women should be made tougher and implemented.

HRCP session discusses rights of women, special citizens, minorities and transgender persons

Transgender person Madiha Shah said that her community was the worst-hit segment. She said transgender people faced a worst form of exploitation and humiliation in society. “This society doesn’t give any importance to us and our rights. Implementation of laws relating to our community has not been done yet by government,” she said. She stressed that transgender people must be treated as equal citizens of the state.
Lal Mohammad, representing special citizens, said that nine million physically-challenged people lived in Sindh and this number could be even higher. “This society can become strong when its institutions will be made strong,” he said.
Advocate Yawar Qureshi said that government must give due importance to the LG system to protect vulnerable segments including women, haris, labourers and transgender persons. He said if LGs were made strong, then many issues would stand resolved.
Shahnaz Sheedi said that it was difficult to talk about women’s rights in this male-dominated society. If women stood up, then they would certainly get their rights, she said, and regretted that society remained indifferent to the rights of transgender and physically-challenged segments.
Senior journalists Ishaq Mangrio and Junaid Khanzada said that rights bodies should strive for the rights of vulnerable groups at union council level and if budgets were spent transparently, then many problems would be resolved at local level. They said that democratic governments could not evolve a strong LG system. They supported the view that transgender persons should also be made part of LGs to save them from discrimination.

The new species of birds included knob-billed duck, Indian spot-billed duck, black stork, lesser flamingo, pin-tailed snipe, parasitic Jaeger, crested Jaeger and cotton teal besides 41 regularly visiting waterfowls. 
“The number of birds last year was 61,000 on their conventional sites and this year their number was 13,000. But this doesn’t mean the number has dropped. There is always strong possibility that when the teams visited the sites the birds must be in the air and landed there after the teams had left,” he said.
