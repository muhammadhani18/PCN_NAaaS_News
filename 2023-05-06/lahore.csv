According to the district police spokesperson, Uch Sharif police were informed before Dawn that a gang of dacoits had blocked the Jalalpur Road by placing logs and was looting the passersby, including motorists.  
Acting on the information, a police party rushed to Nanda Lal Chowk and cordoned off the entire area.  
As the dacoits saw the police, they opened fire on them that was retaliated.  
This led to crossfie between the police and the dacoits, who also damaged a police vehicle by firing at it.  
As the firing came to a halt, one of the alleged dacoits, later identified as Sajid, was found lying dead at the scene.  
The police claimed he was killed in the firing by his own accomplices, who managed to flee the scene.  
The police shifted the body to Uch Sharif Rural Health Centre (RHC) for the postmortem examination.  
The police also claimed to have recovered an unlicenced revolver near the body of the dacoit who, they said, was wanted in a number of heinous crimes cases registered in various police stations.
The police registered a case against the fleeing dacoits and were conducting raids in the area to arrest them.

2,Regulation of street hawkers in the works,Govt launches business development plan for vendors,"LAHORE: The Punjab government announced on Friday the launch of a business development plan for street hawkers and vendors through registration and regularisation of their carts. 
In a meeting on Friday, Punjab Local Government Minister Ibrahim Murad directed Chief Minister’s Office Special Monitoring Unit to prepare a workable roadmap for the issuance of licenses to street carts on a yearly basis. 
The minister also suggested exploring the possibility of introducing modern design mobile carts in specified zones in major cities, following the pattern of developed countries.
Minister Murad stated that the registration of carts would enhance the self-respect of vendors and hawkers while providing them with a sense of security. 

Govt launches business development plan for vendors

The installation of number plates on their carts would protect owners from extortion and blackmail by various government officials, he added.
The minister further highlighted that the payment of an annual license fee, although nominal, would contribute to the national exchequer. Allocating spaces for these carts along busy roads would also improve traffic flow. If the plan succeeds, new carts would be allowed to operate alongside roads, thereby creating employment opportunities for people.

They also emphasised the promotion of rooftop gardening in high-rise buildings. 
Additionally, the respective directorates were urged to launch an operation to curb illegal constructions in housing schemes.
Furthermore, it was decided to organise seminars, meetings, and media campaigns to raise public awareness about the impacts of climate change, smog, pollution, etc.

3,Verdict reserved on PTI pleas against Zaman Park JIT,Petitioners counsel argued that the police included the offence of terrorism in the cases beyond the facts..,"LAHORE: A Lahore High Court full bench on Friday reserved its verdict on petitions of PTI leaders challenging the constitution of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to investigate the cases of violence and attack on police teams outside the Zaman Park residence of former prime minister Imran Khan.
During the concluding arguments, an additional advocate general said the courts are supposed to describe what the law is and should avoid saying what the law would be.
Reiterating his stance on the procedure to form a JIT, he said the provincial government did not nominate names of the representatives from the agencies working under the domain of the federal government but only asked the latter to appoint its nominee for a team.
He said a prior approval of the federal government would complicate the procedure.
An additional secretary for home said the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) adopted the same procedure for the constitution of the JITs in the past. He said the procedure had been in practice since 1997. However, he said there was still room for improvement in the rules.
Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, the head of the bench, observed that the petitioners had grievances against some of the members of the JIT.
A counsel for the petitioners also argued that the police included the offence of terrorism in the cases beyond the facts.
The law officer said the police teams were attacked with petrol bombs and stones. He said there was information of armed workers inside and outside the Zaman Park house of the PTI chief.
The petitioners’ counsel said the whole world witnessed what the police did outside Zaman Park.
The judge said all saw what happened there. He observed that the court would like to know the reasons behind the constitution of the JIT and the rules exercised by the government.
The bench reserved its verdict as both sides concluded their arguments.
Justice Farooq Haider and Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq are the other members of the bench.
The petitions were filed by Dr Yasmin Rashid, Musarrat Jamshed Cheema and Fawad Chaudhry.
The petitioners submitted that the police registered politically motivated cases against the PTI leaders and constituted an illegal JIT for the investigation. They said the police unlawfully inserted provisions of the anti-terrorism law in the cases.
They asked the court to set aside the notification of the formation of the JIT and also the call-up notices issued to them and other leaders of the PTI.
The home department had formed a six-member JIT with SSP Imran Kishwar its convener. Other members include SP Aftab Phularwan and one each representative from three intelligence agencies.

Earlier, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh turned down a request by the ACE lawyer to withdraw the stay order.

He said the ACE officials should not close their eyes after seeing what happened at the house of PTI central president Parvez Elahi.
The judge said nothing would happen if the arrest was not made till Monday.

Justice Sheikh reminded the petitioner’s counsel that law was equal for all and his client should not have any misconception.
The counsel said the petitioner visited the office of the ACE and stayed there for three hours but he was told that there was no case against him.
The judge extended the stay order and referred the petitioner to a full bench already hearing similar matters.

7,Imran’s plea against Shehbaz in defamation suit dismissed,LAHORE: A sessions court on Friday turned down a request of PTI Chairman Imran Khan to dismiss a Rs10bn defamation...,"LAHORE: A sessions court on Friday turned down a request of PTI Chairman Imran Khan to dismiss a Rs10bn defamation suit against him being pursued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for the last six years and directed the latter to present his evidence.
Through an application, Khan’s counsel pleaded that the court on Dec 18, 2021 directed both parties to file their interrogatories. He said his client filed the same on Feb 2, 2022 and the court directed the plaintiff (Shehbaz) to file his interrogatories on the same date.
He said the plaintiff after availing a number of opportunities failed to file reply of the interrogatories in the form and manner required by the rules of the civil procedure code (CPC) and within the time specified by the court.
The PTI chief’s counsel argued that the defamation suit of PM Shehbaz was liable to be dismissed.
On the other hand, Shehbaz’s counsel opposed the application raising objections on the merits. He said the defendant filed the application only to delay the suit proceedings and frustrate the process of the court.
He pointed out that Shehbaz had submitted his interrogatories the very next day after the defendant filed his own while a reply was filed on March 16, 2022. He said the PTI chief had already lost his right to defend the suit through an order passed by the trial court on Nov 24, 2022, which was also upheld by the Lahore High Court and the Supreme Court as well.
He argued that the defendant had no right to file such applications to hinder the process of the adjudication of the suit.
In his written order, Additional District & Sessions Judge Muhammad Irfan Basra noted that the reply of the plaintiff (Shehbaz) was filed on March 16, 2023 though was not in the shape of an affidavit as prescribed in the law.
The judge said the plaintiff may be required to remove the defect as the same is curable.
However, the judge observed that the plaintiff had already filed the reply to the interrogatories of the defendant on a prescribed form on April 6, 2022.
The judge observed that the formal defect had already been rectified.
“In these circumstances, this application holds no ground, hence, the same is dismissed,” the judge said in the order.
The judge adjourned the hearing of the suit till May 20 for the evidence of the plaintiff.
PM Shehbaz had filed the defamation suit in 2017 for the recovery of damages from Khan for accusing him of offering the latter Rs10bn through a common friend in exchange for withdrawing the case of Panama Papers pending before the Supreme Court.
The plaintiff said Khan leveled baseless allegations on him of offering the latter money through a friend for withdrawing the Panama Papers case.
He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10billion as compensation from Khan for publication of defamatory content.
The former prime minister had filed his reply to the main suit with a delay of four years in 2021 saying one of his friends told him that someone known to him and also the Sharif family approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama case.
Khan said he disclosed the incident for the consumption of the public at large and in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation.
The reply maintained that Khan did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (Shehbaz) while narrating the incident.

The PHC officers expressed their displeasure hours after a chief executive officers (CEOs) conference where the health minister snubbed the commission for sealing the premises of some private hospitals and laboratories.
A senior PHC official declared the caretaker health minister’s decision as “undue interference” in the affairs of an independent institution.
Seeking anonymity, he tells Dawn that the PHC was set up to ensure quality healthcare service delivery at all levels and to protect the well-being of the patients, by promulgating the PHC Act, 2010.
He says the commission is being run by a high-powered board of commissioners, comprising qualified professionals from the field of medicine, law, public administration and education.
He said the PHC used to seal the labs and public as well as private health facilities, following due process over serious violations, including maladministration and malpractices.
The official says no individual has the right to slap a ban on PHC action or issue it directions to change its policies, without approval from its board of commissioners.
He says it will be an unnecessary interference in the PHC matters and a challenge to its the autonomy.
He adds that the health minister’s direction may also create doubts over all the previous action taken by the commission including sealing of the labs and healthcare facilities.
In the past, the PHC had sealed operation theatres of different major public sector teaching hospitals of Lahore for violating the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and guidelines.
In the last October, he says, the commission had sealed three operation theatres and banned the admission of patients to a private hospital for carrying out a flawed procedure, resulting in death of a patient.
The official says a PHC investigation team had visited the facility and found that it lacked an emergency setup, an intensive care unit (ICU) and arrangements for referring patients.
Similarly, the record relating to compliance with infection control protocols and plans was found deficient.
Moreover, no documentary evidence of 24-hour medical coverage and waste disposal was available, he said, adding that the PHC had faced a tremendous external pressure for relaxing the punishment handed down to the facility, but it refused to budge.
He says the private healthcare establishments have been showing annoyance over the commission’s strict policies for protection of the patients’ rights.
The official laments that the the minister’s directions will encourage the private laboratories and healthcare establishments committing serious violations of SOPs while handling the patients.
About the minister’s directions, a spokesperson for the health department says Dr Nasir issued these directions at the 13th CEOs Health Conference held at a local hotel, where Punjab primary and secondary healthcare department Secretary Mr Ali Jan  and other senior officers were also present.
Dr Nasir only urged the PHC to serve notices on the laboratories before sealing them, in case of receipt of complaints, he adds.
He says the health minister has declared that the laboratories not following the SOPs developed by the commission, may be slapped fines, instead of being sealed.
He says Dr Nasir also directed the health department and the PHC to crack down on quacks in the province.

Earlier, an additional advocate general submitted copies of the unconditional apologies on behalf of ACE Director General Sohail Zafar Chattha, Additional Director General Waqasul Hassan, SSP Operations Sohaib Ashraf and Model Town SP Ammara Sherazi.
All the officers were also present in the court of Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.
The law officer also amended the text of the apologies on behalf of the officers after the judge expressed his dissatisfaction.
The ACE officials said they had already sought a public apology.
The judge observed that the court had not asked the officials to seek a public apology.
The judge reserved the verdict on the contempt petition of Elahi.
Parvez Elahi through a counsel contended that the ACE and the police attacked his house in the midnight to arrest him despite a pre-arrest bail granted to him by the high court. He said his family members showed the police the bail granting order of the court but they barged into the house.
He said the act of the respondent officials amounted to contempt of court and they were liable to be punished under the law.

Similarly, the department has also decided to upgrade all the police service centres of Punjab. 
The decisions were made in a meeting chaired by Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar here on Friday.

Mr Anwar said the promotions on new seats would not put an additional burden on the government’s treasury, rather these promotions would be given on already vacant seats in the system. He said nearly 10,000 employees had already been given promotions in the first phase during the last two months.  
The second phase of promotions is about to start from this month, for which he has assigned tasks to the police officers concerned to complete the work. 
The IGP said timely promotion was the right of every employee and all senior officers were bound to write the annual confidential reports (ACRs) on time. 
About the other initiative, he said it has been proposed to upgrade all the Police Service Centres of the province, making the modern software their main feature. 
Under the new system, the citizens would avail facilities of artificial intelligence and the verification of the citizens coming to police Khidmat Marakiz would be done by the data analysis and verification system of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra).  
He further said that modern data analysis software had been activated in all the Police Service Centers where online facilities related to police were being provided to the citizens under one roof. He has issued directions to make all the Police Service Centers operational 24/7 to provide facilities to the citizens. 
Meanwhile, a Punjab police spokesperson said the IGP has approved Rs66m for buying new houses for the heirs of Shaheed Constable Muhammad Ramzan of Lahore police and Sub-Inspector Muhammad Hayat Khan of Bhakkar police. 
He has also approved Rs2.7m for the assistance of 14 police officials declared ‘Ghazi’ by the Lahore, Rawalpindi and Rahim Yar Khan police. 
Furthermore, the spokesperson said, the police chief took notice of the viral video of 15-year-old Asad Ali in which he was being stripped naked in Pakpattan. He said the Pakpattan police arrested all the suspects involved in the incident. They were identified as Mudassar, Zaheer, Ali Haider and Yazman.

Police sources said no case had been lodged against ex-CM’s aide Dr Zain Ali Bhatti, whose house was raided by police.  
Former CM and president of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chaudhry Parvez Elahi has condemned the raid on the house of his aide “without any arrest warrants” and said police had been trying to harass Mr Bhatti and his family for staging protest against the alleged kidnapping of Sohail Asghar. 

No arrest could be made in the Gujranwala raid

Terming the raid an illegal act of the police, Mr Elahi said Bhatti was never wanted in any case, but he was being hounded for expressing solidarity with the family and children of the “kidnapped” assistant of his son, alleged the raid was contempt of court. 
Gujranwala City Police Officer Ayyaz Saleem later told the presser on Friday that police might have raided Mr Bhatti’s house in search of the fleeing suspect. 
Dr Zain Bhatti had joined the PML-Q a few years ago and joined the PTI after Parvez Elahi announced merger of the both parties. 
The law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have been conducting raids on the houses of former Punjab CM and his associates in Gujrat, Gujranwala and Mandi Bahauddin region for the last few weeks. However, they failed to make any arrest in these raids. 
Another close aide of Mr Elahi, Amjad Parvez Butt, has been missing for over a week after his car was found abandoned in the parking of a shopping centre in Gujrat. 
Butt’s brother had filed a complaint with the local police, seeking registration of a kidnapping case against unidentified suspects. However, his family sources say that no progress has been made in this regard. 
Mr Butt’s wife had been appointed the first ever chairperson of Gujrat Solid Waste Management Company by Mr Elahi’s last government in Punjab, but her husband had been running the company for all practical purposes. 
Earlier, the personal secretaries of former federal minister Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain and his son Musa Elahi, Hameed Bhatti and Kamran Butt, respectively, had also gone “missing”, but returned home after almost a month-long “disappearance”. 
It is astonishing that despite the merger of PML-Q’s Parvez Elahi camp with the PTI, the local chapters of Imran Khan’s party in Gujrat and Gujranwala have raised no voice in the support of of the Chaudhrys group that has been facing hard times due to registration of cases and raids by the LEAs. 
However, those who had joined the PTI along with the Chaudhrys, have been staging protests in Lahore, Gujrat and Gujranwala.
