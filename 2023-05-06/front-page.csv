0,India’s sense of insecurity behind old mantra: FM Bilawal,Bilawal hits back after Jaishankar repeats cross-border attacks allegation at SCO ministers’ meeting.,"• Bilawal hits back after Jaishankar repeats cross-border attacks allegation at SCO ministers’ meeting
• New Delhi told to reverse August 2019 action in held Kashmir for revival of negotiations
KARACHI / NEW DELHI: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Friday called ‘a sense of insecurity’ as the reason behind incensed remarks by his Indian counterpart soon after he returned from Goa after attending an SCO conference.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said he had succeeded in “countering the false narrative” of Narendra Modi’s government that every Muslim was a terror suspect and exposing Delhi’s history of defiance of bilateral and international agreements.
The statement upon his return home from India follows an exchange at the SCO meeting of foreign ministers.
India’s Minister for External Affairs S. Jaishankar, in his remarks at the meet, said terrorism in all its forms, including cross-border terrorism, must be stopped, usually a reference to Pakistan.
“… We firmly believe that there can be no justification for terrorism and it must be stopped in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.”
In Goa earlier, Mr Jaish­a­nkar and Mr Bhutto-Zar­dari posed for a protocol picture but didn’t shake hands. There was shrill Indian media commentary about why there should not be talks and why the two shouldn’t even shake hands.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari resp­o­nded to his counterpart: “The collective security of our peoples is our joint responsibility. Terrorism continues to threaten global security.”
The remarks came before the punch line. “Let’s not get caught up in weaponising terrorism for diplomatic point-scoring.”
Pakistan has suffered greatly from terrorism. “When I speak on this topic, I do so not only as the foreign minister of Pakistan whose people have suffered the most in terms of number of attacks and number of casualties. I also speak as the son whose mother was assassinated at the hands of terrorists,” the Pakistani FM stated.
Separately, he raised the Kashmir issue and demanded restoration of statehood for resumption of talks.
In an interview with The Hindu in Goa, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said India’s decision to break up Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 made it “difficult” for those in Pakistan who advocated engagement in the past.
“The onus is on India to create a conducive environment for talks,” he said.
Mr Jaishankar respo­nded by saying that India-held Kashmir’s special status was “history” and alle­ging that Pakistan backed terrorists in Kashmir.
In his interaction with media at the old terminal of Quaid-i-Azam Interna­tional Airport, Mr Bhutto-Zardari referred to Pakis­tan’s principled position linking any change in policy towards India to the reversal of unilateral and illegal actions of August 2019.
 
 

When asked about his thoughts about Mr Jaishankar’s harsh comments about Pakistan, he responded with a broad smile on his face.
“There’s nothing but insecurity behind it,” he said. “The propaganda, which he [Indian FM] is toeing being a representative of the same party which has built all this narrative, is actually exposed by us. They have built this narrative full of lies which clubs every Muslim with a terrorist.”
He said whether there are Muslims from Pakistan or India. “But when the son of BB Shaheed [Benazir Bhutto] sits before them and world leaders as foreign minister of his country, this narrative fizzles out.”
He mentioned another reason behind the Indian FM’s angry tone and words, saying that was Pakistan’s successful advocacy of Kashmir cause and proving the history of neighbouring country’s defiance of the UN Security Council, international laws and bilateral agreements.
“Another lie of India which we exposed is its attitude of defiance,” said Mr. Bhutto-Zardari. “This isn’t possible that one fine morning you wake up, mark a circle on the map and then claim that Kashmir is ours. No, it can’t be. Whether it’s a resolution of the UN general assembly or its Security Council, you defy every agreement and international law. You never fulfil your bilateral or multilateral commitments. With our Kashmir cause perspective, we countered all these lies and propaganda which definitely hurts them.”
In his interview with The Hindu, Mr Bhutto-Zardari clarified that he had not requested any bilateral meeting with Mr Jaishankar as a result of the action in India-held Kashmir.
“There is genuine willingness on the Pakistan side, to address all issues and resolve all issues through dialogue. But the actions on August 5 really slammed the door shut on that process,” he said.
“We would like India, the Indian government to create an environment conducive to talks and as soon as we return to the status quo of August 4 2019, I believe we can engage in a meaningful dialogue.”

Several opposition parties in India have demanded the restoration of statehood for Jammu and Kashmir.
A recent addition to the list was former governor of the occupied territory Satya Pal Malik who said it was a mistake to break up the state.
To India’s contention that there can be no talks without an end to terrorism, and when asked about the recent attack on an Army vehicle that left five Indian soldiers dead in Poonch area of occupied Kashmir, the Pakistani FM said he condemns all terrorist acts “from India to the US”, and that no Indian official had blamed Pakistan for the attack in Poonch.
“The new unity government in Pakistan has taken this issue by the horns, we have rejected [former prime minister Imran] Khan’s policy of appeasement when it comes to this issue”, he said. But actions against LeT chief Hafiz Saeed and JeM chief Masood Azhar, wanted for the 2008 Mumbai attacks and 2000 Parliament attack, respectively, as had been demanded by the Financial Action Task Force, were pending as they are under trial and the matter is sub judice.
However, he raised the acquittals of suspects accused in the 2007 Samjhauta Express blasts in India, where Pakistani citizens died, asking why the government had not prosecuted the case further.
He denied that there were any back-channel talks ongoing between India and Pakistan at present, although he conceded that these had been “productive” in the past.

1,PTI chief summoned on 10th for Toshakhana indictment,ISLAMABAD: A trial court seized with the Toshakhana case summoned Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan...,"ISLAMABAD: A trial court seized with the Toshakhana case summoned Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan on May 10 for indictment.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Humayun Dilawar also ruled on Friday that the complaint filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking criminal proceedings against Mr Khan for concealing state gifts in his assets declarations was maintainable.
According to the ECP’s complaint, Mr Khan “has deliberately concealed the material facts by not disclosing the details of gifts…has also made evasive and ambiguous statement in his written reply that the gifts purchased by him during the financial year 2019-20 were further gifted by him or on his behalf to others”.
Advocate Khawaja Haris, representing the PTI’s chairman, argued against the maintainability of the petition before the ADSJ and on the jurisdiction of the trial court.
He contended before the court that the complaint against Mr Khan has been filed under Section 190-A of the Elections Act, 2017.
He read out Section 190 and 193 of the Elections Act and argued that the trial court cannot hear this matter unless the complaint is filed under the appropriate section of law.
The judge observed that the counsel for Mr Khan did not raise any objection against issuance of arrest warrants by the sessions court when former premier challenged these warrants before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
He asked Advocate Haris to conclude the arguments on the maintainability and jurisdiction of the court as the trial has already been delayed.
Mr Haris asked the court to treat Toshakhana case on a par with other routine cases pending before his court.
He argued that ECP lacks jurisdiction to proceed against a lawmaker for corrupt practice.
He said that the District Election Commissioner (DEC) filed the complaint before the sessions court without authorisation. During the hearing, when DEC Waqas Malik reached the courtroom, Advocate Haris said that at the time of filing the complaint, Mr Malik was not DEC and the signatures on the complaint filed before the sessions court are also different.
ECP lawyer Amjad Pervaiz cited a case related to Election Laws of 1996 and said the Supreme Court has ruled that sessions court has jurisdiction to entertain such matters. 
He pointed out that the court had summoned Mr Khan on December 15 last year, but could not proceed further.
He said the ECP conducted the scrutiny of Mr Khan’s assets declarations and its details were submitted in the court by an official of the commission.
He pointed out that the complaint against the PTI chairman was filed under Section 173 of the Elections Act and the sessions court could have decided this within 3 months.
According to him, the ECP has issued direction for filing criminal complaint against Mr Khan, hence, the complainant has completed all codal formalities.
Advocate Pervaiz concluded that the former prime minister’s objections on maintainability and jurisdiction has no legal backing and it is being done to delay the court’s proceeding.

2,Short-term inflation jumps to record 48.35pc,"SPI has steadily been on the rise since the start of Ramazan due to continued rupee devaluation, among other factors.","ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, based on the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), rose to a new high of 48.35 per cent for the week ending May 4, official data showed on Friday. 
However, on a week-on-week basis, the reading increased was 1.05pc, with food items getting costlier, particularly chicken, eggs, flour, wheat products, pulses, fruits, potatoes and meat. 
The SPI has steadily been on the rise since the start of Ramazan due to continued rupee devaluation, costly petrol prices, increase in sales tax and higher electricity charges. 
Of the 51 items in the SPI basket, prices of 30 goods soared, nine dropped and 12 remained unchanged compared to the previous week. 
During the week under review, the items whose prices increased the most over the same week a year ago were: wheat flour (177.6pc), potatoes (123­pc), gas charges for Q1 (108.38pc), tea (104.28pc), diesel (99.39pc), eggs (95.45pc), rice basmati broken (89.31pc), bananas (87.86pc), petrol (87.81pc), rice Irri-6/9 (84.43pc), pulse moong (68.44pc), bread (62.83pc) and pulse mash (60.59pc).

3,Senate passes SC review of judgements bill amid uproar,Opposition believes it is an attempt to reverse Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Friday passed the Supreme Court Review of Judgements and Orders Bill 2023 amid uproar by the opposition. 
The bill, brought to the House through supplementary agenda, was moved by Senator Irfanul Haque Siddiqui, who is believed to be a close confidant of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif. The House allowed its immediate consideration with a majority vote of 32-21.
The government claims that the bill, which has already been passed by the National Assembly, aims to facilitate and strengthen the Supreme Court in exercise of its powers to review judgements and orders. 
However, the opposition sees it as an attempt to reverse the disqualification of former premier Sharif.
Protests by the opposition began soon after the announcement of the supplementary agenda. PTI lawmakers chanted slogans against the “imported government” and gathered around the chairman’s podium. They tore apart copies of the agenda and demanded the bill be sent to the relevant standing committee.

Opposition believes it is an attempt to reverse Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification

The opposition lawmakers returned to their seats only after a motion was announced for voting on the suspension of rules to take up the supplementary agenda. 
‘Procedural in nature’
During the session, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar referred to Article 188 of the Constitution, saying it empowers the Supreme Court to review any judgement or order issued by it, subject to the provisions of any Act of Majlis-i-Shoora and any rules made by the Supreme Court. He stated that the latest legislation was procedural in nature.
He insisted that the legislation did not disrespect the judiciary in any way. He explained that the bill had four sections that were in line with Article 188 of the Constitution.
“Parliament has not encroached even a single inch, and will not step back an inch,” he declared amid an ongoing tussle between the government and the judiciary over polls as per the constitutional provision.
Leader of the Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem of PTI accused the government of using parliament as a shield to hide behind. “Stop playing with the Constitution,” he said.
He said the government was attempting to evade elections by using the pretext of parliament’s supremacy, in order to avoid a crushing defeat. 
Mr Waseem made it clear that the Constitution mandates the holding of elections within 90 days after the dissolution of an assembly, and that this requirement cannot be changed through speeches, resolutions, or even simple legislation.
“Where were these people when Qasim Suri’s ruling was thrown out? Was parliament not supreme at that time?” he questioned.
The PTI leader criticised the coalition leaders for their alleged disrespect to courts, and claimed that “Pakistan is currently functioning without a proper government”.
He also questioned how the budget could be passed when “there are no functioning governments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab”.
“These are just tactics to avoid elections,” he told the House.
The PTI senator pointed out that despite being shot at, party chairman Imran Khan was appearing before the courts.
The senator said: “There is this prime minister before you and then there is the one who is sitting abroad today,” referring to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif who is currently living in London. He then called on the government to show due respect to the judiciary. 
“You will have to accept and implement the Supreme Court’s order on elections no matter what,” emphasised.
The bill says it was necessary to ensure the fundamental right to justice by providing for a “meaningful review” of the apex court’s judgements and orders in the exercise of the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction, as described in Article 184 of the Constitution. It says that the scope of review on facts and law in case of apex court judgements and orders while exercising jurisdiction under Article 184, would be the same as an appeal under Article 185.
In addition, the bill specifies that a review petition must be heard by a larger bench than the one that passed the original judgement or order. It also grants the petitioner the right to appoint any advocate of the Supreme Court of their choice for the review petition.
The bill also extends the right to file a review petition to any aggrieved party against whom an order under Article 184(3) was issued before its commencement, provided that the review petition is filed within 60 days of the bill’s passing. It also sets a time limit of 60 days for filing a review petition from the date of the original order.
“The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, rules or regulations for the time being in force or judgement of any court including the Supreme Court and a high court.” It reads.
Meanwhile, PTI Senator Ejaz Chaudhry while speaking in the House said that the allegations made by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi regarding corruption in the flour scheme should be investigated. Ejaz Chaudhry said that there was once a foreign minister in this country, now there is a minister for pleasure trips, who had now gone to Goa beach.
He objected that the foreign minister could have attended the SCO meeting online, but he was in love with Narendra Modi. The House also passed The Private Power and Infrastructure Board Amendment Bill, 2023 and the Kalam Bibi International Women Institute, Bannu Bill 2023.

4,Apex court to issue ‘appropriate order’ on single-day polls,"CJP says court has kept cool as ""justice can’t be dispensed in rage"".","• CJP says court has kept cool as ‘justice can’t be dispensed in rage’
• Coalition tells court willing to continue talks with PTI
• Qureshi says no way out, terms govt ‘inflexible’
ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial cautioned on Friday that the court was exercising restraint and that no one should “misunderstand our intentions” but insisted that an “appropriate order” would be issued in the election schedule case.
Though Justice Bandial did not me­ntion or explain what he meant by this, his remarks apparently came against the backdrop of recent anti-judiciary rhetoric by several cabinet members.
“We are also willing to make sacrifices when people are giving sacrifices due to security issues,” he said. “We have kept our cool and chose not to respond to anything since justice cannot be dispensed in rage.”
The chief justice was heading a three-judge bench that had taken up a petition on simultaneous elections to the National and four provincial assemblies on the same date.
As the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition expre­ssed its willingness before the court that it was ready to sit and continue negotiations again, PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qureshi said he saw nothing coming out of the negotiations.
“I regret to say that I am surprised the way our parliamentarians are hurling abuses at the Constitution and the court,” he said, mentioning how even his own party members questioned his loyalty when he earlier agreed to give a break of three days to the PDM during negotiations.
Mr Qureshi also accused the gover­nment of pushing the country tow­ards a constitutional crisis and showing no flexibility during the negotiations.
The CJP, however, closed Friday’s proceedings with an observation that an appropriate order would be issued on single-day polls but said the court would take up the matter of its April 4 Punjab polls order in a different hearing.
During the hearing, Justice Ban­d­ial, while pointing towards PPP lawyer Farooq H. Naek, regretted that he should appreciate the conduct of the court and compare it with the level with which it was being targeted outside.
He regretted that the government did not want to discuss law but wanted to do politics, adding that earlier it was said politics had entered the judicial process, but “we chose not to respond to politics”.
“We are not politicians and will never answer to politics,” Justice Bandial said and reminded that judges had taken the oath to defend the Constitution at any cost.
Mr Naek tried to emphasise that after the 18th Amendment, elections had to be conducted by the caretaker governments after the dissolution of the assemblies. “Imagine what trouble will be in store for us if the election results are not accepted by the losing side in case a particular party ruled the Punjab and KP,” he said.
However, the chief justice regretted that the government did not take constitutional action seriously. He said the government was on a boycott when the case was being heard at the earlier stage.
The government remained engaged in the 4-3 debate instead of presenting facts before the court, the CJP said. He reminded that even Justice Athar Minallah on one point had suggested restoring Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, but the government was not interested.
He said the government’s seriousness could be gauged from the fact that only the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) moved a review petition challenging the April 4 order.
The court, he said, had to act in accordance with the law and the Constitution, adding that the court could have invoked other provisions of the Constitution, but “we desisted from doing it”.
Referring to the government’s contention about the country’s weak financial health, Justice Bandial observed that the court couldn’t close its eyes to the public interest and even couldn’t sit on the outcome of the dialogue if it did not bear fruit.
In view of the constitutional crisis along with ongoing economic, political, social, and security crises, the government and the opposition had to be serious, he said.
Earlier, PML-N’s Khawaja Saad Rafique told the court that his party had been at the receiving end since 2017 and that he was standing today before the court as a victim.
He said both the PTI and the government were sincere in dialogue and it was only a matter of days that a date for simultaneous elections would be decided.
Efforts should be made to insulate Punjab from allegations of dominance over smaller provinces, he said, adding that elections in the presence of a government of a particular party in Punjab and KP would create more bitterness since no one would accept election results.
Earlier, Mr Naek also read out the government’s report on negotiations stating that PTI members were told to avoid further economic deterioration because it was important that the agreement with the IMF was concluded before the annual budget.

5,Top lawyers’ bodies ‘in no mood’ to mend fences,"SCBA, PBC indulge in recriminations; efforts to broker truce ""yield no results""; SC maintains status quo on the issue.","ISLAMABAD: In what could be termed an extension of the bitter polarisation already plaguing the politics and the judiciary, the country’s two premier lawyer bodies have drawn daggers, with none ready to defuse the tensions.
The tussle between the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) unfurled on Thursday when the former issued show cause notices to and de-seated two SCBA officials — Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir and Malik Shakeelur Rehman.
In a tit-for-tat move, the SCBA also suspended the membership of the PBC executive committee members. The SCBA, through a hurriedly filed petition, brought the matter in front of the apex court, which after hearing the case on Friday maintained the status quo for the time being.
The acrimony worsened to such an extent on Friday that the SCBA placed one of its employees to watch that no PBC member should come close to its offices on the first floor of the Supreme Court building. Interestingly, the PBC office is also situated on the third floor of the same block.
After Friday’s hearing, SCBA President Abid S. Zuberi accused the PBC of interfering in the SCBA affairs. He claimed that the real reason behind the split between the two premier bodies was SCBA’s recent decision to conduct a forensic audit of the Supreme Court Bar Housing Society and probe the allegations of human smuggling conducted by certain PBC members.
He claimed that lawyers were yet to receive possession of the plots for which they paid almost eight years ago.

SCBA, PBC indulge in recriminations; efforts to broker truce ‘yield no results’; SC maintains status quo on the issue

The allegations
In its petition, the SCBA had challenged the PBC decision to issue show cause notices and de-seat its officials who also serve as SCBA secretary and additional secretary, respectively.
A senior PBC member denied the allegations, saying that the entire amount has been paid to the previous owners of the lands for taking possession. He said the SCBA office-bearers were de-seated for writing a “derogatory” letter to the PBC.
Mr Zuberi continued that the SCBA was being forced to follow government-dictated policies and the PBC’s executive committee appointed Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon and not him, the SCBA president, to represent the association before the Supreme Court in the matter of holding elections to the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) assemblies.
Meanwhile, Amjad Shah, who also served as PBC vice chairman from 2019 to 202, claimed that the SCBA considered PBC a hurdle as the latter always opposed the former’s attempt to pursue the dictates of a particular political party.
He regretted that instead of invoking the jurisdiction of PBC, an appellate authority of lawyers, the SCA chose to move a petition before the Supreme Court which was even fixed and heard on Friday without a number assigned to it.
Mr Shah said the SCBA called a meeting to take a decision on the housing society affair on April 29, at a time when the majority of the members had gone to Quetta for a lawyers’ convention.
There have also been attempts to end the acrimony, but they are yet to wield any results.
Under the relevant rules, a notice of 15 days or at least one week must be given so that members could attend the meeting from all over the country, Mr Shah said.
‘Unprecedented’ actions
Senior counsel Taufiq Asif told Dawn that he tried his best on Thursday last to convince both groups to forge unity, just like the lawyers united when the presidential reference was instituted against Justice Qazi Faez Isa.
“I tried to convince them that instead of fighting like PTI and PDM, we should settle differences by invoking a dispute resolution mechanism,” he said adding instead of heeding the advice, SCBA chose to file the petition before the Supreme Court.
When asked if SCBA could suspend members who were also part of the PBC, Mr Asif said this has never happened in the history of SCBA.
It is a matter of interpretation since the SCBA enjoyed certain administrative authority but such an extreme step has never been taken in the past, he said.
On Thursday, SCBA Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir suspended the membership of seven PBC executive committee members, namely Chairman Hassan Raza Pasha, members Syed Amjad Shah, Riazat Ali Sahar, Muhammad Tariq Afridi, Muhammad Masood Chishti, Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon and Syed Qalb-i-Hassan.
Mr Shabbir has also issued a statement saying the SCBA had told the Supreme Court that illegal orders and show cause notices issued by the PBC were against the law.
During the hearing on Friday, the two-judge SC bench, consisting of Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Ayesha A. Malik, noted that the SCBA president, Mr Zuberi, had filed an unnumbered application, which showed that during the pendency of this petition, PBC and its executive committee have already de-seated the secretary and the additional secretary and sent the matter to PBC’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings.
He said SCBA will always stand for the rule of law, the Constitution and the welfare of its members.
SC hearing
The SCBA counsel referred to Rule 118 of the Pakistan Legal Practitioner & Bar Council Rules, 1976 and argued that, under the rule, the only competent authority was the disciplinary committee where a complaint, if any, should have been filed to decide the matter.
The counsel contended that no specific rule or any section of the law was cited in the show cause notices.
When the court asked the counsel why the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) has been invoked directly rather than filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution, the counsel argued that certain dictums have been laid down by the Supreme Court wherein invoking of High Court jurisdiction was not approved.
In support of his contention, the counsel relied on a 2017 case, Muhammad Shoaib Shaheen vs PBC and another case, Syed Iqbal Hussain Shah Gillani vs PBC.
The counsel sought time till the next hearing when he was asked by the court to satisfy it on the maintainability of the petition under Article 184(3) which deals with the issues of public importance and fundamental rights.
The counsel argued that replies to the show cause notices were submitted but, without providing any hearing, the members were de-seated, in grave violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution.
After the illegal move, the matter was referred to the disciplinary committee, he continued.
The counsel requested that since the order of de-seating has not been implemented, it should be suspended.After hearing the arguments, the bench issued notices to Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan as well as PBC and its executive committee on the maintainability of the petition.
