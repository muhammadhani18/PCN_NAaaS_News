0,Pakistan needs to repay $3.7bn debt by June: Fitch,"However, the Fitch Ratings expects Pakistan and IMF to reach an agreement.","KARACHI: Pakistan needs to repay another $3.7 billion in external debt by the end of June 30 this year, Bloomberg reported on Friday.
During the entire current fiscal year, the country has been struggling to avoid default with the help of friendly countries and multilateral lending agencies but the next fiscal year is about to begin with another huge requirement of dollars.
In an interview with Bloomberg, a Fitch Rating official said Pakistan would have to repay $3.7bn up to June 2023. The Fitch official expects China would roll over a $2.4bn loan maturing next month.
According to the report, Pakistan has to pay $700m in May and $3bn in June. Despite support from Saudi Arabia and UAE, the IMF remained unsatisfied. Staff-level agreement for $1.1.bn could not be concluded.
The prime minister as well as the finance minister has been announcing that Pakistan has fulfilled all the pre-conditions to conclude the 9th review but the IMF is unmoved.
Former finance minister Miftah Ismail recently told a private TV channel that the IMF should release the tranche since all the conditions have been met. Delaying the release of the tranche would have a bad impact on the economy.
However, the Fitch Ratings expects Pakistan and IMF to reach an agreement. Pakistan already received financial commitments from Saudi Arabia and UAE, it said.
Independent economists and analysts believe that both the default and restructuring of external debts would be greatly harmful to the economy. With the support of China Pakistan has been striving to avoid both situations.
China’s foreign minister on Friday arrived in Islamabad on a two-day visit to discuss crucial matters including funding and loan rollovers.
Recently a high official from Pakistan visited China apparently to get support for the economy while the Chinese foreign minister is expected to announce some good news for the battered economy of Pakistan.
Beijing is the biggest trade partner of Islamabad but the balance of trade is grossly in favour of China. Pakistan has great scope to expand its exports to the second-largest economy in the world.
However, some experts maintain that Chinese power companies are not happy with the payment delays. The increasing power debt is a serious issue for China. Pakistan is also not allowing outflows of profits and dividends due to extremely poor foreign exchange reserves.

1,India considers foreign investment in N-power,"Under India’s Atomic Energy Act 1962, the govt plays a central role in developing and running nuclear power stations.","NEW DELHI: India is considering overturning a ban on foreign investment in its nuclear power industry and allowing greater participation by domestic private firms, two government sources told Reuters, as part of a push for cleaner energy.
The measures have been recommended by a government panel, set up by think-tank Niti Aayog which is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Under India’s Atomic Energy Act 1962, the government plays a central role in developing and running nuclear power stations. Domestic private companies are allowed to participate as “junior equity partners” by supplying components and helping build them.
The panel has recommended changes to the act and to India’s foreign investment policies so that both domestic and foreign private companies can complement nuclear power generation by public companies.

2,IMF insists on ‘pledges for financing’,Pakistan has announced pledges worth $3bn in financing support from Saudi Arabia and UAE but the funds have yet to come through.,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund is working with Pakistan to conclude a ninth review of a bailout programme, its mission chief said on Friday of the funding critical for the cash-strap­ped nation to avert an economic collapse.
Pakistan and the IMF have been discussing fiscal policy measures in the review since February, aiming to resume stalled funding of $1.1 billion due in November 2022 under a loan programme agreed in 2019.
The measures have fuelled the highest-ever inflation, posted at 36.4 per cent in April.
The IMF funding is crucial for Pakistan to avert a default on its external payment obligations during a balance of payment crisis, in which foreign exchange reserves have shrunk to just four weeks of controlled imports.
“The IMF continues to work with the Pakistani authorities to bring the ninth review to a conclusion once the necessary financing is in place and the agreement is finalised,” mission chief Nathan Porter said in a statement to Reuters.
“The IMF supports the authorities in the implementation of policies in the period ahead.” This included technical work to prepare the budget for 2023-24, set to be passed by the National Assembly before end-June, he added.
As part of the conditions, Pakistan has given an assurance that its balance of payments gap this fiscal year is fully funded.
Pakistan has announced pledges worth $3bn in financing support from Saudi Arabia and UAE, but the funds have yet to come through. Longtime ally China has rolled over and refinanced its loans.
Islamabad and the IMF have had differences over the gap. It was not clear if the Saudi, UAE and Chinese financing would be sufficient, or if more external support would be needed. It was also not immediately clear why the lender wanted to work on the technical preparation of the budget, which is not covered by the programme.
The step could be linked to a possible new IMF lending plan, said Yousuf Nazar, an economist and former head of equities and investments at Citigroup.
“I think it is unavoidable that they would like to ensure the government will meet its commitments particularly when it is in no position to repay the debt, which will inevitably need a new programme,” he told Reuters.

4,Stocks finish weekend session on bullish note,Overall trading volume decreases by 30.2pc to 178.2m shares.,"KARACHI: The business week ended on the Pakistan Stock Exchange on a bullish note even though investors’ engagement remained relatively low owing to the weekend factor.
Arif Habib Ltd said the index of representative shares fluctuated before the bulls became active in the post-prayer session, pushing up the index as well as the trading volume.
Investors added value to their portfolios by cherry-picking stocks with strong fundamentals. Shares belonging to the cement and banking sectors hogged the limelight.
Another factor driving the positive momentum on the stock exchange was the press coverage on the likely outcome of the overdue review of the International Monetary Fund loan programme.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 42,241.98 points, up 148.18 points or 0.35 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume decreased 30.2pc to 178.2 million shares. The traded value went down 37.7pc to $20.3m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (17m shares), Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (13.6m shares), TPL Properties Ltd (9.6m shares), Bank Alfalah Ltd (8.8m shares) and Air Link Communication Ltd (7.6m shares).
Sectors contributing the most to the index performance were commercial banking (56.6 points), power generation and distribution (56 points), fertiliser (28 points), exploration and production (24.7 points) and oil marketing (18.9 points).
Companies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs208.62), Bhanero Textile Mills Ltd (Rs79.74), Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd (Rs49.05), Khyber Textile Mills Ltd (Rs36.62) and Shield Corporation Ltd (Rs22).
Companies that reco­rded the biggest declines in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs192.50), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs24.30), JS Global Capital Company Ltd (Rs20.40), Murree Brewery Company Ltd (Rs17.19) and Hinopak Motors Ltd (Rs10.55).

5,Six projects worth Rs227bn cleared,Largest project worth Rs110.7bn involves emergency reconstruction related to damages caused by catastrophic 2022 floods in merged districts.,"ISLAMABAD: The Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on Friday cleared a total of six projects costing Rs227 billion, mostly in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Kashmir, including three larger projects that were referred to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for formal approval.
A meeting of the CDWP, presided over by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, approved three projects with a total estimated cost of about Rs21bn and cleared two other projects of about Rs207bn for formal approval by Ecnec.
Under the current financial rules, the CDWP is empowered to itself approve projects costing no more than Rs10bn while the projects of higher estimated costs are approved by Ecnec on its recommendations after clearance on technical grounds.
The meeting recommended the largest project among the agenda items — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rural Investment & Institutional Support Project — worth Rs110.7bn in principle to the Ecnec for approval with the condition that its cost be rationalised.
The project is partly funded by the World Bank with a $200 million (about Rs56bn) loan to be implemented under a multi-phase programme over nine years with greater emphasis on the development and mainstreaming of the formerly tribal region covering 14 districts including eight new merged in the KP and six other frontier regions.
The project involves emergency reconstruction in the first phase related to damages caused by catastrophic 2022 floods in merged districts and then filling the development gaps. The interventions will prioritise building citizen-state relationships through strengthening the lowest tier of government and extending state systems and government presence to facilitate and ease service delivery challenges in eight newly merged districts and six frontier regions where the development gaps are largest.
The CDWP meeting rejected a cost escalation of over Rs20bn in the Mangla Dam Raising project to Rs116bn involving some additional works and services and directed the already completed project to be closed at an estimated cost of Rs96bn. This would now be formally approved by the Ecnec for closure with directives that additional works mostly related to penalties, legal services and a nullah development should be done by Azad Kashmir, Wapda and other agencies depending on their respective responsibilities as they had nothing to do with Public Sector Development Programme.
The meeting also cleared National Oilseed Enchantment Program at the cost of Rs10.96bn while adding the Sindh Component to the project already approved by the Ecnec. The National Food Security and Research Division is the sponsoring agency of the project. The key objectives of the project include increasing the phase-wise yield of three potential crops canola, sunflower and sesame to enhance the export potential of sesame seed and to encourage oilseed growers through subsidy on seed, inputs and machinery and appreciation awards and to encourage the solvent industry to procure farmers produces at a competitive price and establish procurement centre in major growing areas.
The CDWP approved three Sewage Treatment Plants and related Sewage Systems to treat Waster Water falling into Korang River and Rawal Lake for Rs6.076bn.
The establishment of a Danish School at Jia Kham Sohbatpur worth Rs1.61bn was approved by the CDWP. The Government of Balochistan is the sponsoring agency of the project.
In January this year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during the inauguration ceremony of the model school at Jia Khan directed to establish Danish Schools at Jia Khan Sohbatpur district and 12 other districts of Balochistan.

6,World food prices rise for first time in a year: FAO,"FAO says the April rise reflected higher prices for sugar, meat and rice.","ROME: The United Nations food agency’s world price index rose in April for the first time in a year but is still some 20 per cent up on a record high hit in March 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  
The Food and Agri­cul­ture Organisation’s (FAO) price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, avera­ged 127.2 points last month against 126.5 for March, the agency said on Friday. The March reading was originally given as 126.9.
The Rome-based agency said the April rise reflected higher prices for sugar, meat and rice, which offset declines in the cereals, dairy and vegetable oil price indices.
“As economies recover from significant slowdowns, demand will increase, exerting upward pressure on food prices,” said FAO Chief Economist Maximo Torero.
The sugar price index surged 17.6pc from March, hitting its highest level since October 2011. FAO said the rise was linked to concerns of tighter supplies following downward revisions to production forecasts for India and China, along with lower-than-earlier-expected outputs in Thailand and the European Union.
While the meat index rose 1.3pc month-on-month, dairy prices dipped 1.7pc, vegetable oil prices fell 1.3pc and the cereal price index shed 1.7pc, with a decline in world prices of all major grains outweighing an increase in rice prices.
“The increase in rice prices is extremely worrisome and it is essential that the Black Sea initiative is renewed to avoid any other spikes in wheat and maize,” said Torero, referring to a deal to allow the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea.
The FAO forecast world wheat production in 2023 of 785m tonnes, slightly below 2022 levels but nonetheless the second largest outturn on record.

7,"Iranian diesel captures 25pc local market, says S&P","Fuel oil consumption plunges 83pc to just 70,000 tonnes from a year earlier while diesel sales drop 50pc YoY.","

OIL and diesel is being brought on pick-up vehicles and on motorbikes at Pak-Iran border. Between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels of smuggled diesel enter the domestic market through sea and land routes on a daily basis.—Dawn/file

 
KARACHI: The heavy influx of smuggled Iranian oil has captured 25 to 30 per cent of the diesel market in Pakistan depriving the national exchequer of billions of rupees in taxes and duties and forcing the domestic refiners to slash their production.
A detailed report issued by the S&P Global Commodity Insights quoting several officials, analysts and oil producers, said cheaper Iranian diesel has rapidly gained popularity among Pakistani consumers looking for affordable fuels.
A shortage of dollar reserves and faltering Pakistani currency also kept fuel prices high in the country, prompting small private trading companies and individuals with a business network in Iran to purchase heavily discounted diesel, said industry analysts, including Tahir Abbas, head of research at Karachi-based broking firm Arif Habib Ltd.
Pakistan’s inflation rate surged to 36.4 per cent in April, the highest since December 1973.
Gasoline sales in Pakistan fell 24 per cent from a year earlier to 580,000 tonnes in April, while diesel sales dropped 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to 460,000 tonnes and fuel oil consumption plunged 83 per cent to just 70,000 tonnes during the period, the latest data from Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) and oil marketing companies showed.
Industrial, transportation and agricultural activities have slowed as inflation rates surged. Gasoline sales during the first 10 months of the fiscal year fell 17pc to 6.173 million tonnes, while diesel sales tumbled 28 per cent YoY to 6.173m tonnes, OCAC data showed.
According to the report domestic refiners in Pakistan are facing tepid consumer demand because of a sharp slowdown in economic activity, with the country’s oil product sales in April tumbling 46 per cent YoY to 1.17m tonnes, or about 8.8m barrels, according to OCAC.
The widespread availability of Iranian diesel, especially in the southern region of the country, is hurting refiners’ diesel sales due to a significant price spread between Pakistani and Iranian barrels, said Insight Securities, a Karachi-based broking firm.
The average retail price of diesel has been Rs288 per litre in recent weeks in Pakistan, while Iranian diesel has been selling as low as Rs230/litre.
According to market observers, private dealers have been able to make decent profits by selling Iranian diesel at a price that is Rs35/litre cheaper than local diesel.
However, between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day of diesel could have flowed into the domestic market through southern sea and land transportation routes under the radar in recent months and it’s possible that the volumes could rise, according to estimates from a senior executive at Attock Refinery and a middle distillate distribution management source at Pak Arab Refinery, or PARCO, who declined to be identified.
Pakistan officially banned imports of Iranian oil after the US enforced sanctions on Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical trade in 2013.
“Infiltration of Iranian diesel is growing and it could substitute as much as 25pc to 30 per cent of Pakistan’s total diesel sales,” a private dealer told S&P Global.
The influx of Iranian diesel has also led to revenue losses in billions of rupees for the government, refining industry participants said.
