0,Rupee hits 10-week high against US dollar,"Reaches nearly Rs281.50/$, marking 3rd consecutive day of gains","The Pakistani rupee strengthened to almost Rs281.50 against the US dollar, achieving a 10-week high in the interbank market on Friday. The uptrend continued for the third consecutive working day, with a notable boost in foreign currency inflows contributing to the positive momentum.
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data revealed a 0.10% increase, equivalent to Rs0.27, bringing the closing rate to Rs281.40 against the greenback. Over the past five weeks, the currency has seen a cumulative surge of 1.50%, or Rs4.24, providing relief against imported inflation.
Read Rupee continues upward trajectory
In the open market, the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported a 0.06% rebound, with the currency closing at Rs282.36/$. This positive trajectory followed reports of official inflows totalling $464 million, leading to a rise in the country’s foreign exchange reserves held by the SBP to a five-and-a-half-month high of $8.22 billion.
Multilateral creditors, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank, were cited as sources of the unexpected inflows. The additional funds enhanced Pakistan’s capacity for timely import payments and foreign debt repayments.
The financial markets had anticipated these inflows after the International Monetary Fund executive board’s final approval for a $700 million loan tranche to Pakistan on January 11, 2023. However, the inflows arrived earlier, surprising the markets.
In a separate trend, gold prices continued their downward trajectory, decreasing by 0.55%, or Rs1,200, to reach Rs217,000 per tola (11.66 grams) in Pakistan on Friday. The decline, observed for the third consecutive working day, resulted in a cumulative drop of almost 2%, or Rs4,300 per tola, over the past three days. 
The decrease is attributed to a global downtrend, with gold falling by $9 to $2,058 per ounce (31.10 grams) on Friday, according to the All Pakistan Sarafa Germs and Jewellers Association.

1,Stocks stumble as Senate seeks election delay,"KSE-100 index plummets 124.26 points, settles at 64,514.90","A wave of uncertainty engulfed the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday, triggered by unexpected political shifts. The benchmark KSE-100 index witnessed significant fluctuations, tumbling notably as news of the senate approving a resolution seeking a delay in general elections surfaced.
The first half of the trading session saw a range-bound market, with optimism prevailing as K-Electric signed a 10-year agreement with the government to supply electricity to the national grid. This news propelled the market to an intra-day high at 65,077.48 points.
However, volatility took hold later in the session, leading to a sharp decline in stock prices, and the market hit an intra-day low of 63,757.96 points. The senate’s resolution seeking election delay, citing security concerns, contributed to this downturn.
Despite a midday recovery driven by the rejection of the poll delay attempt by mainstream parties, the market failed to regain positive momentum and closed the week on a negative note.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti attributed the market’s bearish close to political uncertainty and concerns regarding financial losses in State-Owned Entities (SOEs). The senate’s resolution, if implemented, is expected to impact talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and overall political stability.
At the close, the KSE-100 index recorded a marginal decrease of -124.26 points or -0.19%, settling at 64,514.90.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported a continued recovery at the PSX, with a +3.30% gain week-on-week from the previous week’s 60,000 level. The outlook suggests positivity for equities in the coming week, with anticipated support at 63,000 and resistance at 65,000.
The market observed a ratio of 53 advancers to 41 decliners. K-Electric (+8.32%) made a significant positive contribution following the 10-year agreement with the government. Major drags on the index were Fauji Fertiliser (-1.5%), Engro (-1.39%), and Pakistan Services (-5.44%), the ALH report added.
Read Stocks end flat over continuous volatility
JS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi noted that panic selling due to election-related news turned market sentiment negative, resulting in a loss of 124 points for the KSE-100 index.
Despite the overall downturn, selective stocks, including Honda Atlas Cars, Pak Suzuki Motors, and Sazgar Engineering Works, closed with notable gains. Other gainers included Atlas Battery, Exide Pakistan, Searle, and Shell Pakistan.
Topline Securities highlighted that the KSE-100 index traded mostly in the positive zone during the first half of the session but faced pressure in the second half due to the senate’s resolution for election delay. Although some recovery was observed in the eleventh hour as investor’s weighed in the fact that the resolution was passed with thin attendance and is thus non-binding, the index closed at 64,515, down by -0.19%.
Overall trading volumes increased to 949.56 million shares, with a total value of Rs19.4 billion.
Shares of 362 companies were traded. Of these, 161 stocks closed higher, 187 dropped and 14 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with 481.2 million shares trading, gaining Rs0.47 to close at Rs6.12. KE was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 33.4 million shares, losing Rs0.01 to close at Rs1.47 and Bank of Punjab with 28.5 million shares, losing Rs0.07 to close at Rs6.92.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs17.5 million, according to the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL).

2,Rs908b added to public debt in Nov,"Expenditures raise overall debt to Rs63.4tr, with interest payments soaring","The interim government added Rs908 billion to public debt in November alone – the third-highest increase in a single month in this fiscal year, largely due to increased expenditures, pushing its overall debt to Rs63.4 trillion.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Friday that the federal government’s debt increased to Rs63.8 trillion by the end of November 2023. The caretaker government added nearly Rs908 billion to the debt stock in a single month, marking the third-highest increase in debt this fiscal year.
The revised debt numbers for July 2019 showed that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government had included Rs936 billion in its last month in power, Rs29 billion higher than the provisionally reported figures. The highest increase in public debt this fiscal year was Rs2.2 trillion in August, mainly due to a Rs19 per dollar devaluation in that month.
The Rs908 billion increase in public debt was Rs328 billion more than the provisional federal budget deficit booked in November, according to government sources.
A major surge in public debt was on the domestic front. Out of Rs908 billion, an amount of Rs546 billion was added to the domestic debt stock. The increase in external debt in a single month was Rs361 billion, including the impact of rupee devaluation. The rupee-dollar parity by the end of November stood at Rs285.24 per dollar – up by Rs3.72 per dollar from the preceding month.
Public debt has been multiplying at an unsustainable pace due to uncontrolled expenditures, below-potential revenue collection from sectors like real estate, services, and agriculture, and the sinking rupee against the dollar.
The federal government’s expenditure surged to Rs4.83 trillion in five months due to an unmanageable interest cost and a slight opening of the public purse for other spending. Finance ministry sources said that the tight control maintained over expenditures until October was slightly relaxed in November, resulting in about a Rs580 billion jump in the federal budget deficit in just one month.
During the July-November period of this fiscal year, total federal government expenses rose to Rs4.83 trillion, marking an increase of nearly Rs1.5 trillion or 43% compared to the same period last fiscal year.
Interest payments during July-November skyrocketed to Rs2.92 trillion, a 75% increase compared to the same period last fiscal year.
Overall, federal government debt jumped from Rs51 trillion a year ago to Rs63.3 trillion – an increase of Rs12.4 trillion or one-fourth within a year. The SBP bulletin showed that the external debt of the federal government rose at a pace of 25% to Rs22.4 trillion in one year. There was a net increase of Rs4.5 trillion in external debt, largely due to currency depreciation and the revival of foreign lending.
At the end of November 2022, external debt stood at Rs18 trillion, excluding IMF liabilities. Pakistan received major loans from multilateral and bilateral creditors in July. The share of external debt in the total debt is over 35%, and any movement in the exchange rate leaves a major impact without even borrowing a single dollar.
In November 2022, the rupee-dollar parity was at Rs224, which depreciated to Rs285.3, a drop of Rs61, or 27%, in just one year. Such a large and steep depreciation also fuelled inflation in the country. Lately, the rupee is making recoveries on the back of tight control on imports.
Read Govt rejects absorbing PIA’s Rs263b debt
The federal government’s total domestic debt increased to Rs41 trillion, an addition of Rs8 trillion (or 24%) in the past one year.
A direct consequence of the mounting debt is a huge increase in the cost of debt servicing. Debt servicing is expected to stay around Rs8.5 trillion during the current fiscal year – far higher than the government’s budgeted amount.
In a high-interest rate environment, the federal government is heavily borrowing on a long-term basis, revealed the SBP bulletin. The share of long-term debt within one month increased from Rs31.3 trillion to Rs33.2 trillion – a surge of Rs1.9 trillion.
Prudent debt management warrants fewer longer-tenor borrowings when interest rates are at their highest levels and are expected to reduce short-term.
However, the government’s borrowings against short-term instruments have reduced in November compared to the preceding month. In October, the stock of short-term domestic debt was Rs9 trillion, decreasing by 15% to Rs7.6 trillion in November – a reduction of Rs1.4 trillion.
This will significantly increase the cost of the debt burden of the government, as the finance ministry is making attempts to show less debt servicing cost in this fiscal year through longer-term borrowings.
In the budget, the government had set aside Rs7.3 trillion for interest payments despite internal workings showing the cost at around Rs8.3 trillion. The IMF has now projected the interest cost at over Rs8.6 trillion.

3,Oil rises over $1,Maersk announced it will divert all vessels away from Red Sea for foreseeable future,"Oil prices rose over $1 on Friday as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken prepared to visit the Middle East in an attempt to contain flaring regional tensions as the Israel-Hamas conflict rages.
Brent crude futures were up $1.10, or 1.42%, at $78.69 a barrel, while US WTI crude futures rose $1.45, or 2.01%, to $73.64 by 1551 GMT. Both benchmarks are on track to end the first week of the year higher, having almost recouped their losses from Thursday triggered by hefty increases in US gasoline and distillate stocks. The price rebound serves as “a reminder of the risk that is rooted in ever-growing tension in the Middle East,” said PVM analyst Tamas Varga.
Maersk announced it will divert all vessels away from the Red Sea for the foreseeable future. The risk of escalation on Lebanon’s border is “unfortunately very real”, said a German foreign ministry spokesperson on Friday.

4,Delayed import decision led to urea shortage: Solangi,"Farmers say despite imports, country might still face shortfall of 0.6 million tonnes","In response to the ongoing shortage of fertiliser in Pakistan, Minister for Information, Broadcasting, and Parliamentary Affairs, Murtaza Solangi, highlighted that the delay in the cabinet’s decision to import fertiliser contributed to the current scarcity. He informed the Senate on Friday that the government has recently imported around 220,000 tonnes of urea to alleviate the shortage and stabilise prices.
Solangi assured the Senate members that the imported urea would help reduce the scarcity and impact the commodity’s pricing positively. He underscored the availability of ample stock in the country to meet local demands. However, farmer lobbies suggest that despite fresh imports, the country might still face a shortfall of 0.6 million tonnes, as the domestic urea production in 2023 reached only 6.4 million tonnes against an annual demand of 7 million tonnes.
The minister shared projections for the Rabi season, indicating that urea supply was estimated to be 3.5 million tonnes, with an initial balance of 770,000 tonnes and local production of 3.28 million tonnes. He acknowledged challenges, including the closure of two urea fertiliser plants and reduced gas availability for Fauji Fertiliser, contributing to a shortfall of 1.8 million tonnes in urea production.

Urea shortages in Pakistan have become routine, leading to increased prices and difficulties for farmers. Middlemen are blamed for creating artificial shortages, charging farmers above prescribed maximum retail prices. Farmers demand that urea prices remain reasonable, not exceeding Rs3000 per bag, to make farming economically viable.
Solangi acknowledged the artificial scarcity and accused hoarders and speculators of attempting to create shortages. Governments at federal and provincial levels are taking action against such culprits, with fines imposed on hoarders. Despite these measures and recent urea imports, the minister acknowledged the need for additional imports to stabilise prices and ensure uniform pricing nationwide.
While Solangi stated that urea is currently available at Rs4,451 per bag, farmers argue that Rs3000 per bag is a reasonable price for sustainable farming. They advocate for additional imports as a buffer stock to stabilise prices and deter middlemen from exploiting price differentials, ensuring food security in Pakistan.

5,SMAP calls for action on Red Sea disruptions,Chairman suggests reactivating PNSC vessels to benefit region,"Salt Manufacturers Association of Pakistan (SMAP), Acting Chairman, Qasim Yaqoob Paracha has appealed to the government to take swift action in resolving disruptions to international trade in the Red Sea. Recent attacks on vessels have led to shipping firms overcharging exporters, posing a threat to the viability of the salt sector and other crucial industries.
Paracha highlighted the need for the government to pursue international solutions promptly. Speaking to The Express Tribune, Parachi suggested that if the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) resumes vessel services under Pakistan’s flagship, it will not only benefit Pakistan but also positively impact other Muslim countries in the region. The PNSC operates internationally on a commercially-market basis with competitive rates.
Additionally, Paracha proposed exploring public-private partnerships, leveraging the expertise of experienced mentors in Pakistan’s shipping lines. He also recommended establishing mechanisms for exports by road and rail, aligning with the practices of many European countries.

In discussions with officials from the PNSC about recent security concerns in the Red Sea, Paracha quoted PNSC Director Khurrum Mirza as expressing eagerness for collaboration. He believes that synergies between SMAP and PNSC can lead to innovative solutions.
Given that salt is a low-priced commodity, Paracha stated that salt exporters cannot afford the overcharges imposed by shipping companies. The urgency of addressing disruptions in the Red Sea is crucial for the stability of international trade and the sustainability of vital industries.

6,PSX prepares for first IPO of 2024,Secure Logistics Group plans to sell 63 million shares to raise financing of Rs750 million,"The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is poised to welcome the first new company to its trading platform in the New Year 2024 after emerging as the world’s best-performing stock market in the second half (Jul-Dec) of 2023.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Shahid Ali Habib, Chief Executive Officer of Arif Habib Limited (AHL), stated that Secure Logistics Group (SLG) in Pakistan is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) in the first quarter of 2024. The company aims to sell 63 million shares to institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, and retail investors, with the goal of raising a minimum financing of Rs750 million on the PSX.
The funds raised from the IPO will be utilised for debt repayment, the addition of 25 distribution vehicles, upgrading IT infrastructure, and establishing a warehouse in the vicinity of Lahore, said Habib.
AHL is the exclusive financial adviser and book-runner for the IPO.
The last IPO at PSX took place about five months ago when Symmetry Group went public in early August 2023. It was the sole IPO held in the entire preceding year, marked by heightened political and economic crises.
SLG, headquartered in Islamabad, specialises in providing logistics and vehicle fleet management services in Pakistan. Following the IPO, SLG will become the first logistics-listed company in the country, he said.
Currently managing a fleet of 283 vehicles, SLG’s revenue is projected to increase to Rs2.1 billion in 2023, with an anticipated 28% growth in 2024, said the AHL CEO.
Earlier plans for an IPO in 2022, with a target of raising Rs1.5 billion, were temporarily shelved due to political and economic uncertainties that could impact the accurate pricing of stocks through a Dutch auction.
SLG has re-entered the market for the IPO following PSX’s impressive 55% growth in 2023, particularly in the second half, ending the year at a new high level of 62,451 points on December 29.
Read PSX gets off to flying start in 2024
Additionally, signs of economic recovery have been observed since July 2023, according to the State Bank of Pakistan. Research analysts project the market to reach new highs, ranging between 75,000 and 81,000 points by the end of December 2024, considering that share prices still remain lower than historical levels.
Factors such as the general election in February 2024, a potential acquisition of another IMF bailout package after the completion of the current one in March 2024, and an expected 4-5% cut in the central bank’s key policy rate to 17-18% by the end of June 2024 are predicted to support a turnaround in the domestic economy and maintain an uptrend in the stock market.
Topline Research recently reported that PSX saw only one IPO in 2023, raising a meagre Rs435 million. This amount is the lowest raised in a year in the past decade and a half, compared to the previous record low of Rs800 million in 2013.
The number of IPOs at PSX has remained at a single IPO per year since 2019, a stark contrast to the previous 5-year and 10-year averages of four IPOs per year. Analysts attribute this trend to macro-economic instability, the looming threat of default, cheap valuations, and political uncertainty, all of which discourage equity investment.
The lone IPO in 2023 was that of Symmetry Group on the main board. As Pakistan’s first publicly listed digital technology company, Symmetry Group focuses on the digitalisation of consumer-centric functions of organizations. The company offered 101.24 million shares at a strike price of Rs4.3/share, raising Rs435 million in August 2023, with an oversubscription of 1.58 times.

7,Inflation hits four-week high,"Out of 51 items, prices of 19 increase, 9 decrease, and 23 remain unchanged during week","Pakistan’s weekly inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator, rose by a four-week high rate of 0.81% in the week ending Jan 4, 2024, according to the PBS. The stubborn inflation is primarily attributed to a surge in food prices during the week, significantly impacting economic growth.
YoY, the inflation rate recorded a staggering increase of 42.86%, with a substantial rise (of 1,180.58%) in pipelined gas prices being the primary driver. Out of 51 items, prices of 19 increased, 9 decreased, and 23 remained unchanged during the week. Tomatoes experienced a notable surge of 16.04%, followed by a 13.98% increase in chicken prices.
Read Stocks slip over high inflation reading
Despite efforts, Pakistan has struggled to curb inflation, partly due to rising commodity prices in global markets, affecting its imports. The benchmark monthly inflation spiked by 29.7% in Dec 2023, surpassing the government’s projection of 27.5-28.5%, driven by increases in power prices and the housing index. Monthly inflation in the first half of FY24 hovered around 30%, exceeding the SBP’s initial forecast of 20-22% for the full year. The government’s decision to raise gas tariffs by up to 193% in Nov 2023 also contributed to inflationary pressure.

The joint venture announcement is expected next week.
Caretaker Minister for IT and Telecom, Dr Umar Saif, stated that PayPal will operate indirectly in Pakistan through this collaboration, marking a significant development for the country’s growing freelance community (approximately 1.5 million), the fourth-largest globally.
The move comes after persistent efforts by previous governments to convince PayPal to operate in Pakistan, which faced resistance citing security concerns.
Saif highlighted the positive impact on IT exports and freelancer remittances, attributing the uptick to recent measures supporting a liberal financial regime.

He added that the inflows from IT export have already jumped by 13% for November and will continue to grow. The IT Ministry has undertaken various initiatives, including providing smartphones through instalment plans, standardised quality tests for IT graduates, and approval of the National Space Policy. Saif expressed confidence in launching 5G services in Pakistan by July 2024, with a spectrum auction offering 300 MHz.
The government aims to boost IT exports from $2.6 billion to approximately $5 billion by facilitating a more liberal financial regime. As part of this effort, IT companies can now keep 50% of their export revenue in dollars in a local account, easing international payments.
Additionally, the government plans to launch 10,000 e-Rozgar Centres across the country, providing facilities for freelancers and start-ups. The National Space Policy has been approved to enable companies to use low-orbit satellites for communication services.

9,Govt-KE ink key energy security pact,Agreement addresses legacy issues that are pivotal for Karachi’s long-term energy sustainability,"In a significant development, the Government of Pakistan (GoP) and K-Electric (KE) have formally signed crucial agreements aimed at securing the energy needs of Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city. The agreements solidify the provision of power from the National Grid to Karachi, ensuring a reliable energy supply up to the interconnection capacity.
The signing ceremony, held at the Power Division office, was attended by Muhammad Ali, Minister of Energy, Power, and Petroleum, and Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Minister of Finance. Representing K-Electric were CEO Moonis Alvi and CFO Muhammad Aamir Ghaziani.
These agreements, subject to extensive deliberations among various stakeholders, address legacy issues that are pivotal for Karachi’s long-term energy sustainability. Among the key agreements signed are the Tariff Differential Subsidy Agreement for a decade, establishing a framework for government subsidies to make electricity more affordable for consumers in specific areas. The Power Purchase Agency Agreement, also valid for ten years, regularises the existing power supply arrangement from the National Grid to KE, ensuring transparent transactions and timely payments.
Additionally, the signing of the Interconnection Agreement is anticipated after approval from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. This agreement ensures a secure energy supply from the National Grid, enhancing access to affordable power for KE customers. The Mediation Agreement is another crucial aspect, facilitating the reconciliation of legacy disputes on payables and receivables between KE and government entities, including Sui Southern Gas Company.

The recent approval of these agreements by the Economic Coordination Committee and subsequent Cabinet ratification, based on recommendations from the prime minister’s taskforce on energy, marked a significant step toward resolving complex issues. The Caretaker Prime Minister, Anwaarul Haq Kakar, assured support from the GoP during a meeting with representatives of Saudi Group Al Jomaih, KE’s oldest and one of the largest shareholders since privatisation.
The agreements, announced by the Special Investment Facilitation Council, signal a positive trajectory for sustainable resolutions in the power sector. The signing not only provides a roadmap for mediation on other pending matters but also promotes stability for both KE and government entities.
Expressing gratitude, KE CEO, Moonis Alvi, expressed the significance of these agreements, considering them a paradigm shift in the energy landscape. He acknowledged the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders, including the prime minister, ministers of energy and finance, the SIFC, and the task force under Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. Alvi highlighted the potential of firm power supply for Karachi in addressing energy challenges and reducing the subsidy burden on the government.
Minister of Energy, Muhammad Ali, described the signing as a step toward bringing efficiency and long-term stability to the power sector. He highlighted the collective commitment of institutions toward enhancing the power sector’s enabling environment for the benefit of customers.
Finance Minister, Shamshad Akhtar, underscored the importance of streamlining issues and resolving legacy matters in the energy sector.
