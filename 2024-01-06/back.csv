1,US supports ‘vibrant’ democracy in Pakistan,State Dept spokesperson says it is not for Washington to dictate Islamabad polls ‘specifics’,"The United States said on Thursday it would continue to support a “vibrant” democracy in Pakistan but it was not supposed to dictate Islamabad on the “exact specifics” of holding the general elections, which is due in the country next month.
At his regular press briefing in Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller declined to comment on the allegations of “excesses ahead of the polls” levelled by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) against the government.
“We will continue to support democratic expression and a vibrant democracy in Pakistan,” Miller told the journalists. “It’s not for the United States to dictate to Pakistan how it conducts – the exact specifics of how it conducts its election,” he added.
“But to make clear that we want to see those elections conducted in a free, fair, and peaceful manner that includes freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, and ultimately a full, open, reliable, vibrant democratic process,” he said.
“Our interest, as you’ve heard me say before, is in the democratic process. We want to see free and fair elections which are conducted in accordance with Pakistan’s laws, and we don’t support one candidate or party over another in Pakistan or anywhere else in the world.”

2,'Assault on democracy': Political parties alarmed by Senate resolution,"PPP, PTI issue show-cause notices to party lawmakers over 'violations of leadership's directives'","The general elections faced a fresh wave of uncertainty on Friday following a resolution put forth by the Senate, drawing alarms from major political parties about the potential postponement of the polls, terming it 'an assault on democracy' and move 'akin to surrendering to those who want nation's instability'.
The resolution, passed amid full-fledged preparations for the polls, came as an unexpected development, casting a shadow over the previously settled February 8 election date, which had been established following discussions between the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and President Arif Alvi.
The resolution, surprisingly passed with low attendance, injected a sense of unpredictability into the electoral process. Nayyar Bukhari, Secretary General of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), took immediate action in response to the resolution and issued a show-cause notice to Senator Bahramand Khan Tangi, acting upon directives from the party's top leadership.

The notice pertained to Senator Tangi's endorsement of the resolution, including a speech advocating its adoption, drawing scrutiny from the party hierarchy. “It is your knowledge that leadership and the party are of firm opinion that the election be held on the date given by the ECP, thus you supported a resolution which is against the policy and direction of the party leadership,” the notice reads.
It said Tangi violated the party leadership’s direction and policies. The senator was asked to file a reply within a week as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. Similarly, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) also stepped into action and issued a show-cause notice to Senator Gurdeep Singh.
Directed by Central Secretary General Umar Ayub Khan, the notice sought clarification from Senator Singh regarding his involvement in the approval process of the resolution advocating the postponement of elections. Senator Singh, who participated in the House proceedings, has been given three days to give explanations regarding his actions.
“It has come to the notice of the party Leadership that you were sitting in the Senate session where the resolution was moved and passed to delay the General Elections scheduled in February 2024. You did not point out the quorum or oppose the said resolution,” the notice read.

Therefore, the notice said, the senator has violated the party's known and stated position of holding free and fair elections on Feb 8. “If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules.”
‘Assault on constitution, democracy’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan also vehemently criticised the Senate's resolution to delay the general elections, denouncing it as an assault on constitutional principles and democracy.
In a statement released by PTI's central media, Barrister Gohar Khan reiterated the party's strong condemnation of the upper house's endorsement of the resolution aimed at postponing the elections beyond the scheduled date of February 8.
He labelled this move by certain political entities as an assault on the foundation of the constitution and democratic values. Expressing concern, the PTI chief highlighted the violation of the Senate's sanctity by those attempting to push back the general elections through an unconstitutional resolution.
He emphasised the constitutional obligation of the ECP of Pakistan and the caretaker government to conduct transparent elections within the constitutionally mandated 90-day period. “Approving such an unconstitutional decision,” he argued.

Gohar asserted his party's preparedness for the upcoming elections, rejecting any dubious attempts aimed at delaying them. He urged the SC to promptly take notice of the Senate's resolution and take effective measures to counter any efforts hindering the electoral process's transparency or timing.
‘PPP did not endorse the resolution’
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Peoples Party made its stance clear, stating that it did not endorse the Senate's resolution proposing a delay in the elections. Addressing a press conference held at Bilawal House, PPP's senior leader Sherry Rehman emphasised the party's position, affirming its commitment to timely, fair, and transparent elections.
""Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has unequivocally expressed our stance: we advocate for elections held as scheduled. The PPP is consistent in seeking timely elections,"" she asserted.
She underscored that the Supreme Court has decided February 8 as the election date, and all necessary preparations, including finalising candidates, have been concluded accordingly.
Regarding the resolution proposing a postponement, the senior leader highlighted its presentation with only 14 senators present, failing to meet the quorum requirement.
She noted Senator Tangi's opposition to the resolution, adding that if any ambiguity persisted, the party would seek clarification from him.
PML-N Central Information Secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb also clarified the party's commitment to conducting the general elections on February 8, 2024. She emphasised that in line with the ECP’s schedule, comprehensive preparations for the elections are currently underway.

""On February 8, the people will exercise their democratic right to vote, contributing to Pakistan's development, peace, and prosperity,"" she stated.
‘Polls delay akin to surrendering’
Jamaat-e-Islami emir Sirajul Haq said that advocating for the postponement of elections within the Senate constitutes “a conspiracy against both the nation and democratic principles”.
He expressed concerns that delaying elections due to unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) would essentially amount to capitulating to those instigating instability.
He stressed that ensuring peace and stability in the country hinges upon conducting transparent and punctual elections.
Jamaat-e-Islami is firm in its stance, advocating for fair and transparent electionsnationwide on February 8, he said adding that the party has distributed candidacy tickets for the national and provincial assembly positions nationwide.

4,Pakistan reiterates support for IIOJK people,PM says India continues to oppress people of Jammu and Kashmir to break their will,"Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Friday reiterated that Pakistan would continue to extend its full political, diplomatic, and moral support to the valiant Kashmiri people in their just struggle for their rights, including the inalienable right to self-determination, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
“Today, Kashmiris around the world are observing the 75th anniversary of the Resolution adopted by the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), providing that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute will be decided through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite under the UN auspices, the prime minister said in a message on the occasion of Self-Determination Day.
In essence, he said it was a reaffirmation of the inalienable right of Kashmiris to self-determination, which is enshrined in international law and upheld by international human rights instruments. He regretted that despite more than seven-and-a-half decades, the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) had not been able to exercise this fundamental right. “India continues to oppress the people of Jammu and Kashmir to break their will.”
Read Lawyers seek to challenge Indian SC’s IIOJK verdict
Since August 5, 2019, the prime minister said India was engaged in a vicious exercise, aimed at altering the demographic structure and political landscape of IIOJK, to turn Kashmiris into a disempowered community in their land. The Indian Supreme Court’s recent verdict on the status of IIOJK was yet another step towards the denial of the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination.
“The genuine aspirations of the Kashmiris cannot be wished away through domestic legislation and engineered judicial verdicts,” he added. He pointed out the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) annually adopts a resolution on ‘Universal Realisation of the Right of the People to Self-Determination’ that draws international attention towards the plight and rights of people living under situations of forced occupation.
“The international community, especially the United Nations, is responsible for ensuring that the people of IIOJK exercise their inalienable right to self-determination,” he added. Separately, Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Human Rights Mushaal Hussein Mullick urged the international community to take practical steps to hold India accountable for its gross and widespread human rights violations in IIOJK.

Addressing a seminar in connection with Right to Self-Determination Day, she also called upon India to allow unfettered access to the international observers and human rights organisations to IIOJK. The special assistant urged all segments of the society, including academia, Ulema, and journalists, to raise their voice in highlighting the plight of innocent Kashmiris under Indian aggression.
She said, “It is high time that we all should stand up to expose Indian oppression in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.” Condemning Modi's brunt persecution of minorities, particularly Muslims, in India, she said it seemed Modi's government was working on RSS policy to sabotage the rights of minorities and imposed Hindutva in the so-called democratic and secular country.

“Show whether the land is on record or not. It should be stated in which year the land was purchased and when the transfer took place. The documents show that the government approved the plan. No contract was awarded to any contractor personally.
