Furthermore, the petitioner points out a discrepancy in Maryam Nawaz’s nomination papers, where she mentioned dependents in 2023 but omitted her children in the 2024 affidavit.

Punjab Minister for Primary and Secondary Healthcare Dr Jamal Nasir unveiled the initiative during a press conference on Friday. The crackdown will involve dedicated teams, comprising staff from the Punjab Healthcare Commission and the Drug Control Directorate of the Primary and Secondary Healthcare department.
These specialised teams will target hazardous cosmetics, assessing their registration status, and scrutinise practitioners administering beauty injections or operating aesthetic clinics for various surgeries.
The Drug Control Directorate will focus on the verification of registration for beauty creams and cosmetics, while the Healthcare Commission professionals will review clinical practices at these establishments.

Dr Nasir expressed concern over the escalating use of hazardous cosmetics in Pakistan, particularly sub-standard fairness creams, which he attributed to causing skin diseases under the guise of enhancing beauty.
The minister highlighted that unregistered beauty creams have inflicted irrecoverable damage to the skin of numerous users. Some cosmetics have been found to contain elevated levels of mercury, lead, poisons, and other harmful chemicals, which could potentially lead to life-threatening diseases such as liver or kidney cancer, the minister warned.
To address this, beauty creams from 24 prominent brands are undergoing rigorous examination at the Drug Testing Laboratory in Lahore. Strict actions will be taken if any of these are found to contain harmful chemicals.

From January 1 to December 31, 2023, the six police stations in Chichawatni Circle—Saddar, City, Kassowal, Ghaziabad, Shahkot, and Okanwala Bangla—logged a total of 5,633 reported crimes.
Among them, 276 cases were dismissed as fraudulent or pointless, while 894 incomplete challans were submitted to area magistrates during the stipulated period.

The authorities have arrested and imprisoned 4,682 accused, actively pursuing the remaining 5,093 still at large. Within Circle Chichawatni, major crimes, including murder, robbery, and drug-related offenses, accounted for 1,158 cases.

Despite achieving a 70% challan rate for compiling cases on time, the overall case registration rate in the police stations is 60% higher, reflecting a 19% decrease compared to 2022.
The population surge in the region has strained police resources, leading to challenges in personnel and transportation.
While acknowledging the improvements in police performance, concerns linger over the unresolved cases, notably the assassination of businessman Yusuf Jamal Tikka and the disappearance of six-year-old Adiba.
The ethical conduct of a few officers, violating human rights and acting outside the law, has tarnished the reputation of the police department.
As the Punjab government strives to reform the ""police culture,"" questions persist in public and social circles about the actual impact on police performance and the escalating crime rate, prompting a critical evaluation of the annual figures released by the Circle Police.
