0,Committee to identify 'masterminds' of May 9,Caretaker govt forms five-member panel under directions of PM Kakar,"The Cabinet Division, under the direction of caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, on Saturday established a five-member committee to investigate the events of May 9, 2023.
The committee aims to pinpoint individuals responsible in the role of the ""mastermind, planners, facilitators and executors"" behind the nationwide upheaval following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan on May 9 last year.
The PTI has suffered a significant loss of its key political figures in the aftermath of the violent events, rendering the party a mere shell of its former self.
The situation has triggered a massive crackdown and an exodus of leaders from the party while Imran remains incarcerated.
Comprising key representatives, including the ministers for law and justice, interior, information and broadcasting, human rights, and potentially co-opted members, the committee is tasked with assessing the situation and proposing measures to prevent such occurrences in the future.
According to notification issued by the Cabinet Secretariat, the minister for law and justice will be the convener of the committee while the members include ministers for interior, information and broadcasting, human rights and any co-opted member to address any issue emanating during the proceedings of the committee.
Outlined in the notification, the committee's terms of references involve a comprehensive review of the May 9 incidents to pinpoint the responsible parties.
This includes analysing the underlying causes, determining accountability, and understanding both the immediate and long-term consequences.
The other ToRs include evaluating their immediate and long-term implications; suggesting preventive measures to ensure that such a breach of national security is not repeated and recommend measures to strengthen the existing legal regime to deter such recurrences.

The Ministry of Interior will provide secretarial support to the committee. The committee shall submit its report for consideration of the cabinet within a period of 14 days.
Moreover, the committee has been directed to present recommendations aimed at preventing any breaches of national security similar to those witnessed on May 9.
Strengthening the existing legal framework to discourage such incidents in the future is also a crucial aspect within the committee's purview.
The Ministry of Interior has been tasked with providing secretarial support to ensure the smooth functioning of the committee. A deadline of 14 days has been set for the committee to submit its report to the cabinet for consideration.
On May 9, 2023, PTI founder Imran Khan was apprehended by the National Accountability Bureau in collaboration with the paramilitary Rangers at the Islamabad High Court in the Al Qadir Trust case.
The development triggered widespread protests across the nation, accompanied by instances of destruction and unrest.
Following the events, the military termed the occurrences of May 9 as a ""dark chapter"", declaring its intention to prosecute the individuals who were involved in the riots under pertinent laws, including both the Pakistan Army Act and the Official Secrets Act.
This decision received backing from the National Security Committee, the primary decision-making body concerning foreign policy and national security in the country.
However, it faced opposition from various human rights organisations and activists.
Later, several people, among them PTI supporters, faced trials in military courts. Besides, various leaders tendered their resignations from the PTI, citing their disapproval of the violence during Imran's arrest and the subsequent assaults on military establishments.
