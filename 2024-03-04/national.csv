0,Analysing WTO conference,"New govt must recalibrate trade policies, actively engage with global community","Amid heightened geopolitical tensions and elections spanning 64 nations, coupled with escalating discontent regarding trade matters, expectations for significant breakthroughs at the recently concluded 13th WTO ministerial meeting in Abu Dhabi were modest.
Nonetheless, with 164 members convening at the highest level to evaluate the functioning of the global trading framework and chart its future course, concerted efforts were made to make headway on numerous trade issues.
These included reviving the WTO Appellate Body, strengthening the fisheries subsidies agreement, state policies on food procurement (public stockholding) and renewing the multilateral moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions.
Despite round-the-clock negotiations and extending the conference duration several times, except for extending the moratorium on electronic transmissions, success eluded on all these issues, as this required the consent of all WTO members.
However, in some areas where negotiations were conducted by groups of countries in a plurilateral setting, significant breakthroughs emerged. These include a new agreement on domestic regulations in services, where 72 nations, encompassing over 92% of the world’s trade in services, reached a deal.
These regulations aim to alleviate procedural impediments enterprises encounter, yielding a worldwide cost reduction of $125 billion. Considering services’ pivotal role in driving commercial growth and marking the first significant outcome in services trade in over a quarter-century, this achievement is a notable milestone.
Another significant accord that was concluded earlier in July 2023 but finalised in the Abu Dhabi ministerial conference by 123 WTO members is the “Agreement on Investment Facilitation for Development” (IFD).

Since many earlier efforts in different settings, including in OECD, had failed, this is hailed as another major success. The agreement is expected to facilitate the flow of foreign direct investment among WTO members, especially for developing countries.
As it also incorporates special and differential treatment provisions, including technical assistance and capacity-building support, it received overwhelming support from developing countries, which account for two-thirds of signatories.
It is estimated that the IFD could generate global welfare gains of $295 to $1,041 billion with most gains accruing to low- and middle-income countries.
Since the failure of the Doha round, plurilateral agreements have shifted from being exceptions to becoming the norm. Unlike multilateral WTO agreements, plurilateral are voluntary and only binding on members that choose to ratify them.
They are typically negotiated through Joint Statement Initiatives (JSIs). Key plurilateral initiatives currently being negotiated include on issues such as digital trade, e-commerce, environmental sustainability, fossil fuel subsidies’ trade relevance, MSMEs (micro, small and medium-sized enterprises), and women in trade.
Unfortunately, Pakistan is not active in any of these plurilateral negotiations as its membership is optional. In fact, it has not yet become a member of the WTO’s most successful plurilateral Agreement on Information Technology (ITA), which now accounts for over 97% of world trade in information technology products, estimated at $1.7 trillion or more than the total trade in automobiles and pharmaceuticals.
Many studies show that in the participating developing countries, productivity has increased several folds due to the lowering of the cost of communication networks and IT equipment.
When Mian Nawaz Sharif was the prime minister, in 2017 he approved the recommendations of a high-level committee that Pakistan should join the ITA. However, before the summary could be submitted for cabinet’s approval, he was removed from office and since then no further action has been taken.
The new government must urgently recalibrate its trade policies and actively engage with the global community across various platforms. Participation in multilateral and plurilateral negotiations at the WTO is imperative, alongside reinvigorated involvement within regional frameworks such as Safta and RCEP.
Simultaneously, unilateral trade liberalisation is warranted to bridge the substantial gap that has emerged with other competing developing countries. Over the past 15 years, Pakistan has entrenched itself as one of the most protectionist nations and is now grouped with Myanmar and Zimbabwe for its inward-looking policies.
Without sweeping reforms, Pakistan’s growth rate will continue to remain below par, export growth will remain stagnant and reliance on loans will increase further.

1,Agri-revolution via China’s expertise,"Collaboration, innovation crucial for Pakistan’s agricultural advancement","China’s agricultural modernisation has been remarkable, ensuring food security for its billion-plus population. Pakistan can leverage Chinese expertise to revitalise its agricultural sector, a cornerstone of its economy.
In Pakistan-China collaboration, both countries benefit from diverse environmental conditions conducive to crop cultivation and livestock rearing.
“Effective management of postharvest losses and enhancing the value of fruits and vegetables through research and development (R&D) collaboration with China is crucial. With Pakistan producing 20 types of fruits and 40 types of vegetables, the high postharvest losses of about 40% in the supply chain result in significant waste, limiting consumer access,” said Prof Dr Zahir Ahmed Zahir, from the University of Agriculture Faisalabad’s Institute of Soil and Environmental Sciences, also serving as President of the Soil Science Society of Pakistan (SSSP).
“Currently, Pakistan’s export of fruits and vegetables stands at $600 million, a figure that could potentially reach $2 billion by improving postharvest practices, reducing losses, and fostering value-added products and industries,” he said.
China’s staple food is rice, while Pakistan relies heavily on wheat. China made rice yield scaling a priority. In 1964, Chinese Scientist Dr Yuan Longping, recognised as the father of hybrid rice, dedicated himself to this task, achieving success in 1972 with the development of a high-yield hybrid rice variety, increasing yield by 20%.
Presently, China boasts hundreds of hybrid varieties, effectively meeting local demand and bolstering food security.
“We are harnessing China’s hybrid varieties as well. In Sindh, we cultivate rice on two million acres, with half of this land dedicated to hybrid varieties imported from China,” said Dr Nihaluddin Marri, Agriculture Research Sindh Director Technical-I.
“To ensure food security, we must focus on three key areas: enhancing high-yield hybrid wheat, optimising storage systems, and managing population growth to halt the conversion of agricultural land into housing schemes. With a rising population and diminishing agricultural land due to expanding housing societies across the country, these measures are imperative,” he added.
Professor Zhou Chang Ming from Xinjiang Agriculture University in China highlighted the current robust state of China’s agricultural production. As the world’s leading producer of wheat, rice, and corn, China also cultivates significant quantities of soybean, cotton, sugar, and other agricultural products. This abundance not only sustains domestic needs but also fuels international markets.
The agricultural landscape in China is evolving, transitioning from a focus solely on food cultivation to a diversified portfolio including vegetables, fruits, livestock, and poultry farming. This diversification enhances resilience within the agricultural sector, mitigating risks associated with reliance on a single industry.

“China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for Agricultural and Rural Modernisation aims to advance rural farming practices, thereby boosting the income growth of rural residents. With significant investments in agricultural research, development, innovation, and mechanisation, China has significantly enhanced the quality and profitability of its agriculture sector. Serving as a model for other developing nations, China’s agricultural modernisation efforts offer invaluable lessons. Notably, the China Maps centres by Syngenta exemplify innovation in the sector, providing comprehensive solutions for farming needs and leading to unprecedented yield improvements,” highlighted Zeeshan Baig, General Manager of Syngenta Pakistan, an esteemed figure in agricultural technology.
Pakistan stands to gain significantly from China’s agricultural modernisation on multiple fronts. Firstly, by enhancing cooperation with China through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan can access opportunities for infrastructure development, trade facilitation, and technology transfer within the agricultural sector.
Secondly, drawing insights from China’s successful agricultural policies, planning, and management practices can aid Pakistan in overhauling its agricultural productivity, efficiency, and sustainability.
Thirdly, by tapping into China’s vast market potential and demand for agricultural products, particularly high-value and niche items like fruits and vegetables, Pakistan can bolster its export revenue.
Lastly, Pakistan can leverage China’s support and assistance to address various challenges confronting its agriculture sector, including climate change, water scarcity, pests and diseases, and food safety concerns.
Utilising state-of-the-art machinery and cutting-edge components can produce high-quality seeds and breeds developed through biotechnology, genetic engineering, and hybridisation. These advancements result in crops with higher yields, increased resistance, and enhanced adaptability. Embracing digital agriculture, including satellite imaging and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, offers valuable data for improved decision-making, pest management, and soil and water crop management.
Additionally, prioritising research and development in biotechnology can lead to the creation of high-yielding and climate-resilient crop varieties tailored to Pakistan’s unique agro-climatic conditions. Smart and precision agriculture utilise big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), IoT, drones, sensors, and satellites to monitor and optimise agricultural production and management.
Meanwhile, modern agricultural machinery and equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, planters, sprayers, irrigation systems, and storage facilities, enhance the mechanisation and automation of agricultural operations.
“China has placed a significant emphasis on value addition, concurrently reducing losses to a mere 2%, by enhancing the production, packing, and marketing of value-added products domestically and internationally. It is imperative for us to adopt and adapt to Chinese technologies in this regard. Currently, we suffer from substantial losses, particularly in horticulture, with approximately 40% of food and vegetables going to waste. Moreover, China’s proactive promotion of sustainable agriculture practices, including organic farming and conservation efforts, underscores its commitment to addressing environmental concerns and ensuring long-term sustainability. The journey of China’s agricultural modernisation exemplifies its dedication to transforming its agrarian economy into a technologically advanced and sustainable sector capable of navigating future challenges,” remarked Prof Dr Muhammad Ismail Kumbhar, a renowned Researcher and Sustainable Development Expert from the Department of Agricultural Education Extension at Sindh Agriculture University (SAU).
Key areas to address to reduce postharvest losses and enhance value addition in fruits and vegetables include:
1. Capacity building in postharvest technology and value addition through collaboration with Chinese experts.
2. Introduction and technology transfer of modern tools, equipment, and machinery for harvest, postharvest management, and packaging of fruits and vegetables.
3. Development of value-added products and processing technology for fruits and vegetables.
4. Exchange of promising cultivars of fruits and vegetable crops to improve yield and quality.
5. Automation of nursery technology for horticultural crops through collaboration with Chinese R&D counterparts.
6. Implementation of quality seed production and processing technology, especially for hybrid seeds.
7. Establishment of food processing zones near CPEC to enhance value-added products, thus stimulating economic growth through agricultural export-led strategies.
China’s expertise can play a crucial role in capacitating Pakistani experts and attracting investors to these processing zones, fostering collaboration and innovation in the agricultural sector.

2,New provincial govts and decentralisation,"Political parties have equal opportunity to decentralise, initiate local govt system in provinces","The Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) assemblies have become operative after a hiatus of 13 months. Similarly, the National Assembly has become functional after a pause of seven months where a coalition government will assume office.
All mainstream political parties have become successful in forming governments in their respective provinces. The people of Pakistan should welcome these developments.
Alongside this, many political parties are raising hue and cry and questioning the outcome of elections. Either they have been wiped out of their respective assemblies or secured less-than-expected seats.
Their political leaders are heading rallies and staging protests at different important locations, pressing for their rights. However, some losing candidates have initiated a legal battle, which may give a tough time to their opponents.
Political commentators and analysts highlight that the mandate is split among political parties so we cannot expect a stable government in the centre.
Apart from Balochistan, all provincial governments should remain stable as each political party has got a simple majority in its respective province. Now, it depends on the political government how does it perform in its respective province as each government has got an opportunity to show its performance in the next five years.
Keeping in view the tight economic situation, political governments will soon come under pressure. The growing sensationalism through social media will create challenges for them.
Political governments of all provinces have been managing their respective provinces in the last decade. If a government rules the province for a decade, it will create regimentation, which restricts benefits to a handful of people.
Political governments would like to run their provinces in a centralised manner. They will depend on their loyalists in the bureaucracy to run the departments and government-owned companies.
Similarly, cabinet members are selected based on their experience in coordinating with their hand-picked bureaucrats. This combination of ministers and bureaucrats concentrate the benefits among them.
Hence, a small chunk of political representatives and bureaucrats becomes beneficiaries while a large chunk flusters. Social and electronic media have played a significant role in raising the expectations of the youth. The young people like to listen and follow their beloved political leaders. They are not ready to tolerate the views of their opponents.
Read: ‘Serious challenges await new government’
This kind of attitude accentuates polarisation in society. Considering the growing aspirations of the youth, political governments are unable to pacify them.
Taking stock of the situation, there is a need to decentralise the affairs of the government. All political parties have an equal opportunity to decentralise and initiate a local government system in their respective provinces.
Any provincial government can take some time in designing the local government system. In the first phase, the new system could be initiated in a few districts. Then it can be expanded to other districts in the second phase.
The provincial government should try to give operational and financial independence to the local government.
There has been a growing informality of businesses in cities. These businesses such as fruit vendors, food and vegetable peddlers, chips and burgers’ kiosks, etc provide livelihood opportunities to scores of people.
Such kinds of businesses should be registered, supported and facilitated so that they can survive and grow. This can be done by energising the local business facilitation centres through the functional local governments.
In a nutshell, the current centralised provincial administration cannot solve the complex problems faced by a large chunk of people. A remote and unaccountable bureaucracy can design and implement policies which can be beneficial for a small class but these will be costly for the rest.
Let us see which provincial government takes the lead in crafting the local government system, which can address the emerging problems.

3,Alternative Lifestyle Festival: towards sustainable future,"As Pakistan is one of worst impacted by climate change, need for sustainable alternatives is imperative","Often, environmental degradation is accepted as a necessary evil if it can ensure economic growth and development. But this caveat can become a compounding catalyst for catastrophe, particularly for countries like Pakistan, which simultaneously struggle with lagging economic growth and environmental instability.
Considering the country’s unsteady economic situation and its position as one of the worst impacted by global climate change, the need for more sustainable alternatives is imperative. And to this end, looking towards options closer to home may have the answers.
As Shaista Ayesha, CEO of the social impact ecosystem development and impact investment organisation SEED Ventures, explained “given the economic challenges, supporting local brands is an alternative to building the economy.”
To this end, under the banner of their sustainability platform, What’s The Alternative (WTA), Ayesha and her team curated and crafted the “Alternative Lifestyle Festival.”
Living up to WTA’s focus on the environment, lifestyle, and wellness, the event took place at Beach Luxury recently, and was open to the public free of cost. It functioned as a community-focused, transformative gathering that offered insight, highlighted sustainable ventures, and created spaces for creativity and learning.
As the latest on the WTA roster, the festival focused on the lifestyle aspect of the platform bringing together locals looking for sustainable alternatives and the industry leaders spearheading those changes.
Like all WTA events, the festival combined insight with enjoyment. To draw attention towards pathbreakers championing alternative methods of production and growth, the festival hosted an insightful panel discussion aptly titled “Choices For Change” where experts from various fields weighed in on the need for alternative approaches to growth.
Andleeb Uroos Ahmed of Philip Morris (Pakistan) Limited noted that the sustainability agenda is integrated within the structure of the business itself, a notion that is perfectly encapsulated by the parent company’s global focus on smoke-free alternatives.
Commenting on the “product transformation” that is taking place within the firm, Uroos emphasised, “we are moving towards less harmful alternatives.”

Simultaneously, she noted that the company is keenly aware of its footprint and has championed campaigns aimed at reducing littering and encouraging recycling among others.
It was encouraging to see leaders from industries that are not always at the forefront of sustainability initiatives because it suggested a shifting of trends.
Sadia Dada, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at K-Electric, acknowledged as much, saying “I know that the power sector is really the last place where this conversation takes place.”
At K-Electric, she emphasised, the shift towards a more sustainable path took into account that the power sector is both necessary and simultaneously one of the most significant contributors to environmental damage. The approach adopted by K-Electric set out a model that produced the energy needed sustainably, while simultaneously offsetting some of the negative byproducts of the energy sector and helped develop a “pathway to progress.”
Sustainable fashion connoisseur Hasan Shehryar Yasin shared the importance of being very selective about what you attach your name to.
Commenting on fashion trends that negatively impact the environment, he noted, “fabric wastage is a problem. And it is going to be a looming problem very quickly because the consumption and hunger for consumption of fashion seems to grow more and more.”
In light of this, he emphasised that “as a responsible citizen not just of Pakistan but a citizen of the world, I must be very clear about where I place my influence.”
As a proponent of craft and tradition, he staunchly stated, “we do not do fast fashion.” Choosing instead to offer his customers a refurbishing service, where they could bring in their HSY pieces and have them revamped.
A leader in the farm-to-table space and co-founder of Karachi Farmer’s Market Sarah Nasiruddin shared her journey of creating a platform for clean producers and the consumers who want to support them.
Reflecting on the ultimate success of the platform, she shared that “people have started noticing changes in their health.” She noted enthusiastically “a lot of their health issues went away.”
Reflecting on the progress made by the Karachi Farmer’s Market, her ultimate takeaway was that “local, seasonal, and clean food” is a must for a sustainable future.
During a fireside chat with environmentalist and horticulture maestro Tofiq Pasha and US-trained child and adult psychiatrist and CEO & Founder of Synapse, Dr Ayesha Mian, delved into mindful eating and lifestyle choices and offered valuable tips on how to make food a meaningful part of one’s life.
A longtime proponent of conscious living and consumption, Tofiq Pasha spoke at length about the importance of mindful living, and preserving the earth. He offered thought-provoking insights into the nuanced art of living consciously, urging attendees to reflect on their daily choices and adopt practices that align with both personal well-being and the natural world.
Reflecting on the collective new normal where alarming rates of mental health disorders alongside health concerns that are on the rise, Dr Ayesha Mian stated that while “Covid has faded” but it has left another kind of “pandemic or endemic” in its wake.
She emphasised that while “all the focus goes on tertiary care when everything has already gone wrong”, “prevention” is something that we all have to look towards championing.
In a bid to champion and celebrate sustainable and healthier alternatives, the event also included a dynamic market brimming with eco-friendly products, organic food and drink options, and sustainable alternatives for fashion, technology, and craft.
Vendors focusing on health and wellness shared space with educational and non-profit organisations. Particular attention was given to sustainability-focused startups.
Wholesome food outlets such as Organi’Kio and The Panjiri delighted the taste buds with hearty, earth-friendly options. Labels like Libas showcased contemporary fashion pieces inspired by traditional craft.
While eclectic brands like Tween The Knots and Dastaan offered home decor pieces that were truly one of a kind, skincare aficionados could also sample organic products from the likes of 100% Wellness Co. While fitness enthusiasts found their haven with booths from the renowned gym TriFit and the esteemed Karachi trainer Mantaha, encouraging everyone to embrace physical activity as an integral part of their well-rounded lifestyle.

4,Is this economic stability sustainable?,"Taking a closer look at recent reform impact, inflation and impending IMF deal","Pakistan’s recent economic turmoil, which nearly pushed the country to the verge of bankruptcy last year, seems to have given way to a period of stability. However, a crucial question remains: is this a precursor to a genuine economic recovery, or a temporary respite?
There has been a noticeable decline in inflation from its peak last summer, coupled with stability in the Pakistani rupee, which is now hovering around Rs280 against the US dollar. Additionally, the current account deficit (CAD) has also narrowed, offering respite to the pressured forex reserves.
The expectation of political stability under a new government after a gap of almost two years gives one a glimmer of hope for a brighter future. Yet, it’s critical to scrutinise the looming economic risks as well.
Despite some positive developments, it is important to understand whether the economic stability seen under the caretaker government was the result of any significant or bold reforms that have solidified Pakistan’s financial foundation.
While the caretaker administration did initiate some commendable steps, such as successfully completing the last International Monetary Fund (IMF) review, bringing gas pricing reforms, and introducing an oil refining policy for both new and existing projects, it largely avoided tackling the more challenging decisions necessary for economic transformation.
For example, it failed to renegotiate more favourable terms with Chinese independent power producers (IPPs), implement essential energy sector reforms and overhaul the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) with comprehensive reforms.
Moreover, there was also a lack of initiative in increasing taxation on the retail trade, real estate revenues, and agriculture production to bring them at par with the taxes levied on the salaried individuals. The caretaker setup also could not privatise major state-owned entities like Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and Steel Mills, which have long been a financial drain on the country.

Furthermore, the actions the caretaker government did manage to take, like the gas pricing reforms, were implemented in a manner that left significant disparities in the market, with some sectors like textile mills and certain fertiliser plants still enjoying subsidised gas.
The new oil refining policy also fell short, failing to address the crippling issue of excessive regulation that has impeded the sector’s performance and growth.
Given these circumstances, it is difficult to put unwavering trust in the prevailing economic conditions. While one hopes and prays for sustainable economic stability, the glaring red flags raised high are too conspicuous to ignore.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, for instance, showed a 28.3% year-over-year increase in January, a slight decrease from December’s 29.7% and significantly down from May’s staggering 38% rise. While this latest deceleration might suggest a cooling inflation, which in February further came down to 23.1%, it’s crucial to consider the potential distortion from a high-base effect.
Moreover, the persistent 28% inflation rate remains a heavy burden for households already stretched thin financially.
Adding to these concerns are the recent increases in gas prices and the anticipated surge in food prices during Ramazan, which could keep inflation elevated or push it even higher.
Besides, the government’s recently announced 40% to 67% gas tariff hike for the protected category, effective from February 1, aligns with the IMF’s demands. This surge follows November’s fixed charges that significantly raised utility bills, with many households seeing an unprecedented triple-digit rise. The recent increase might also further strain inflation.
In addition, the stability of the domestic currency in its current position is uncertain, especially with the new government set to negotiate another deal with the IMF in a little over a month.
News reports indicate that Pakistan is contemplating increasing the size of the new bailout package to the range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion, from the $6 billion under Extended Fund Facility (EFF), by including climate financing.
Despite uncertainties around securing this increase, the impending talks pose a risk of exerting pressure on the rupee, potentially aggravating inflation further.
The rupee’s stability is also at risk due to potential weaknesses in the current account. Despite a notable 71% year-over-year reduction in the CAD to $1.09 billion in the first seven months of this fiscal year, the IMF projects a total deficit of $5.6 billion by the financial year’s close.
This projection suggests an expected increase in current account deficit to over $4.5 billion in the final five months, attributed to a predicted 56% surge in imports. This forecast contrasts sharply with the recent trend of declining imports.
The IMF’s stance suggests that current import restrictions have been pivotal in stabilising the rupee. Yet, an impending agreement with the IMF might eliminate these controls, steering Pakistan towards a market-determined exchange rate policy.
Such a shift could push imports substantially higher, increase the current account deficit, and mount pressure on the rupee, potentially exacerbating inflation.
In essence, the existing stability is underpinned in large part by the easing of inflation, rupee’s steadiness, and a shrinking of the current account deficit. However, there’s a looming risk that these positive trends could reverse in the next five months as Pakistan signs another bailout package with the IMF.
While there’s hope that the remittances and exports will come to the rescue, helping narrow the CAD, relying solely on hope is not a viable strategy.
The recent period of stability, therefore, may well be the calm before a looming storm. To navigate potential turbulence, policymakers must enact the crucial structural reforms mentioned earlier.
These measures are vital to ensure that, should a storm hit, the country emerges not just unscathed but in a stronger position.
