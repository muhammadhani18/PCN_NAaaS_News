2,Mega scam unearthed at Services: Hundreds of private institutes’ doctors get PG training at public hospital illegally,"Paying hefty amounts to private colleges, they did training/house job at Services and got BPS-17 pay; health dept launches probe.","LAHORE: In a mega medical scam, hundreds of doctors from private hospitals/institutes have completed their illegal/unauthorised postgraduate training and house job at the Services Hospital Lahore, blasting the Central Induction Policy and the rules under the nose of the senior medical teachers of the state-run medical institute.
Of them, 366 doctors of the private hospitals completed the unauthorised training and managed to get experience certifications while 107 others did house job at Services Hospital.
As per rules, for the PG training, only the doctors from the government medical institutes are allowed induction in the state-run hospitals through the Central Induction Policy, a criterion for selection of postgraduate residents in the public hospitals across the province.
 
 

The induction takes place twice a year with selection based purely on merit defined in Punjab Residency Programme (PRP) formula, notified by the health department. Not only this, such doctors of private medical institutes got away with stipend equal to the salary of a BPS-17 officer from the Services Hospital while they were enrolled in postgraduate programmes at the private institutes.
The most disturbing part of the illegal practice was that the College of Physicians & Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP) equally shared its role as all the 366 doctors from the private hospitals were recommended by the CPSP for training at the Services Hospital while the professors/heads of the various units/disciplines concerned of the hospital were also allegedly a part of the entire scam of the illegal postgraduate training and house job.

Paying hefty amounts to private colleges, they did training/house job at Services and got BPS-17 pay; health dept launches probe

According to some reports, some elements from the Young Doctors Association (YDA) of the Services Hospital were behind the induction of the unauthorised training and house job of the doctors from the private hospitals, starting from 2016.
According to the official documents, all 366 doctors have not only completed their PG training but also managed to obtain their certifications, a scam that may involve a huge network behind the illegal inductions of private medics in the government hospital. The scam was unearthed in the report of an inquiry conducted by the hospital, a copy is available with Dawn.
These medics completed PG training in various specialties, including nephrology, medicine, surgery, gynae, anaesthesia, pulmonology, plastic surgery etc. The documents revealed that they had come from private hospitals, including the National Hospital Lahore, Ghurki Trust & Teaching Hospital Lahore, Fatima Memorial Hospital, Avicenna Medical College, Omar Hospital & Medical Centre, Shalimar Hospital, Hameed Latif Hospital, Allama Iqbal Memorial Hospital, Shaukat Khanum Hospital, Ittefaq Hospital, University College of Dentistry Lahore, Kishwar Fazal Teaching Hospital Sheikhupura, etc.
Some senior officials pointed out the issue, especially the CPSP’s role being a national regulatory body, saying it was responsible for ensuring the standards and providing the facilities available in the institutions to maintain quality training for its trainees.
“Why has the CPSP failed so far in providing postgraduate training to the doctors of the private institutes in their respective health facilities despite charging hefty amounts/fees from them against various services, including PG training?” an official asks.
 
 

If the private hospitals mentioned above have no faculty at their respective facilities and they were sending their doctors to the government hospitals for PG training, why the CPSP offered them postgraduate programmes, he adds.
During an investigation, the official says, it shocked many when it transpired that several doctors of the private hospitals who had completed PG training at the Services Hospital were also paid stipend equal to the salary package of a BPS-17 officer.
The payment of stipend to the doctors of the private hospitals from the government exchequer in the Services Hospital is another bigger crime that must be investigated at a higher forum, comprising impartial officers, he suggests, adding that those responsible for these blatant violations should also be punished as per their shared role.
The initial inquiry report of the blatant violations of unauthorised PG training and house job has been sent to the Punjab health department for action. In the report, the institute attached the list of 366 doctors with names, date and period of their PG training against the specialties and the private hospitals/institutes they belonged to.
“It is submitted that these PGRs had applied for rotation from private institutes to the Services Hospital Lahore for training in different faculties,” reads the report.
It pointed out with grave concern that the parent institutes of these doctors have not got the required faculty but they inducted the postgraduate residents for training.
“This is grave violation of the PG trainees policy/guidelines,” reads the report further unveiling that the private institutes from where the doctors came for training had no memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Services Hospital Lahore.
About the house job, the report said, a ‘house job committee,’ notified by the Services Hospital, held a meeting on Nov 7, 2023 for supplementary MBBS examination 2023 and inducted its own 200 candidates as per the available seats later on Nov 16.
“It has come to notice that the 107 doctors (from private institutes) are doing their house job in different wards/units without any approval from the House Job Committee,” reads the report.
It says that they were ‘unauthorisedly’ working in the wards and any clinical/non-clinical mishap shall have repercussions for the Services Hospital administration.
Services Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Munir Malik has confirmed to Dawn that the grave violations have been unearthed in the induction of the illegal/unauthorised PG training and house job, saying he has sent a report to the health department for further action.
A senior officer of the Punjab health department says the authorities have launched investigations into the scam as reported by the Services Hospital Lahore. He says the health secretary has constituted a three-member committee of senior officers of the department.
The additional secretary (establishment) of the specialised healthcare department Punjab has been made its convener while the deputy secretary (budgets & accounts and the director finance of the Punjab Institute of Cardiology are its members.
The official says the committee has been directed to start proceedings as per the terms of references elaborated/defined in the notified committee.
“The committee shall collect the evidence and fix responsibility regarding violation of the department’s policy,” he adds.

4,PTI worker hospitalised after police torture at GPO Chowk; IGP denies,"Party claims he sustained fierce blows to his head, leading to his transfer to the ICU where he is currently fighting for his life.","LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has vehemently condemned the ‘brutal torture’ of citizens peacefully protesting against rigging in elections at GPO Chowk on March 2, following reports that one of the torture victims has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Lahore General Hospital on Sunday.
According to the PTI, Ahmad Shah, a young man, was allegedly arrested during Saturday’s PTI protest at GPO Chowk and subjected to severe torture while in custody. The party claims that the youth sustained fierce blows to his head, leading to his transfer to the ICU at Lahore General Hospital, where he is currently fighting for his life.
A police spokesman said Ahmad Shah sustained injuries when he ran to avoid arrest but fell on road in the process at the GPO Chowk. He said Shah was stable and scans at LGH showed no fracture.
IGP Usman Anwar told Dawn that Shah was in police commando outfit when police tried to arrest him. He said this illegal act on the part of Shah was also part of FIR registered on Saturday.
Sharing a video depicting several policemen guarding Ahmad Shah’s ICU bed, PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar stated that the victim’s family members and lawyers were not allowed to meet him. Azhar also alleged that the police abducted Ahmad Shah’s brother when he arrived at the hospital.
In addition, Mr Azhar revealed that the police had filed a torture case against a PTI worker named Arshad, who was arrested alongside Ahmad Shah at GPO Chowk. He announced the dispatch of lawyers and senior party leaders to gather details from the hospital.
 






PTI leader Mehr Sharafat Ali, who contested against Maryam Nawaz, tweeted that Ahmad Shah had slipped into a coma. Urging the public and party workers to converge at Lahore General Hospital, Mr. Ali expressed concerns about potential tragic outcomes, similar to the Zill-i-Shah murder. He shared a video footage capturing Ahmad Shah’s arrest by the police.
Mr Azhar, in another tweet, criticized the new government, stating, “This motley crew of PML-N and PPP was utterly rejected in the polls.” He accused the establishment of recycling old political figures and labeled anyone questioning it as a traitor. Mr Azhar predicted that this government, formed with the establishment’s consent, would soon collapse, and the masses would reclaim the power to elect their leaders.
PTI secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan has demanded that an FIR for torture on Ahmad Shah should be registered against IG Punjab Dr Usman Anwar. He stated Ahmad Shah was arrested during a peaceful protest in Lahore and tortured.
“He (Ahmad Shah) is in a critical condition in the Lahore General Hospital,” Mr Ayub said and added that he had stated in his speech in the National Assembly that “PML-N is a fascist party being led by its fascist PM Shahbaz Sharif and CM Maryam Nawaz”. “Condemn this in the strongest words possible,” he stated.

7,"Punjab notes: Mela Chiraghan: mystic, drum and dance","Mela Chiraghan, (the festival of lights) is the festival of Lahore held every year to pay tribute to poet and Saint...","Mela Chiraghan, (the festival of lights) is the festival of Lahore held every year to pay tribute to poet and Saint Madho Lal Husain aka Shah Husain. His presence on our cultural and literary landscape has a haunting quality; his life and poetry both are mysteriously challenging and thought-provoking. Interest in him is undying as is shown by the books and studies on him that have come out in the last few years.  
Nain Sukh’s novel ‘Madho Lal’ published some years ago was a serious attempt to understand Shah Husain’s unusual life in socio-historical perspective but somehow it became controversial because of author’s boldness as it tried to explore the mystery of Shah Husain’s relationship with his disciple Madho Lal whom he fell in love with. His no holds barred approach provoked an irate response from those who held Shah Husain in high esteem placing him on a pedestal that was beyond the reach of what they call carnal desires.  
Another book appeared last year in Urdu language titled ‘Ishq Nama’ by Farrukh Yar on Shah Husain’s life and poetry. It’s a scholarly study done painstakingly that traces the evolution of Sufism in Arabia, Iran, Central Asia and Indian subcontinent with focus on Shah Husain. This book of rare erudition can help us understand the visible and arcane aspects of Sufi tradition. Additionally, it offers probably the best Urdu translations of his lyrics.  
The latest book on Madho Lal Husain is ‘The Sufi’s Nightingale’ by Sarbpreet Singh who is a fiction writer, historian and author, based in the USA. It’s a novel about Shah Husain’s life that mainly explores his spiritual odyssey. Sadly, the book is not available to general readers in Pakistan at the moment. 
The desire to decode the mystique that surrounds Madho Lal Husain Husain’s personality and creative expression is well-founded. He was a highly educated young man when he underwent a radical transformation. It is reliably reported that when he was praying in a congregation he heard the prayer leader reciting a verse of Quran that said something to the effect that life of this world was nothing but playfulness. The verse is traditionally interpreted as a warning against attachment to ephemeral worldly pleasures. But he inferred a completely different conclusion, left the mosque and declared that life was little more than playfulness. From that point on living playfully became his practice. Consequently, a unique theme emerged in his poetry; the metaphor of playfulness signifying concrete life became an integral element of his poetry. ‘Mother, let me play / who else would play my inning (ni, maae manu khedan de / mera vutt khedan kaun aasi)’? In another Kafi (lyrics) he says: ‘Playfulness is our destiny / the Lord himself bestowed it upon us (Hassan khedan bha asaday, ditta Rabb ji aap asaanu).’ After such a transformation poetry, music and dance became an inseparable part of his being, not merely at an abstract or theoretical level but as actual life practice. This is what provoked the irate clergy who was well aware that Shah Husain was a great scholar and well-versed in Islamic law and yet, in their opinion, was deviating from it.  
Prince Dara Shikoh writes in his book ‘Hasnaatul Arifeen’ that matter was reported to the Chief Qazi Abdullah Sultanpuri. He wanted to punish Shah Husain. When the Qazi entered Lahore followed by a dazzling cavalcade, bazaars and streets were closed to facilitate his arrival but he noticed that a man in a red robe was right in the middle of the street least pushed about the protocol. He asked as to who the man was. He was told that it was Husain Dhuda, the same man against whom he already had received complaints for indulging in apparently non-Islamic practices. 
When Husain was summoned, he held the rein of Qazi’s horse and said: ’you know, how many are the basic Islamic tenets? Well, five! We both believe in the oneness of God. I don’t fast nor do I say my prayer. Haj (pilgrimage to Mecca) and Zakat (religious tax) are not applicable in my case as I am not rich enough. You are rich enough but you don’t pay zakat and haven’t performed your Haj. You like me are a violator of two injunctions. How come that you would sit in judgment on me?’ The Qazi responded by moving ahead.
Another theme clearly reflected in the verses of the poet who would sing and dance in the streets of metropolitan Lahore is his vivid experience of alienation especially that of alienated labour which was theorised by Karl Marx much later in the 19th century. “What a relief to see my spinning wheel broken! / I got rid of torture (bhal bhaya mera charkha bhann, meri jind azabon chhuti)”, he says in one of his lyrics.  
In another delicately beautiful song, he juxtaposes work principle with pleasure principle in an artistic display of disarming simplicity. Employing the metaphor of a female weaver, he shows a stark difference between work and pleasure and the rejection of the former: “A ring adorns my finger / how can I work? / Red shoes adorn my feet / how can I spread myself out to manage the weft?” 
People celebrate this poet-saint at the start of spring every year by lighting lamps. That lamps stand for light and illumination which dispel darkness is very obvious. But the act may also have a mythical connection with god Agni that now seems vague and has become part of our collective subconscious. Secondly, spring is also time of regeneration and rebirth. Mustard flowers and kite flying traditionally figured prominently in the spring (Basant) celebrations. Images of the both are found in Shah Husain’s poetry: “mustard flowers in bloom are not forever (Sada na Phullan toriya)” and “I am my beloved’s kite (mein saajan di guddi).”  
Mustard crop is no longer seen in Lahore and kite flying has been banned by the philistine bureaucracy of Punjab in the name of public safety. But who can forget what the saint says in his declamatory mood? “This is the only business I am familiar with; we would dance together.” — soofi01@hotmail.com

As per data released by the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA), a total of 8.393m bales of cotton were received by the ginning factories across the country till Feb 29, which is 72pc more than the previous year but a record 32pc less than the official target.
Cotton production in Punjab remained 43pc more and in Sindh a record 119pc more than the last crop year.
Textile mills have so far purchased around 7.892m bales and exporters 293,000 bales, but more than 200,000 bales are still available for sale with the ginning factories.
Pakistan Cotton Brokers Association secretary Sundas Ayub says a stock of 0.2m bales apparently appears to be too small in view of the time to start a new season, but lean demand amid poor economic situation is keeping the business activities at low ebb.
Explaining the crisis, Cotton Ginners Forum chairman Ihsanul Haq says that besides overall national economic slowdown, the textile sector is facing a severe financial crisis because of higher production cost due to soaring power and gas tariff as well as a steep hike in taxes on the industry.
He says there is a wave of serious concern in the sector, as there is also an unusual delay in cotton cultivation in most of the cotton zones across the country for the next season due to extremely adverse weather conditions.
He says that the newly-formed federal government should immediately announce a cut in electricity, gas and loan markup rates for the export textile sector to help recover it, recalling that the SIFC had approved the reduction in power rates from 14 cents to nine cents for the export textile sector.
Cotton trading in Pakistan remained quite limited during the last week, with prices ranging between Rs21,500 and Rs22,000 per maund, while the New York Cotton Exchange saw an unusual trend during which cotton prices reached the highest level of one dollar and three cents per pound before falling back to 95.57 cents.
Mr Haq says that cotton sowing is being severely affected due to the record low temperature because of rains along with Sindh’s coastal districts of Badin and Thatta, as well as in most of the cotton zones of Punjab.
Meanwhile, the final cotton production data will be released on April 3, 2024 instead of March 18, 2024, and it is expected around 30,000 more bales will reach the ginners during this one month.
On the other hand, the Federal Committee on Agriculture usually releases cotton production figures and fixes production target for the next crop year as well as its intervention price in the second week of February every year. But, it has not met yet this year though the month of March has begun.

The protesters claimed that the Badami Bagh station house officer (SHO) conducted an illegal raid on the house, resulting in the shooting and injury of Zilly Shah.
The police refuted the allegations, saying that the suspect opened fire on the raiding police team, leading to an encounter. 
According to the police account, both Zilly Shah and a police constable sustained gunshot injuries and were taken to a local hospital. The police identified the suspect as a drug peddler.
However, protesters contended that the SHO was intentionally distorting the issue to conceal his wrongdoing. They asserted that he breached privacy by forcefully entering the house without female staff present. 
The protesters claimed that the SHO and his team assaulted family members, verbally abused them, and injured Shah when he protested against the humiliation of the females and the violation of privacy.
