0,"Once bitten, twice shy: Stray dog attacks spread trepidation",Local bodies had claimed that work would be done on a scientific basis to stop the uncontrolled breeding of wild dogs,"Nobody stepping outside of the house for work, errands or recreation anticipates making an unexpected trip to the nearest emergency room after being bitten by a random stray dog lurking around the road however, as an uncontrolled breeding of stray dogs in the port city leads to a growing population of wild canines seeking their next victim, families leaving their houses might have to accommodate an unforeseen dog bite in their schedules.
Nonetheless, the plight of the injured locals and their families does not end when they reach the closest hospital since a shortage of the rabies vaccine, only exacerbates their anxiety over the sudden predicament.
For instance, Shahrukh, a resident of Liaquatabad, encountered a similar situation when his eight year old son was bitten by a dog just outside his house “Instead of dropping him off to school, I had to rush him to the emergency at the Abbassi Shaheed Hospital, where there was no vaccine available for rabies,” shared Shahrukh.
Similarly, Khurram, another local, conveyed his exasperation at having to dodge wild, stray dogs during the dark hours of the night. “Stray dogs bark at the sight of an unknown person, and when the person attempts to escape, the ferocious canines start chasing them before they finally attack. Not only do these dogs attack pedestrians but they also chase people riding motorcycles,” revealed Khurram, who further added that no interest was shown by the authorities in addressing such unfortunate incidents.
According to Javed Qureshi, a senior journalist, the abundance of stray dogs lurking around different areas of Karachi including Lyari, Baldia Town, Liaquatabad, Sher Shah, Orangi Town, Malir, North Karachi and Kemari, has reached an alarmingly high level, due to which the citizens are very worried.
“The local bodies had claimed that work would be done on a scientific basis to stop the uncontrolled breeding of wild dogs, but this matter has also been postponed. Moreover, many government hospitals do not have access to the medications required for treating dog bites,” claimed Qureshi.
“So far, the local authorities have been unable to devise a policy for curbing the breeding of stray dogs in Karachi. Special units for the treatment of dog bites must be set up in all government hospitals on an urgent basis,” assessed Kaleem-ul-Haq Usmani, Nazim of the local union council.
Expanding on the matter, Dr Romana Farhat, Head of Anti-rabies Management Planning at the Civil Hospital, warned that a dog bite can lead to a fatal rabies infection in case the wound is not immediately treated, and a vaccine is not available.

“Once infected by the rabies virus, the patient’s body starts to change. Their eyes turn red and sensitive, and they also develop a fever. Death is highly likely if the rabies virus is transmitted to the human body and treatment is not given” explained Dr Farhat, who added that treating a dog bite costs anywhere between Rs1000 to Rs7000.
“Our hospital does not have access to the anti-rabies vaccine. Therefore, when an infected patient comes to the hospital, they have to arrange the vaccine themselves,” confirmed Dr Naseem, Medical Superintendent at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
The lack of access of hospitals to the anti-rabies vaccine is evident in the high number of patients who developed rabies after a dog bite. As per a report by the Indus Hospital, in 2023, 13,000 people were diagnosed with rabies, out of which five died during treatment.
Similarly, according to Dr Khalid Bukhari, Dr Nausheen, and Dr Atiq, respective representatives of the Civil Hospital, Jinnah Hospital and Liaquatabad Hospital, a total of 26,460 cases of rabies were reported in 2023.
Speaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, Samira Hussain, the Project Director of the Rabies Control Program said, “Three centers have been set up in Karachi to control the population of stray dogs. A scientific method involving the usage of special injections, will be adopted to stop the breeding of stray dogs.”

1,Steel Mills seeks SIFC help to retrieve occupied land,PSM administration writes letter to Ministry of Industries and Production,"The administration of Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) has appealed to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to help retrieve thousands of acres of its land taken over by encroachers.
In a letter addressed to the Ministry of Industries and Production, the PSM administration has sought the SIFC intervention to reclaim the land unlawfully occupied and to address issues related to the allotment of land without proper mutation by various departments of the Sindh government.
The letter stresses the need for the ministry to engage in discussions with the Sindh government to resolve land disputes worth billions of rupees concerning PSM. It highlights the importance of the committee established by the apex committee of SIFC, specifically tasked with addressing issues related to the PSM land.
Morover, the PSM administration has called upon the federal and Sindh governments for assistance in resolving outstanding issues regarding their land. These issues include the removal of encroachments from Pakistan Steel Township, annulment of illegal allotments and occupation in Gulshan-e-Hadid Phase III, and the allocation of 2,000 acres of land owned by PSM by various Sindh departments without proper mutation allotment.
The plea to the federal government extends to seek help for the re-determination and demarcation of the outer boundary of Pakistan Steel Township, as well as the pending allotment of 400 acres of alternative land for the oil tanker terminal established by the Sindh government.

Similarly, assistance is sought from the federal government to reclaim the 1,377 acres of land currently held by the Sindh government in Pakistan Steel Township. The apex committee of SIFC has proposed the establishment of an export processing zone (EPZ) or special economic zone (SEZ) on the PSM land, a decision made in the 430th meeting of the PSM Board on January 15, 2024.
During this meeting, the board was apprised of the directive from the apex committee of SIFC, restraining the management of PSM from any further transfer of its land. A three-member committee, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Production, Ministry of Privatization, and the Sindh Chief Minister, has also been formed to oversee the establishment of the SEZ.
The PSM Board has pledged unwavering support for the implementation of this decision and has appealed for the long-standing issues concerning PSM land to be raised before the Sindh chief minister through the platform of SIFC's apex committee, ultimately resulting in the return of thousands of acres of PSM land.

7,New govt urged to regulate agri input prices,"Growers' body says lack of regulation, missing research and development hurting agricultural economy","As relentless inflation in the agricultural input prices and poor quality crop seeds continue to affect both the farmers and general public alike, the new government has been asked to take decisive steps for regulation and seed development.
The farmers at a meeting of the Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB), a farmers' lobbying group, in Hyderabad on Sunday pointed out how the lax regulation and missing research and development are hurting the agricultural economy and produce as well as the people.
""... this lack of governance is hurting growers, consumers and the economy,"" said a statement issued after the meeting which was presided by SAB's Mahmood Nawaz Shah. The growers while welcoming the new federal and provincial governments called for dedicated measures to address the highlighted issues.
Overpriced inputs
The agrarian community's representatives pointed out that the price of urea, which is the highest utilized fertilizer in Pakistan, is increasing every other month. A bag of urea was being sold at Rs2,900 12 months ago but at present its price is Rs4,649. However, the commodity is even not easily available at that soared price in a large number of areas in the province, they lamented.
The SAB estimates that between Rs60 to Rs70 billion over and above the MRP [maximum retail price] were profiteered from the growers in the last six months alone. The prices of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and potash fertilisers, pesticides, other nutrients and fuel are also going up day by day without any check and balance by the government, the farmers deplored.

The board complained that the prices are jacked up overnight and the companies as well as their dealers make billions of rupees in unjustifiable income by selling the old stock at the new rates to the farmers.
The SAB's members said the artificial enhancement in the cost of the inputs consequently increased the cost of their produce and, thereby, contributed to the cycle of inflation which has been badly affecting the people of Pakistan. The SAB urged the government to strictly regulate the prices of urea and other inputs in the interest of the country's ailing economy and the population which has been burdened with unprecedented inflation.
Seeds
The farmers spotlighted that non-availability of quality seed continued to constrain their crop yields. They gave an example of the cotton seed whose germination as per the international standard is 80 per cent 50 per cent germination of seeds sold in Pakistan. According to them, absence of quality checks and a lack of research and development initiatives are the causes behind the malaise.
The board referred to the lethargic functionality of the Provincial Seed Council as another reason. The council, which authorized and registered seeds, is supposed to meet once every month. But in Sindh the last meeting was held around a year ago.
The farmers complained that staying aloof from biotechnology is one more factor hampering development of new seeds which are now supposed to be resilient to climate change, droughts, pests and diseases. They requested the government to kick-start the process of harnessing biotechnology in collaboration with the private sector to develop improved varieties of seeds.
They demanded that over 6,000 acres of land of the Sindh Seed Corporation should be utilised for seed development instead of keeping the land idle. The SAB also called for rewarding the scientists who create new quality seeds and to enforce the intellectual property rights law in a robust way as a safeguard for the inventors and producing companies.
D. Bashir Nizamani, Syed Nadeem Shah, Mohammed Aslam Mari, Malook Nizamani, Syed Salman Shah, Mustafa Nawaz Shah, Malik Nizamani, Shahnawaz Behmani and other farmers attended the meeting.
