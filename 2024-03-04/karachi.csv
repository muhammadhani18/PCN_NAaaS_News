0,Uzair Baloch acquitted in rioting case for ‘lack of evidence’,"ATC judge points out that alleged perpetrator Abdul Ghaffar, alias Mama, has already been released in this case."," 


KARACHI: An antiterrorism court has acquitted chief of the outlawed Peoples Amn Committee Uzair Baloch and three others in a 12-year-old case pertaining to rioting and an assault on police.
The ATC-VI judge, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against Uzair Baloch; Zakir, alias Dada; Ghulam Muhammad, alias Ghulamo; and Salam, alias Mullah Nisar.
The judge acquitted them due to lack of evidence against them.
The judge pointed out that alleged perpetrator Abdul Ghaffar, alias Mama, had already been released in this case.
 
 

The court highlighted lacunas in the prosecution case and posed a question as to why the accused, Uzair, who was arrested in 2016, was formally apprehended in this case six years later.
“The cropped-up point that needs the attention of this court is that when the instant crime took place on April 13, 2012, and the accused was in custody since 2016, why he was not nabbed in this crime earlier and how after about six years he was formally arrested in the instant crime. No answer on this point has been advanced by Inspector Muhammad Rafique [second IO],” the judge observed.
He directed prison authorities to release them forthwith if their custody was not required in any other case.
It needs to be mentioned here that the Lyari kingpin, Uzair Baloch, who is facing other criminal cases pending before ATC and sessions courts, is unlikely to be released immediately.
According to the prosecution, a police officer from Kalakot police station, while on patrol in April 2012, responded to a tip-off that a group of individuals around 200 to 300 in Lyari, near Aath Chowk, were pelting stones at vehicles and blocking the road.
Upon arrival at the scene, the informant briefed the police officer that the alleged Lyari gangster, Uzair, along with the co-accused, was present with deadly weapons, including hand grenades.
Upon seeing the police, the accused opened fire and used hand grenades on the police party, causing damage to their armoured personnel carrier. Subsequently, additional law enforcement personnel arrived at the scene, but the accused managed to flee.
A case was registered under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 3/4 of the Explosive Substance Act read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
The alleged gangster is facing trial in dozens of cases pertaining to murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, extortion, and encounters with law enforcers.
So far, he has been acquitted in more than two dozen cases mainly due to lack of evidence or due to the benefit of the doubt.
In April 2020, a military court sentenced Uzair to 12 years in jail in an espionage case.

1,Karachiites taken aback by ‘forward March’ of cold weather,"Rain compels citizens to unpack wrapped up woollies, bring broth to the table."," 

Once again, chicken soup sells like hot cakes as good old days of friends catching up with gossip around bonfire return after a day’s rain in Karachi.—Shakil Adil / White Star

KARACHI: The city gets chilly for barely a few days. Hence, the citizens here don’t make big preparations to counter the weather conditions. During the winter a blanket should do as long as no one switches on the fans or air conditioners. Then a mug of steaming tea or coffee is enough to warm the soul and relax the mind.
As February drew to a close and spring was officially here, a day of rain threw a spanner into the sun’s warmth and all spring cleaning plans.
The quilts and blankets, wrapped up and folded before being pushed to the top compartments of cupboards were needed once again. Someone or the other was sent to the neighbours again with a request to borrow their folding ladder, again. The jackets and sweaters, too, were brought out and shaken to get the mothballs out.
“Thankfully, it has not been that long for them to be packed in storage for the smell of mothballs to sink in,” a homemaker in my neighbourhood smiled and shrugged.
Well-known clothing brands had already put sale tags on their warm clothing. “They must be regretting it now because suddenly people are buying these,” said one customer looking at designer jackets and woollies at a mall on Sunday.

Rain compels citizens to unpack wrapped up woollies, bring broth to the table

A cousin said that she had started looking at recipes on YouTube to get some ideas about salads. “But we are back to aloo gosht and chicken curry,” she laughed.
 
 

Sher Khan, the chicken soup seller in Kharadar, was also back to selling his popular warm chicken broth. “I usually stop making yakhni by the end of February. But it is so cold, suddenly, and my customers are demanding it, so here I am back with what they want,” he said.
The boiled eggs seller with a cart in Liaquatabad also had a similar story to share as he sprinkled salt and pepper on freshly boiled and pealed eggs cut into four pieces and served in small plastic plates.
Dried fruit, roasted peanuts, popcorn and corn on the cob, too, are more in demand than cold drinks and ice cream. The guy on the bicycle with a big kettle and thermos full of hot tea was also finding more customers early morning and in the evening.
The shops with quilts and blankets heaped over each other by the footpath were also glad to be back in business.
Also back were the little campfires by the roadside where people sat down for a bit to chat while warming their hands. The warm glow of the flames reflected in their eyes and brought a radiance to their faces. “It feels like winter is rewound and being replayed,” said an individual enjoying the company at one such cosy gathering.

3,Murad vows to approach PM for release of funds required for K-IV project,Says Centre had allocated Rs16bn but released only Rs4bn.,"KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said on Sunday that he would approach Prime Minister-elect Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the issue of delay in release of funds by the federal government for the much-awaited Greater Karachi Water Supply Project, commonly known as K-IV.
Speaking to reporters at the office of the Election Commission of Pakistan here, he said that the federal government had allocated Rs16 billion for the project, but released only Rs4bn so far.
He expressed concern that the project would suffer more delays if the remaining funds were not released soon.
Accompanied by PPP leaders who filed nomination papers for contesting elections on two Senate vacant seats in Sindh, the CM stated that the PM-elect would take the oath of his position on Monday and it was his primary responsibility to strengthen the economy.

Says Centre had allocated Rs16bn but released only Rs4bn

“People are currently facing an unprecedented rise in prices and the new federal government will have to take steps to address this issue. This can only be achieved by withdrawing subsidies being enjoyed by the elite,” he said.
CM Shah stated that he intended to write a letter to the new prime minister, requesting for the completion of the K-IV project.
 
 

He emphasised that the K-IV project was crucial to meet the water requirements of the city.
About the upcoming Senate elections, the CM said that the PPP candidates would easily be elected as senators from the provincial assembly.
“We need only 108 votes for the two seats and we have 114 votes in the house. We will get our candidates elected easily for which I am congratulating [former] president Asif Ali Zardari,” he said.
In response to a question, the chief minister said that Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab was working tirelessly to turn Karachi into one of the most advanced cities in the world.
“As an elected mayor, he has all the necessary powers,” he said, adding that any changes in the local government law would be made by the Sindh Assembly.
Commenting on the PML-N’s agreement with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan regarding an empowered local government system, the CM was of the view that the PML-N could not make amendments to the local government law as demanded by the MQM-P since it had not a single MPA in the Sindh Assembly.
He said that at present the MQM-P leadership was in Islamabad for the election of the prime minister and “we will approach them for the presidential election”.
He admitted that the MQM-P and the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council had stakes in Sindh. “I want to take all the stakeholders together so that the issues of the province can be resolved with collective wisdom.”
He said that maintenance of law and order was the responsibility of the provincial government for which he hads given necessary instructions to the police and Rangers. “We will soon rid Karachi of street criminals and riverine area of dacoit gangs,” he said.
About protest by the Grand Democratic Alliance, the CM said that despite Pir Pagara’s announcement that MPAs-elect of the GDA would not take the oath the lawmakers got themselves notified from the Election Commission and took the oath.

4,Survey finds waterfowl population slightly increased in Sindh,"Wildlife dept spots over 639,122 birds during annual survey that began in December and ended last month","KARACHI: Over 60 waterfowl species spotted in a recent survey conducted by the Sindh wildlife department at 30 water bodies across the province.
A total of 639,122 birds were recorded during the annual waterfowl survey conducted between December 2023 and February 2024.
Officials said that most of the species were either digitally recorded for the first time or spotted after a long period.
They said that the total population of waterfowls recorded during the current period was greater than last year’s count of 613,000.
The water bodies where the recent survey was conducted included nine sites in Nangarparkar, Lungh Lake, Drigh Lake and Hammal Lake (all three in Qambar Shahdadkot), Mehrano Lake in Khairpur, Manchhar Lake in Jamshoro, Chutiyari Dam in Sanghar, Keenjhar Lake in Thatta, Port Qasim, Hub Dam and Russian Beach in Karachi.

The species digitally recorded for the first time included bar-headed goose, cotton pygmy goose, Indian spot billed duck, oriental darter, Asian woolly necked stroke, red-naped ibis, black-headed ibis, black-necked grebe, jack snipe, lesser flamingo and Indian cormorant,
The species seen after a long time included great crested grebe, white stork and lesser whistling duck.
According to officials, the Nurr-ri lagoon of Badin district, like previous years, has remained to be the richest spot in the province in terms of bird population (168,964) followed by the area of Run of Kutch in Nagarparkar (117,790).
The survey findings showed that a significant numbers of waterfowls had selected new areas for their brief stay.
World Wildlife Day
The release of the survey’s findings coincided with the World Wildlife Day observed every year on March 3. 
This year’s theme is Connecting People and Planet: Exploring Digital Innovation in Wildlife Conservation.
“Digital technology has brought revolutionary changes in life. Not only the ways of communication and our working have become smarter and efficient, the technology has been very helpful in wildlife conservation and creating public awareness,” shared Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar.
He added that the technology had also helped in taking action against illegal hunting in the province.
About the survey, he said that its findings represented the minimum number of birds present at a specific place at a given time.
“Last year’s floods seemed to have a positive impact on the wildlife habitats, though the natural calamity caused unprecedented damage to infrastructure, agriculture and livestock,” he said.
The provincial wildlife department had been releasing annual waterfowl census since the 1980s, he pointed out while agreeing that surveys needed to be carried out for other wildlife species as well.

5,This week 50 years ago: Meat crisis and railway workers’ strike,"WHILE Karachi faces many a civic problem all year round, in recent times one has seldom heard about meat-based meals...","WHILE Karachi faces many a civic problem all year round, in recent times one has seldom heard about meat-based meals not being cooked for a few days in the Sindh capital. It happened half a century back. On March 4, 1974 it was reported that the day before nearly two-thirds of meat shops in the city remained closed as a result of which people had to resort to cooking vegetables at home. Apparently, over the week there was an increase of more than 20 percent in the prices of meat dishes at hotels and restaurants. A number of relatively less expensive eateries had already closed shop since they were not doing desirable business due to the high rates of raw meat, which was the reason that the owners of the eating houses cited for their price increase. They also complained that their permanent suppliers were not supplying meat to them on a regular basis.
On March 5, after a discussion with meat-sellers, the deputy commissioner of the city forwarded recommendations to the Sindh government for resolving the crisis. Although he did not reveal his recommendations to the media, he was hopeful that it would resolve the issue to the satisfaction of both meat-sellers and consumers. It was learnt that the government might agree for a slight increase in the prices. At least 2,000 out of the 3,000 shops kept their shutters down on March 4 and the butchers continued charging more than the controlled rates, that is, Rs11 to Rs12 for mutton per seer and Rs5 to Rs6 for beef per seer. The controlled rates were Rs7 for mutton and Rs3.75 for beef.
As expected, on March 7, poultry wasin great demand in Karachi. People were seen buying chickens in a large number as they feared the situation would continue for a few days. Most of the popular nihari and kebab shops switched over to selling either murgh qorma or murgh nihari. And Burns Road was almost deserted on March 7.
If that was not enough to disturb Karchiites’ peace, on March 9, the railway workers at Karachi City Cantonment and Keamari went on a lightning strike for over five hours. All express and shuttle trains were delayed by about six hours and work at Karachi port suffered, too. The workers belonging to the Labour Union of PWR opted not to work to demonstrate their strength against their rivals, the United Railway Workers Union, the official bargaining agent or PWR, after a little altercation between the two groups.
While this was going on, on March 6, it was announced that the federal government would spend six crore rupees on constructing 2786 multi-storey flats and 78 shops for employees of the central government at various colonies in the city. At the time, 11,000 central government employees [more than 50 percent of which belonged to low-income groups] were without official accommodation and were on the waiting list of the government’s Estate Office. In the first phase of the project, 1,268 flats were being built in Federal Area and Liaquatabad.

6,"Environmental pollutants major risk factor for kidney disease, experts say","KARACHI: While discussing critical issues concerning kidney health in developing countries, senior nephrologists at...","KARACHI: While discussing critical issues concerning kidney health in developing countries, senior nephrologists at an international conference at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) shared their concern over environmental deterioration that, they said, was having an ‘alarming impact’ on kidney health.
They were speaking on the second day of the 14th Biennial Conference of Pakistan Society of Nephrology (PSN).
According to experts, while people are generally aware of the serious threat posed by diabetes to their kidney health, little awareness exists on the environmental risk factors.
Environmental pollutants, they said, were believed to have been playing a significant role in the growing prevalence of chronic kidney disease. In this respect, they referred to some recent Pakistani data showing that a significant number of patients suffered from end-stage kidney disease from “unknown causes” followed by kidney stones.
The kidney health challenges in Pakistan, they feared, might aggravate if preventive strategies were not developed to tackle the increasing numbers of diabetics as well as environmental degradation.
They emphasised the need for community-based studies, a holistic kidney registry, and randomised controlled trials to gain a deeper understanding of the disease and tailored-strategies for specific treatment.
The speakers acknowledged the limitations of current treatment options available for end-stage-kidney disease patients in Pakistan. Hemodialysis, the primary available modality, it was pointed out, posed environmental concerns due to high energy consumption and water depletion.
Furthermore, it was said, kidney transplantation programmes hadn’t expanded sufficiently to meet the demand. The lack of society’s participation in deceased organ donation programme and peritoneal dialysis adoption remained limited due to insufficient industry support and interest in government healthcare initiatives.
The experts who shared their insights included Dr Umar Farooq, Prof Kieran McCafferty, Prof Edwina Brown, Prof Stanely Lin-sun FAN, Prof M. Magdi Yqoob, Prof Fazal Akhtar, Prof Nisar Anwar, Dr Mudassar Hussain, Prof Aasim Ahmed and Prof Mirza Naqi Zafar.

The Counter Terrorism Department of Karachi police said in a statement that ‘gang leader’ Najeebullah and his aide Saddam were arrested in a raid on intelligence reports.  
The police also recovered arms and ammunition from their possession, it said.  
“The gang is the most fearsome and organised group of armed bandits,” said the statement quoting its chief Raja Umar Khattab as saying.  
“It comprises 10 members who are all Afghans. They all are wanted in several cases of armed robberies, street crimes and murder. Najeebullah is the leader of the gang and wanted by Karachi police in several cases.”  
On Feb 13 two of the gang members had killed policeman Abdul Wahid in North Karachi during an armed mugging attempt, the statement added.  
During the initial investigation, the arrested suspects shared with the police the names of their gang members who were involved in the policeman’s killing, said the statement.  
“The members of the gang are frequent visitors to Afghanistan. And after every major job, they run away to the neighbouring country and return back after every a few weeks,” it added.  
The suspects were wanted in several cases registered with Sachal, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Sohrab Goth, Gulberg and Bahadurabad police stations.  
They had been arrested in the past, but had been freed from jail after getting bail, the statement concluded.

Speaking at the 8th edition of Women Tech Quest (WTQ), Jehan Ara, the former president of P@SHA and CEO of Katalyst Labs, said women’s participation in technology is crucial to enhancing the productivity of the tech business because of their different ways of thinking, execution, and performance.
She mentioned that women in Pakistan are talented, hardworking, and performing a leading role in innovation at their workplaces, which is an encouraging trend for growing up female-generating across the country.
Maha Shahzad, founder and CEO of Buscaro, said working opportunities have been increasing for women in Pakistan, both onsite and remotely, but they should cope with challenges and barriers to grow their careers and achieve their goals along with a family.
She added that women in Pakistan could perform well in every field and every role from entry to C level, including founding their own startups and raising funds from investors despite problems and cultural mindsets.
Over 1200 women in technology from across the three cities took part in WTQ which took place in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.

10,Health dept sitting on LUH request for PET scan machine crucial to cancer test,HYDERABAD: Sindh health department has not yet provided PET Scan or Cyclotron machine for carrying out essential...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh health department has not yet provided PET Scan or Cyclotron machine for carrying out essential cancer tests to Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) Hyderabad branch even though health facility had made the request way back in April 2021.
The machine for positron emission tomography (PET) scan is used for determining level and spread of malignant cells in a cancer patient’s body. Oncology patients, mostly from lower Sindh region, had to approach Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) or Sindh Institute of Urology Transplantation (SIUT) in Karachi to have the test done.
Both the Sindh government health facilities are conducting the scan but given increasing load of patients every individual have to wait for several weeks for his or her turn, triggering frenetic attempts by patients’ attendants to jump the queue.
Then LUH medical superintendent had submitted to the health department a proposal for the establishment of an advanced medical facility for cancer diagnostic and treatment in Hyderabad in April 2021.
The proposal was forwarded by then secretary health Dr Kazim Hussain Jatoi (presently secretary finance) to health minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho who was to seek its approval from Sindh chief minister through a summary.
According to the summary, the MS had proposed the facility where PET CT/Cyclotron and linear accelerator equipment could be provided at a cost of Rs910 million or Rs855m each for two pieces. The cost must have escalated since then because the machines have not yet been provided.
On her part, Dr Pechuho had approved installation of Rs910m worth PET Scan machine in the first phase in 2021-22 and the second machine in 2022-23. However, since then two fiscal years have passed and the third fiscal year, in a row, is nearing closure but no headway has been made in this regard.
Caretaker health minister Dr Saad Niaz remained unaware of the proposal and he suggested that “before getting the machine the hospital must have a good trained radiologist”. And Dr Saad’s suggestion was not entirely wrong given past experiences of (mis)handling such expensive machines like angiography in the hospital.
LUH caters to patients from entire lower Sindh including Tharparkar. Even patients from upper Sindh districts end up in LUH’s city and Jamshoro branches. Given healthcare needs of such a huge load of patients, the hospital administration was said to have prepared a list of machines and equipment needed for different departments of the hospital and share it with health department in 2023 but no major progress was seen on the issue during caretaker regime’s tenure.
A conflict arose between outgoing caretaker Sindh chief minister Justice (retired) Maqbool Baqar and caretaker health minister Dr Saad Niaz as the latter complained of being cornered by the former. Secretary health Mansoor Abbas had also written a letter to Sindh chief secretary against the minister in January. Resultantly, health facilities’ working was affected. Mansoor did not respond to repeated calls this correspondent made to him to seek his comment on present status of the April 2021 summary.
“I think PET Scan is all the more important for LUH so that we can at least curtail financial cost of a cancer patient,” said a senior oncologist Dr Mohammad Ali Memon.
Dr Memon had retired from federal government’s National institute of Medicine and Radiotherapy (NIMRA), Jamshoro, after serving as oncologist.
According to him, after a PET Scan was done the oncologist rarely went for other tests like ultrasound, memo graph etc. “Rs125,000 is being charged for a PET Scan in Karachi’s top private hospital while another hospital is demanding Rs85,000 per patient,” he said. He was of the view that after adding other costs of cancer treatment the total cost came to a million rupees or more.
Surgeon Dr Arshad Abro believed that since several patients were advised to have this test done if the facility was made available here it would reduce logistical cost of patients considerably.
“All potential cancer patients’ tests can be handled through these two machines,” he informed and said that he was also trying to make sure that the machines were made available in LUH.
He believed that as per safe estimates around 100 patients were referred to Karachi for this test. He was making another push through the MS to request health department to requisition the machine, he said.
Dr Memon said that PET facility must be ensured at all cost in LUH so that patients from Hyderabad, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot and Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Benazirabad and Sanghar patients could benefit from the facility.

12,"Growers’ board claims urea firms, dealers made up to Rs70bn profit over last six months","Hopes new govt will ensure effective control on price, supplies","HYDERABAD: The Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) which met here on Sunday, has urged the incoming federal and Sindh governments to control prices of farm inputs and rationalise prices of agricultural commodities commensurate with cost of input.   
The meeting, chaired by Syed Mahmood Nawaz Shah, expressed the hope that lawmakers would accord priority to agriculture sector and create an environment where it could perform to its optimum level.
The meeting discussed many issues highlighting the challenges being faced by this sector. 
The board also expressed its concern over irregularities in the fertiliser trading, and noted that urea was the prime example as it was the largely used fertiliser in the country.

Hopes new govt will ensure effective control on price, supplies

SAB members told the meeting that every other month urea price had been going up, pointing out that over the last 12 months alone, the price increased from Rs2,900 per bag to Rs4,649.
The meeting said it was condemnable that even at this increased rate, the commodity was not being made available to growers at the minimum retail price.
It noted that when companies increased prices overnight, inventory with companies and dealers would become huge and get them profits in billions. Still, it added, urea was sold at a price over and above the maximum retail price.
According to SAB estimate, Rs60bn to 70b had been made by profiteers in the sale of urea to growers over the last six months alone.
“There seems to be a willful smoke screen created to plunder,” the meeting claimed, and urged government to bring order to the urea business.
In addition to urea, the rates of DAP, potash, pesticides, fuel and other nutrients continued to rise, in some cases on a daily basis without any checks and balances. 
The meeting condemned this lack of governance, and said this was hurting growers and consumers of farm produce, besides the economy.
The meeting recommended that efficiency should be created in seed eco-system. It wondered that it was about one year now that no meeting of the Provincial Seed Council had been held although it was supposed to be held regularly.
The meeting noted that new seed registration was slow and, therefore, growers were left with no other option but to continue using obsolete or adulterated seeds.
It also noted that biotechnology was being completely ignored. It urged that with a strong regulatory regime, Pakistan should embark on use of biotechnology in seeds and encourage private sector to conduct research to help enhance availability of quality seeds that could resist climate change effects and drought as well as pest and disease.
