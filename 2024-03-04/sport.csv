Ridden by jockey Aamir Pervez, who recorded his eighth triumph in the country’s premier classic term race for four-year-old thoroughbreds, the A.B. Malik-trained Jim And Tonic clocked 32 3/5 seconds over the 2400m distance — just two fraction short of the record time for the Derby — and was followed by Farhan King, Spartacus and Last Emperor in making the frame in the race which featured 14 runners.
Earlier, rank outsider Dil Awaiz powered to a victory over two-lengths in the Nat­ional Breeders Cup classic, the most important term race for three-year-old thoroughbreds.

1,Vinicius scores twice as Real fight back to draw at Valencia,VALENCIA: Vinicius Jr scored a brace to help Real Madrid fight back from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at...,"VALENCIA: Vinicius Jr scored a brace to help Real Madrid fight back from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Valencia in an ill-tempered La Liga clash on Saturday, as the Brazil winger returned to a stadium where he was racially abused last year.
The 23-year-old Brazilian stared defiantly at the Mestalla crowd several times, with the local fans jeering and whistling his every touch of the ball.
The hosts led 2-0 after just half an hour as striker Hugo Duro and Roman Yaremchuk deservedly put Valencia in the lead.
Real’s reaction came five minutes into first half injury time with Vinicius’ first goal celebrating with his fist raised in the air in front of Valencias supporters.
Vinicius then equalised with 14 minutes to play and this time celebrated by putting his hands behind his ears.
Real pushed for a winner as Diakhaby attempted to clear but his  right leg was trapped under Tchouameni in the 89th minute and the Valencia defender suffered a serious leg injury.
Diakhaby, 27, was stretchered off from the pitch and players from both teams were visibly shaken.
After  the incident, the referee added seven minutes of injury time. Almost two  further minutes had been played when England’s Jude Bellingham thought he had  claimed three points.
Referee Manzano refused to allow the goal as he had blown the whistle during Brahim Diaz’s would-be assist.
A disgruntled Bellingham went to the referee to complain and was shown a straight red card.
Earlier, a reshuffled Real Sociedad went down to a fourth defeat in  their last five matches with a 3-2 loss to Sevilla.
The Basques were undone by Moroccan striker  Youssef En-Nesyri, who bagged a brace in two minutes early in the game  before Sergio Ramos got the third on 65 minutes.
An Andre Silva  penalty deep into first-half injury time gave the visitors hope but  Brais Mendez’s consolation in the second minute of added time was not  enough.
Meanwhile, Rayo Vallecano and Cadiz played out a 1-1 draw while the clash between Las Palmas and Getafe also ended in a 3-3 stalemate.

The 24-year-old 400 hurdles specialist made it look effortless, leading from the gun to clock 49.17 seconds and beat the previous mark of 49.24 she set two weeks ago at the Dutch national championships.
“It was such a strong race, I knew I had to go out fast. My coach said to me ‘You can run faster’, but to be honest I just wanted to win,” said Bol, gold medallist in the 400m hurdles and 4x400m relay at the outdoor world championships last year in Budapest.
Alexander Doom of Belgium overtook Norway’s Karsten Warholm, a triple world champion in the 400 hurdles, over the final few metres to win the men’s 400 in 45.25. Warholm crossed in 45.34 for silver.
Julien Alfred of Saint Lucia ran 6.98 — quickest in the world this season — to win the women’s 60, edging Ewa Swoboda of Poland by two-hundreds of a second.
The 26-year-old Kerr, who raced in rose-coloured glasses, clocked 7:42.98 seconds, surging past Ethiopia’s Selemon Barega with 100 metres to go in another world-beating achievement amid a remarkable few months.
American Yared Nuguse took silver in 7:43.59 while Barega faded to third.
Kerr, who won the world outdoor 1,500 title in Budapest last year and three weeks ago broke Mo Farah’s indoor two miles world record in New York, high-fived fans sitting trackside during an exuberant victory lap.
“I think I burned more energy celebrating than I did in the race,” said Kerr, who chose to race the 3,000 over the 1,500 to work on his strength.
“These competitions are so important. I’ve come to championships before not ready to take a real swing at it and I feel like I let the UK audience down a little bit in the way that I’ve performed.
“So this was really important for me to come here, ready to go and really execute.”
British team-mate Molly Caudery cleared 4.80 metres to win the women’s pole vault, edging New Zealand’s Eliza McCartney whose best mark was also 4.80 but with more foul jumps.
“I dreamed of (winning), I wasn’t sure if it would come true or not,” Caudery said.  “There was six girls over 4.80 coming into (the competition), so I knew it was going to be a fight.”
Caudery’s gold was a first global medal for the 23-year-old who nearly severed a finger lifting weights in 2021 and required three surgeries to re-attach the digit, and then was sidelined for nine months after two Achilles tendon surgeries.
The pole vault competition was paused briefly after Margot Chevrier of France suffered a broken ankle.
American Grant Holloway added another world title to his glittering resume in winning the men’s 60 hurdles in 7.31 seconds, just shy of the world record 7.29 he ran two weeks ago.
“I had good fun out here and achieved what I wanted to,” said Holloway, who has won 76 consecutive races, including qualifying rounds, and owns three world and now two world indoor gold medals.  “It wasn’t a record but that’s OK. It was my fifth world title so I’m happy to keep racking them up.”
American Elle St. Pierre sprinted past multi-world champion Gudaf Tsegay of Ethiopia with 50 metres remaining to win the women’s 3,000m in 8:20.87. Tsegay, the reigning world outdoor champion in the 10,000, crossed in 8:21.13 for silver.
Burkina Faso’s Hugues Fabrice Zango won the men’s triple jump with a  best of 17.53m on his fifth attempt ahead of Yasser Mohamma Triki of  Algeria (17.35m) and Portugal’s Tiago Pereira (17.08).

Ethiopia’s Sutume Asefa Kebede won the women’s race ahead of Kenya’s defending champion Rose­m­ary Wanjiru in 2:15:55, also bettering the best previous women’s time over the course from Shinjuku to the Imperial Palace.
Kipruto pulled clear of Timothy Kiplagat over the last few kilometres and finished 39 seconds ahead of his compatriot to add the Tokyo title to those he won in Boston in 2021 and Chicago in 2022.
The 32-year-old’s time was almost two minutes better than his previous personal best and made him the fifth-fastest marathon runner of all time in events approved by World Athletics.
Vincent Kipkemoi Nget­ich finished third in 2:04:18 to give Kenya a podium sweep, with Ethiopians Hailemaryam Kiros and Tsegaye Getachew in fourth and fifth places. Kipchoge finished 10th. 
Kebede and Wanjiru had been in the leading group throughout the women’s race, but at the 37km mark the Ethiopian upped her pace to pull clear of her rivals and claim her first major marathon title by 19 seconds.
Her time bettered Brigid Kosgei’s 2022 women’s course record of 2:16:02 and took more than two minutes off her previous personal best time of 2:18:12.

The three points came at the U-Power Stadium thanks to goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini and Romelu Lukaku towards the end of the first half before Paulo Dybala’s stunning free-kick in the 63rd minute and a late Leandro Paredes penalty.
Andrea Carboni netted a fine consolation goal for 11th-placed Monza with a long-range rocket in the 87th minute of Roma’s sixth win in seven league fixtures since De Rossi replaced Jose Mourinho in January.
Roma are fifth, one point behind Bologna who sit in the final Champions League spot.
Earlier, bottom team Salernitana held Udinese to a 1-1 draw, while seventh-placed Fiorentina’s bid for European football stumbled with a goalless draw against 10-man Torino.

Zaman Golf Championship with a stunning late charge at the Lahore Gymkhana Golf Course here on Sunday.
Having started the final round two shots behind Pakistan number one Shabbir Iqbal, Ahmed left his rivals trailing in his wake with a remarkable show starting from the par-5 16th hole.
Ahmed had landed his second shot on the green, some 25 feet away from the hole. With the wind backing him, he went for it and landed an eagle to surge into the lead before finishing off with consecutive birdies to finish with a three-under 69 and an overall eight-under 280.
Overnight leader Shabbir (73) couldn’t respond to Ahmed’s inspired putting and finished two strokes behind, one stroke ahead of Minhaj Maqsood Warriach (70). Mohammad Nazir, who was Shabbir’s closest challenger at the start of the last 18 holes, was a further shot adrift after carding 74.
Mohammad Alam (73) ended in fifth on 285, three ahead of Moha­mmad Zubair.

By lifting the title, the 25-year-old Frenchman became only the third player in the professional era to win his first six tour-level finals, matching the achievement of Latvia’s Ernests Gulbis and Slovakia’s Martin Klizan.
“I really don’t know, but I have a good statistic,” Humbert said about his ability to rise to the occasion in title clashes.  “I have a really good team around me.”
The in-form Marseille champion edged a tight opening set when seventh seed Bublik fired a double fault in the 10th game as he chanced his arm and attempted a big second serve in a desperate bid to hold.
Left-hander Humbert, who took out top seed and Australian Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev in the semi-final, showcased his superb defensive skills to earn a chance to break in the next set and pounced for a 3-1 lead when Bublik found the net.
He unleashed a monster forehand to go 5-2 ahead before a smiling Bublik looked to throw a spanner in the works by riding a wave of support from the Centre Court crowd.
But Humbert held his nerve two games later as he saved a breakpoint and wrapped up the match on his second championship point with a passing winner.

11,HBL PSL 2024: Ton-up Usman leads rampant Sultans into playoffs,"Bludgeoning the Karachi bowlers for his second PSL century, Usman reminded what Pakistan missed out on as he took the Sultans to a 20-run victory and into the playoffs.","

KARACHI: Multan Sultans batter Usman Khan hits out during his century in the HBL Pakistan Super League match against Karachi Kings at the National Stadium on Sunday.—Tahir Jamal/White Star

 
KARACHI: On a crisp, cold night here at the National Bank Stadium on Sunday, the crowds had come in decent numbers and the upbeat, weekend mood was audible with their continuous chanting.
It wasn’t a player from home team Karachi Kings who displayed the fireworks though. It was Multan Sultans batter Usman Khan.
Dejected by the state of affairs in Pakistan, Usman had moved to the United Arab Emirates a few years ago, and recently became eligible to play for the emirate’s national side.  Bludgeoning the Karachi bowlers for his second HBL Pakistan Super League century, Usman reminded what Pakistan missed out on as he took the Sultans to a 20-run victory and into the playoffs.
Usman’s onslaught left Karachi’s fate hanging as the team stuck outside of the play-off places in the franchise league’s standings. Multan, meanwhile, consolidated their position at the top of the table.
After Multan had elected to bat first, it was all about Usman’s dynamism with the bat. Coming in at first drop, Usman smashed an unbeaten 106 off 59 — a knock featuring 10 fours and five sixes — almost single handedly boosting Multan to 189-3.
The right-hander arri­v­ed at the crease after Multan had lost opener Reeza Hendricks early and took the attack on the Karachi bowlers while his captain Rizwan related the strike on the other end.
After Hendricks’ upper cut off Blessing Muzar­abani had ended up into the hands of Mir Hamza at deep third man in the second over, a cut-shot masterclass by Usman took Multan past 50 on the final ball of the powerplay.
The right-hander slashed Hasan Ali and Muzara­bani’s pace through the square region on more than one occasion and was equally good against Mohammad Nawaz’s spin.
Usman went big for the first time in his knock when he danced down the ground to lift Nawaz over extra-cover for a handsome six before Rizwan played an inside-out drive to add four more as Multan reached 87-1 at halfway stage.
Usman brought up his half century in 32 balls after cutting Hasan for another boundary in the 12th over.
He punished a half-tracker by Shoaib Malik in the next over for a huge six over deep midwicket before Rizwan lifted Muzarabani over mid-on for four more to bring up the 100-run partnership between the pair.
Usman hit spinner Zahid Mahmood high and long in the stands and added a four to his knock in the 15th over.
Rizwan (58 off 44) crossed the 50-run mark on 40 balls after hitting Hasan for two fours in the next over before giving his wicket to Muzarabani.
Iftikhar Ahmed received a rousing welcome as Chacha, Chacha echoed from the stands. But to the  spectators’ disappointment, he holed Hasan out to Shan at deep midwicket.
Usman brought up his 100 with a pull for six against Hamza in the final over, jumping in the air to celebrate as the crowd roared for him.
Karachi lost opener Tim Seifert early on with the New Zealander run out in the second over and they found themselves deeper in trouble when Chris Jordan — playing his first match this season — found a genuine nick off James Vince’s bat.
But the incoming Malik and Kings’ skipper Shan Masood — who had hit five fours by then — took the team to 53-2 by the end of the powerplay.
Usama Mir missed out on the opportunity to run Shan out following a confusion between him and Malik in the seventh over.
The leg-spinner, however, bounced back by cleaning up Shan in the ninth over as the left-hander attempted a big slog-sweep before Karachi posted 79-3 at halfway stage.
Malik became Khushdil Shah’s victim as the veteran holed the spinner out to Jordan at long-on.
Usama wrapped up his four overs with Leus du Plooy’s wicket in the 13th over as the left-hander found Rizwan at cover before Karachi brought up their 100.
Irfan Khan Niazi smashed chinaman bowler Faisal Akram through the off-side for two boundaries before bludgeoning the left-armer for a flat six over midwicket in the 14th over.
Pacer David Willey gave away only three runs in the next over with Karachi needing 71 off 30 and their main batters back in the hut.
And when Willey went on to dismiss Irfan in the 17th over, it was effectively all over for Karachi. There were a few lusty blows by Mohammad Nawaz and Hasan Ali after Irfan’s departure, but the duo’s efforts were for nothing but damage control.

12,Foden double fires City to comeback win against United,Foden arrowed a sublime effort into the top corner in the 56th minute and the England forward then produced a composed finish with 10 minutes of normal time remaining.,"MANCHESTER: Phil Foden kept Manchester City’s Premier League title challenge on track with a superb second-half double as his side hit back to clinch a 3-1 home victory over Manchester United on Sunday. 
Marcus Rashford’s eighth-minute thunderbolt gave United the lead against the run of play and it looked like the visitors might put a dent in City’s hopes of a fourth successive crown. 
But Pep Guardiola’s side rem­ained patient, dominated possession and were eventually rewa­rded with Foden again proving how indispensable he is for City. 
Foden arrowed a sublime effort into the top corner in the 56th minute and the England forward then produced a composed finish with 10 minutes of normal time remaining. 
Erling Haaland, who missed a golden first-half chance, secured the points with a late strike. 
Reigning champions City, whose unbeaten run in all competitions now stands at 19, moved to 62 points, one behind leaders Liverpool who they visit next weekend. United remain in sixth place with 44 points. 
Rashford’s bolt from the blue might have floored lesser sides but Erik Ten Hag’s United could have few complaints at the way City turned things around. 
City had 74% possession and 27 efforts on goal compared to United’s three but it was Foden who found the key to the lock. 
He was given a standing ovation as he walked off after taking a knock in stoppage time — City’s fans in buoyant mood at keeping the pressure right on Liverpool and Arsenal. 
Earlier, Bournemouth pushed struggling Burnley closer to relegation from the Premier League with a 2-0 win at Turf Moor. 
Andoni Iraola’s side inflicted Burnley’s 20th defeat in 27 league games this season thanks to Justin Kluivert’s early goal and Antoine Semenyo’s strike in the closing minutes. 
Bournemouth had not won a game since Boxing Day and the victory moved them up to 31 points to sit 13th, 11 points clear of the relegation zone. 
Burnley remain second-bottom after a fourth straight loss, 11 points from the safety zone with 11 games left. The defeat also marked the first time they had lost 11 league matches at home in a season. 
In Saturday’s late game, fourth-placed Aston Villa held off a spirited second-half comeback from Luton Town to win 3-2 and move to 55 points from 27 matches. 
Ollie Watkins struck twice for Villa in the first 38 minutes to take his tally for the season to 21. 
Luton’s prowess from set-pieces looked to have salvaged a point as goals from Tahith Chong and Carlton Morris levelled. 
But  substitute Lucas Digne headed in Moussa Diaby’s cross at the back post in the  89th minute to keep his side in the hunt for Champions League football next season.

13,"Bangladesh, Sri Lanka look to fine-tune World Cup preparations",SYLHET: Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said on Sunday he wanted his team to use the three-match Twenty20...,"SYLHET: Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said on Sunday he wanted his team to use the three-match Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka to perfect the format ahead of the World Cup in June.
The series, which opens Monday in Sylhet, marks the start of Sri Lanka’s month-long tour of Bangladesh, which also includes three One-day Internationals and two Tests.
Najmul said it was critical to  “play as a team”, noting that big wins last year were because  “everyone contributed”.
Bangladesh have never defeated Sri Lanka in a Twenty20 series.
Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood said he was expecting a  “very competitive series between two good sides”.
Bangladesh defeated world champions England 3-0 at home in 2023, and also won series against Ireland and Afghanistan, before drawing a three-match series 1-1 against New Zealand.
Najmul said he wanted to keep the momentum going into the World Cup, hosted this year by the United States and the West Indies.
“Last year, we did well in T20s, and I think we have improved in T20s,” Najmul told reporters. “If we can improve... then hopefully we will be able to compete with anyone in any condition.”
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are both in Group D for the World Cup, along with South Africa, Nepal and the Netherlands.
“It is very important that we play eight or 11 matches before going to the World Cup,” Najmul said. “If we take these matches... and decide how we want to play in the World Cup, then it will be easy to plan.”
The World Cup is a key focus of Sri Lanka too.
“Obviously, we’re now in the build-up to what is an important competition in the World Cup,” Silverwood said  “What we have to do... is concentrate on what’s in front of us and remember what we’re aiming for.”
The second and third T20 matches will be held on March 6 and 9, both also at Sylhet.

WELLINGTON: Austr­alia captain Pat Cummins heaped praise on team-mates Nathan Lyon and Cameron Green on Sunday for match-winning performances as his side secured a 172-run triumph over New Zealand in the first Test. 
Lyon spun the visitors to victory in the morning session on day four in Welli­ngton, taking six wickets as New Zealand crumbled to 196 all out. 
New Zealand lost their last seven wickets before lunch for 70 runs, with four falling to off-spinner Lyon, who finished with figures of 6-65 off 27 overs and 10-108 in the match. 
The 36-year-old capitalised on spin-friendly Basin Reserve conditions and some meek batting from New Zealand, who began the day on 111-3 needing an unlikely 258 more runs to win. 
Green’s career-high unbeaten 174 on day one rescued Australia from 89-4, having been put into bat, to reach 383 and set up a decisive 204-run first-innings lead. 
It gave Green the nod over Lyon as man-of-the-match and Cummins said that was a fair outcome. 
“Cam was amazing, he was really the difference in the end,” Cummins said. “I thought the way he went about it, with that intent, really put the pressure back on the bowlers on day one. There was as much bounce as I’ve seen in any wicket for a long time but thankfully it spun which, with Nathan in our side, is always a pretty good thing.” 
New Zealand pace bowler Will O’Rourke is a doubt for the second and final Test starting in Christchurch on Friday after leaving the field with a tight hamstring on day three. 
Captain Tim Southee said he wouldn’t rule out a shock recall for veteran pace bowler Neil Wagner, who retired last week. 
The 37-year-old had been named in New Zealand’s squad, but tearfully announced his retirement after being left out of the first Test side, ending a 64-Test, 260-wicket career. 
Southee ruled out calling up Trent Boult because he has only been playing white ball cricket of late, but was less adamant when asked about Wagner. 
“Obviously the Test match has only just finished so we’ll see how Will scrubs up and we’ll go from there,” Southee said. 
Cummins said Australia would be prepared if Wagner returned.  
“It’d be the world’s shortest retirement,” he said of the short-ball specialist. “It’d be good to see his high energy.” 
Southee and batsman Kane Williamson will both play their 100th Test at Hagley Oval in Christchurch. 
The defeat leaves New Zealand with only one win in 24 Tests against their neighbours this century. 
“Like every game, we’ll reflect and look at ways that we can be better in the next one,” said Southee. “We’ll debrief and obviously move to a different ground, a different surface, a ground we’ve had a lot of success at.” 
Southee hailed Glenn Phillips after the all-rounder top scored with 71 in the first innings and claimed career-best figures of 5-45 with his part-time off-spin as Australia were dismissed for 164 in the second. 
“Glenn’s still new to Test cricket and new to bowling, and he’s doing a great job,” Southee said of the 27-year-old. 
Phillips’s success only had Australians licking their lips at what Lyon, a far more experienced and accomplished slow bowler, could do on the same track. 
Lyon needed a change of ends to really hit his mark on Sunday but once he did, the 36-year-old tore the heart out of the New Zealand batting order. 
The capitulation began in the seventh over when Lyon claimed the key wicket of Rachin Ravindra for 59. 
Ravindra had only added three to his overnight score when he failed to keep a cut shot down and was caught by Green at point. 
Tom Blundell was caught close in by Travis Head without scoring in the same over and Glenn Phillips was trapped leg before by Lyon for one soon afterwards, to expose the tail. 
Daryl Mitchell and Scott Kuggeleijn offered some resistance for the seventh wicket but Green dismissed the latter for 26, caught by wicket-keeper, Alex Carey and Matt Henry fell for 14, caught at slip by Steve Smith off Josh Hazlewood. 
Southee became Lyon’s sixth victim before Hazlewood who hammered the final nail into New Zealand’s coffin, however, the ever-reliable paceman sending down a steepling delivery that Mitchell (38) only managed to spoon back to him for the simplest of caught-and-bowled dismissals.
