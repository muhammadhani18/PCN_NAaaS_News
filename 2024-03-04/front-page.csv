• Younger Sharif makes lofty promises, vows widespread reform to lead country out of crises
• PTI leader rejects ‘rigged elections’ and ‘incomplete house’, says party will remain in protest mode
ISLAMABAD: PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday secured the support of 201 lawmakers from multiple parties to become prime minister for a second time in a one-sided contest, boycotted by former allies JUI-F and Akhtar Mengal’s BNP-M.
Mr Sharif is expected to take oath of office in a ceremony at the Presidency today (Monday) after the convening of the first regular session of the NA, set to be held at 11am. The sole agenda for this ‘novel’ session would be felicitations for the PM-elect.
His opponent was Omar Ayub, supported by the Sunni Ittehad Council after its merger with the PTI, who managed to secure 92 votes in the lower house of parliament, which has a total strength of 336. However, only 305 lawmakers have taken oath so far.
Eight lawmakers of the JUI-F led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman skipped the session whereas BNP-M President Akhtar Mengal, who chose to sit on the opposition benches, did not poll his vote despite a request from PTI-backed Amir Dogar, who is the chief whip of the opposition party.
The fourth sitting of the new National Assembly was no different from previous days, as when pandemonium prevailed during proceedings, particularly due to noisy protests by PTI-backed lawmakers demonstrating against alleged rigging in the Feb 8 elections.
At one point, there was a fear of a physical confrontation between PML-N and PTI-SIC lawmakers who surrounded the speaker’s chair. PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat also got into an argument with their opponents, forcing the speaker to intervene and prevent the altercation from escalating.
Victory speech
PM-elect Shehbaz Sharif delivered a lengthy speech, which seemingly prompted his opponent Omar Ayub to do the same; the former spoke for over an hour while the latter took nearly two.
In his remarks, Mr Sharif extended an olive branch to the PTI to jointly steer the country through multiple problems, but the PTI did not appear so keen. “Let us sit together to change the fate of Pakistan. I request [the opposition] to think with a cool mind after the protest?” Shehbaz Sharif said as he stressed the need for ‘a charter of reconciliation’.
During his speech, the PM-elect promised women empowerment, eradication of militants through the National Action Plan, and reforms in the IT sector, prisons, and the justice system. He also promised scholarships on merit and an efficient public transport system as well as energy reforms. He said though the challenges faced by Pakistan were aplenty, they were not insurmountable.
Deficit of Rs700bn
As per estimates, the revenues stand at Rs12,300 billion and after the release of the NFC award to the province, the federal government is left with only Rs7,300 billion, out of which Rs8,000 billion are spent on debt servicing, leaving the country with a deficit of Rs700 billion, the PM-elect said.
He said Pakistan had sought Rs80,000 billion in external, internal and private debts in the past, adding that the issue required “reforms in the system and various sectors”.
The younger Sharif sibling also mentioned the power sector, saying this alone was burdened with a circular debt of Rs2,300 billion and unrecovered amounts.
Mr Sharif said about 500,000 students would be imparted the latest training and artificial intelligence and IT exports would be focused on. He said high achievers would be provided with scholarships in the world’s renowned educational institutions. The elder Sharif pledged reforms in the agri sector and said farmers would be provided direct subsidies on fertilisers. Similarly, he also promised solar tube wells for farmers as well as imported seeds. He also vowed to make the public transport network better.
The PM-elect underlined the need for a speedy justice system through required reforms in consultations with all stakeholders.
He also announced to completely implement the National Action Plan to end terrorism. He also promised equal rights for women and minorities.
‘Incomplete’ house
Runner-up Omar Ayub rejected the election in his long-winded speech, saying the house was incomplete without the 23 reserved seats of the SIC. He demanded a judicial inquiry into the May 9 incidents.
He claimed the general elections were rigged; otherwise, the PTI would have bagged 180 seats instead of 91. “In that way, we would have 247 seats,” he claimed and called the upcoming government “PDM-2” – a reference to the coalition government which ruled the country for 16 months after the ouster of the PTI government.
He said his party would remain in the ‘protest mode’ unless the party’s founder Imran Khan became the prime minister of the country. He recalled that all cases made against Imran Khan and other party leaders were fake and must be withdrawn.
He said PTI was first deprived of its election symbol (bat), its leaders and workers faced imprisonment, raids, police batons, torture and even killings, “Our 14 workers were killed on May 9 for which Shehbaz Sharif, ex-chief minister Punjab Mohsin Naqvi and IG Punjab are responsible,” he claimed and mentioned their name during his speech. Mr Ayub recalled actions against media persons, like the late Arshad Sharif, Asad Toor and Imran Riaz.
At the outset, ex-Balochistan CM Jam Kamal took oath as an MNA, increasing the total number of NA members to 305.

1,"JUI-F to abstain, MQM-P sets conditions for presidential vote","Fazl expresses ""personal preference"" for Achakzai over Zardari; Farooq Sattar seeks answers on ""misuse of funds""."," 

KARACHI: JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman addresses a press conference after a meeting of the party’s general council, in Korangi, on Sunday.—Facebook / juipakofficial

KARACHI: It seems that Asif Ali Zardari does not command the same popularity among his allies as he did when first elected president in 2008, with JUI-F opting to abstain from voting in the presidential election, while MQM-P has declared they will present their demands if approached by the PPP for votes.
JUI-F Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, while addressing a press conference in Karachi on Sunday, made it clear that his party would abstain from voting in the presidential elections, and he conveyed this stance to all leaders of the ruling alliance who had recently sought his support.
Asked about the prospects of the upco­ming presidential elections, he expressed support for the opposition candidate Meh­mood Khan Achakzai over the PPP’s Mr Zar­dari but clarified that it was “a personal wish” and not the party’s decision.
 


“I personally want to vote Achakzai Sb [in the presidential election],” Maulana said. “But this is my wish and not the party’s decision. If the party decides to abstain from the voting, my wish doesn’t matter. The party decision is supreme over personal wishes.”

Fazl expresses ‘personal preference’ for Achakzai over Zardari; Farooq Sattar seeks answers on ‘misuse of funds’

 
 

Dashing the hopes of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led ruling alliance, JUI-F chief ruled out all possibilities of joining the treasury benches and insisted to be a part of the opposition in the parliament while giving hint to launch a “countrywide protest campaign” against the “rigged” elections.
Reiterating his stance on the Feb 8 elections, he accused the establishment of “stealing and managing” the mandate of the people of Pakistan, who, he claimed, were betrayed once again in 2024, just as in 2018.
“Our friends [leaders or PML-N and PPP] approached us and held meetings,” he replied to a question about results of his recent meetings with the leaders of the parties which are part of the ruling alliance.
“We met them, gave them due respect and argued our case before them. I am sure that they would be convinced now and won’t ask us again [to join the government]. We would be sitting on opposition benches [in the parliament] and no one should have any doubt about this.”
While describing the Feb 8 elections in general “rigged and controversial,” he specifically mentioned provincial assemblies in Sindh and Balochistan where the mandate was “bought” spending huge amount of money. In both provinces, the PPP which emerged as majority party, has recently managed to get its nominees elected as chief ministers and set up its government.
“This doesn’t mean that we are satisfied with the election results in KP or other parts of the country,” said Maulana when asked about his opinion on elections in other provinces. “The establishment came up with a weird plan distributing mandate on its own ignoring people’s will and votes. We were against this plan and weren’t part of this sale purchase game so we lost the elections.”
To a question about the possibility of a “grand alliance” of opposition parties in the parliament, the JUI-F chief said that it would be too early to suggest any such partnership in the near future.
Apart from “local elements”, Maulana was sure that the defeat suffered by his party in the recent elections had also some “international factors” which made “foreign powers angry” on JUI-F.
“How can you ignore the role of international powers [in the elections] who were obviously not happy over my meetings with leaders of Hamas to show solidarity with the people of Palestine and condemn Israeli atrocities,” he said.
“Then I met the leaders of Afghanistan where the US has suffered humiliating defeat and Islamic Emirate has come into power. Though my meetings with Afghan leaders was meant to bring the two countries closer and peace in the region, it wasn’t felt good by the international powers. So they put our establishment under pressure and then came the results of the elections.”
MQM-P to present demands
Separately, MQM-P senior leader Dr Farooq Sattar said that there have been no discussions with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) regarding the upcoming presidential elections.
While talking to media, Dr Sattar said that if the PPP is interested in talks, “we are not against them and our doors are open”.
He emphasised that if they do reach out, MQM-P will present their demands and seek answers.
He stressed the need to seek answers regarding the apparent misuse of billions of rupees received in the budget.
“We will seek answers about their behaviour towards MQM-P and the people of Sindh, particularly in terms of the allocation and utilisation of budgetary funds,” he said.
He said that MQM-P would like to know about Mr Zardari’s future plans.
“We want to know how, as president, Mr Zardari would play his role in creating harmony among different factions within the provinces.”

2,PTI unveils results of party polls ‘held on SC guidelines’,"Barrister Gohar and Omar Ayub elected party chairman, secretary general unopposed, respectively.","ISLAMABAD: The PTI has officially announced the results of its intra-party polls, declaring that Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Omar Ayub Khan have been elected unopposed as the chairman and secretary general of the party, respectively, in elections held as per Supreme Court guidelines.
In Balochistan, however, where elections were held for the provincial chapter chief on Sunday, the panel of Dawood Shah, who had the backing of PTI founder Imran Khan, prevailed over Amin Khan Jogezai and Dr Munir Ahmed Baloch.
 
 

According to the party’s provincial election commissioner, Dawood Usmankheil, three panels contested the intra-party election for PTI’s Balochistan president.
Mr Shah, a local leader from Quetta, was elected the PTI Balochistan president after securing 445 votes, while Dr Baloch, the former provincial president, remained second with 435 votes. Mr Jogezai received only 57 votes.
According to Mr Usmankheil, registered party voters cast their votes in the elections.
There were 940 registered votes, and the turnout was 100 per cent. Three votes were rejected.
PTI workers see Dr Baloch’s defeat as an upset, as he was the local favourite.
The other three provincial chapters heads have already been elected unopposed.
Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ali Amin Gandapur and Haleem Adil Sheikh will be the presidents for the party’s Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh chapters, respectively.
All winners were nominated and backed by the incarcerated PTI founder, and their victory was guaranteed anyway. However, to meet ECP’s requirement and avoid any unopposed election, rival panels also submitted nomination papers.
However, the contesting candidates later withdrew their nomination papers, paving the way for the unopposed wins of all of Mr Khan’s nominees.
Polls ‘in line with SC guidelines’
In Islamabad, PTI’s Federal Election Commissioner Raoof Hasan formally announced the results during a press conference on Sunday.
 
 

Mr Hasan claimed that intra-party elections were held for the third time as per the Supreme Court’s guidelines.
Ashraf Jabbar and Dr Muhammad Aslam, who voluntarily withdrew their nomination papers as chairman candidates and returning officers for the election of chairman and secretary general, Ayesha Khalid and Amina Ali, respectively, were also present on the occasion.
Mr Hasan said four candidates had filed nomination papers for the PTI chairman post, three of whom were accepted and one rejected.
However, the other three candidates later withdrew their nominations, and Barrister Gohar was elected the chairman unopposed.
Mr Ayub, who was also part of Barrister Gohar’s panel, was nominated by the PTI founder.
He thanked Mr Jabbar and Dr Aslam, who “voluntarily withdrew” their nomination papers in favour of Mr Gohar “in the party’s interest” and to maintain harmony and unity.
Mr Hasan added that nomination papers of Naveed Anjum Khan were rejected because he contested the general election against a PTI-backed independent candidate.
Therefore, his party membership was cancelled by the district president on February 11.

3,Yousuf Gilani among 21 nominees for by-polls on six Senate seats,"Ex-PM being tipped as next chairman of upper house; no candidate from PML-N, MQM submits papers.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peo­ples Party leader Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani has submitted nomination papers to contest the Senate election and to regain his own seat from Islamabad that fell vacant following his victory as an MNA in the Feb 8 general elections.
Mr Gilani will be facing Chaudhry Ilyas Mehrban of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) in a one-on-one Senate contest for which polling will be held in the National Assembly on March 14.
 
 

As the deadline set by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for submission of nomination papers ended on Sunday, a total of 19 other candidates from different political parties filed their papers for the five other Senate seats — three from Balochistan and two from Sindh — which have fallen vacant after the election of the members of the upper house of parliament to the National and provincial assemblies.
These seats have fallen vacant under Article 223 of the Cons­titution which clearly bars double membership. Under sub-section 4 of the Article, if a member of either house of the parliament or of a provincial assembly becomes a candidate for a second seat, which he may not hold concurrently with his first seat, then his first seat becomes vacant as soon as he is elected to the second seat.

Ex-PM being tipped as next chairman of upper house; no candidate from PML-N, MQM submits papers

Mr Gilani, who had taken oath as MNA on Feb 29 after winning the NA seat from Multan and voted for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif during the election of the prime minister in the National Assembly on Sunday, is being tipped as the next Senate chairman as per the power-sharing formula agreed between the PPP and the PML-N.
Though there has been no official announcement that Mr Gilani is the candidate of the newly-formed eight-party ruling coalition for the top Senate office, the fact that no one from the PML-N submitted papers against him gives credence to such reports. The PML-N has clear majority in the National Assembly where polling will be held for the election on the Senate seat from Islamabad and, therefore, could have easily won the seat.
Chaudhry Ilyas Mehrban is an old PTI member and had earlier contested for the National Assembly seat from Islamabad in the 2013 elections, which he lost to PML-N’s Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry.
It is interesting to note that despite the announcement of the schedule for the election by the ECP, at least two ‘strangers’ attended the Senate session in violation of the clear constitutional provision.
They included Nisar Khuhro and Jam Mehtab Dahar, both from Pakistan Peoples Party, who had already been elected as members of the Sindh Assembly.
Names of both were on the list of six senators whose seats had fallen vacant. Others on the list include Yousaf Raza Gilani and Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri who won National Assembly seats, Sarfraz Bugti and Prince Ahmed Omar who won Balochistan Assembly seats.
Mr Bugti, who had taken the oath as caretaker interior minister in August, had resigned in December last year to contest election for the provincial assembly seat.
It is also a legal question as to why the office of Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani has not been declared vacant, following his election as member of the Balochistan Assembly. Constitutional experts say the law is very clear and the seat of a sitting member of the parliament automatically becomes vacant after his election to another assembly.
Seven from Sindh
As many as seven candidates submitted their papers to the provincial chief election commissioner in Karachi to contest the election on the two general seats of the Senate. Those who submitted the papers are Jam Saifullah Khan, Muhammad Aslam Abro, Waqar Mehdi and Mukhtar Ahmed Dhamra of the PPP and Nazeerullah, Shazia Sohail and Jameel Ahmed of the SIC.
Waqar Mehdi is presently a senator, but he is due to retire on March 11 after completing six-year term.
Candidates from Balochistan
Twelve candidates of different parties have filed their nomination papers for contesting election of three vacant Senate seats from Balochistan.
 
 

This time around, though, only 96 members will grace the chamber as the representation of the erstwhile tribal areas will end, following their merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa under the 25th Constitutional Amendment.
Former chief minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo of the PPP and Kahuda Babar of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) are among those who filed the papers. Other candidates are Mobeen Ahmed Khilji (BAP), Sardarzada Mir Harbayer Domki (PPP), Mir Dostain Domki (PML-N), Shakeel Ahmed Durrani (PPP), Tariq Masoori, Kashif Aziz, Syed Mehmood Shah (JUI-F), Abdul Shakoor Khan, Danish Hussian Langove and Mr Khan.
The total strength of the Senate has been 100, including 23 members each from the four federating units, and four each from erstwhile Fata and Islamabad. The 23 seats allocated to a province comprise 14 general seats, four reserved for women, four for technocrats and one for a minority member.
Half of the senators are due to retire on March 11 after completing their six-year term and after the by-elections on six vacant seats on March 14, the ECP will issue the schedule for the election of 48 new senators — 11 each from all the four provinces on general and technocrats seats, two from Islamabad and two minority members from Punjab and Sindh.

4,Inclement weather takes its toll across the country,"At least 27, including 18 children, killed in rain-related incidents in KP; many stranded in GB due to road closures.","

• At least 27, including 18 children, killed in rain-related incidents in KP
• Many stranded in GB due to road closures
• Quetta freezes, cold wave sweeps across province
PESHAWAR / GILGIT / QUETTA: The death toll from torrential rain and snowfall in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reached 27, including 18 children, on Sunday.
Besides, at least 38 people, inc­luding 20 children, were injured in several incidents related to rain and snowfall over the past two days, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of KP.
Meanwhile, major roads rem­ained closed in Gilgit-Baltistan, leaving thousands stranded in the region. Power and water supply and communication services were also severely hit in many areas.
On the other hand, Quetta and other parts of Balochistan remained in the grip of freezing wea­ther, with sub-zero tem­peratures driving people indoors and thinning traffic on roads. In KP, rain and snowfall in most areas continued for the third consecutive day, destroying 33 houses and partially damaging 129 others. Similarly, 59 cattle heads have also perished in these rain-related incidents.
 
 

According to the Met Office, 89 millimetres of rain was recorded in Lower Dir in the previous 24 hours, 54 in Dir Upper, 38 in Chitral, and 20 in Malam Jabba, Swat.
Six people were killed in Khyber, five in Bajaur, four each in Malakand and Swat, three in Lower Dir, and one each in Lakki Marwat and Mardan.
Most damages to houses were reported in North Waziristan, with 22 houses fully damaged, followed by three houses destroyed in Malakand and two each in Swat and Upper Dir.
Similarly, 27 houses were partially damaged in Bajaur, 16 in Malakand, 20 in Khyber, 12 in Lower Dir, nine in Orakzai, eight in Charsadda, and six each in Upper Dir, Mardan and Buner.
GB roads remain blocked
In Gilgit-Baltistan, the Karakoram Highway, Baltistan Road and other major roads remained blocked for the second consecutive day on Sunday at multiple locations, rendering thousands of tourists stranded at various points.
 
 

According to the GB Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), heavy rain and snowfall in upper areas of the region started on Friday evening. Landslides triggered by rains have blocked the Karakoram Highway at several points, including the Kohistan, Gilgit-Diamer, Gilgit-Hunza, and Nagar sections.
Mushtaq Ahmed, a resident of Nagar, recounted to Dawn how his family’s journey from Islamabad to Gilgit-Baltistan was halted in the Besham area of Shangla district due to the blockage of Karakoram Highway in Kohistan, leading to significant hardships including lack of accommodation, food and basic amenities.
The situation is worse in remote areas where mobile and internet services are unavailable, forcing people to endure extremely cold weather without food or shelter.
Faizullah Faraq, a spokesperson for the GB government, said efforts were underway to remove debris from the Karakoram Highway, Baltistan Road and other roads.
He said the rescue of stranded passengers had also been started with the support of the Pakistan Army and the civil armed force Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts.
“The Karakoram Highway is blocked at 35 places in Kohistan and Diamer areas, causing thousands of travellers to be stranded in the severe cold. The communication system has also been damaged and dozens of vehicles were hit by rocks,” he said.
Mr Faraq commended the role of Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts in helping stranded passengers and providing them with necessary shelter and sustenance. The body of a passenger who perished in a car accident on the Karakoram Highway on Friday in the Patan area was transported by the scouts to the Thalchi area of Diamer on foot, he said.
Balochistan situation
Meanwhile, heavy snowfall has brought daily life to a standstill in Quetta and other northern parts of Balochistan, with critical highways and inter-provincial roads being blocked since Saturday, cutting off many areas from district headquarters.
 
 

The region has been hit by chilly Siberian winds, lashing Quetta, Pishin, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Kalat, Mastung, Muslim Bagh, and Khanozai, among others, plunging temperatures below freezing.
Quetta experienced a minimum temperature of minus 6 degrees Celsius, while other areas like Kalat and Ziarat recorded temperatures as low as minus 7 degrees.
The cold weather has led to water pipelines freezing and bursting, and residents are facing the brunt of power outages and low gas supplies, marking one of the coldest days in the province. The meteorological office anticipates further drops in the mercury, particularly at night.
The province’s communication systems have also been severely affected, leaving most cities in northern Balochistan without internet and WhatsApp connectivity.
Despite the sunshine on Sunday, Quetta remained under the influence of the cold Siberian winds for the past 24 hours, forcing people to stay at their homes. The city’s business centres and markets presented a deserted look as most shops were closed and traffic was thin.
Snowfall began on Thursday night, continuing sporadically in Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Ziarat, Pishin, Barshore, Toba Kakari, Kalat, Mastung, Sanjavi, Zhob and many other towns. The Ziarat valley has received around 10 inches of snow.
Efforts by the National Highway Authority (NHA) and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Balochistan to clear the Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan-Islamabad highway and other inter-district roads are ongoing. Officials have asked citizens to avoid unnecessary travel following snowfall due to hazardous road conditions.
In Gwadar, although the flood situation has seen slight improvements with no new rainfall, accumulated floodwater remains a challenge. Local authorities are employing heavy-duty pumps to dewater many areas.
Meanwhile, the coastal highway has been reopened for small vehicles while repairs to damaged roads were underway.
According to APP, nine highways and motorways affected by rainfall, snowfall and landsliding in Balochistan have been reopened. Que­tta-Chaman, Qila Saif­ullah-Loralai, Lakpass-Noshki-Nokundi, Zhob-Kuchlak-Dan­asar, Quetta-Sibbi-Jacob­abad, Karachi-Khuzdar-Que­tta, Gwadar-Khuzdar-Wangu Hill, Coastal Highway and Hoshab-Naag-Surab national highways have been opened for all kinds of traffic.
