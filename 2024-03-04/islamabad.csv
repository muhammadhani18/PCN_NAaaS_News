0,"Only paper mulberry trees cut down in F-9 Park, SC told","CDA report says plantation of different species in park underway, 36,000 saplings to be planted by mid-April","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has informed the Supreme Court of Pakistan that about 7,000 paper mulberry trees have been removed from Fatima Jinnah Park recently.
The civic body placed this information before the apex court in a report which will be taken up on Monday (today).
“Approximately 7,000 trees classified as paper mulberry were removed from different patches and pockets of 55 acres area labelled as recreation and picnic fields in Fatima Jinnah, F-9 Park. Its planning was started in 2020 by constituting the environmental committee including representation of Pak-EPA for consultation,” stated the CDA report.
It claimed that in entire Islamabad, the densest population of mulberry trees exited in Fatima Jinnah. The CDA had already planted 15,000 trees [of various species] last month in the park and by mid-April this year the new plantation would reach the figure of 36,000, said the report.

CDA report says plantation of different species in park underway, 36,000 saplings to be planted by mid-April

“Through proper contract, we removed paper mulberry trees only, therefore, we have submitted our report to honorable Supreme Court,” said an official of the CDA, adding paper mulberry trees were the source of allergy and parliament’s standing committees and other forums had been directing the CDA for years to remove such trees in Islamabad.
He said only paper mulberry were removed and no other tree was chopped off, stating that in the area where paper mulberry existed other species can’t survive.
Another official, however, said: “If only paper mulberry trees were removed after adopting proper procedure, the CDA should be encouraged by the apex court and this exercise should be extended to other parts of the city as well. But if other trees such as sheesham were felled in F-9 Park under the pretext of paper mulberry removal, action should be taken against the CDA officials,” he said.
The Supreme Court in a suo motu case took notice of tree-cutting in F-9 Park recently and on Tuesday restrained the CDA from cutting trees in the park until the next date of hearing.
The apex court had directed the CDA for furnishing a report about the matter. The court had taken notice on a note put up by its registrar, stating: “It has been reported that a larger number of trees have been cut and there is a systematic deforestation taking place in the Fatima Jinnah Park, F-9. Citizens are complaining that the trees have been cut on the directions of CDA and that the Supreme Court should intervene to prevent this valuable resource of the citizens from being destroyed.”
The CDA report stated that the park’s short and long term objectives were connected to replanting or reforestation of the area under removal of vegetation.
“These initiatives include improving the park’s aesthetic appeal and reestablishing a native plant community. Prior to removing the species of B. apyrifera and groundcover vegetation from designated park areas, a replanting plan has been created with a map that contains all of the features that are anticipated to be revised,” read the report.
It said the thinning of vegetation by removing B. apyrifera from specified locations presented a spectacular view of the topographic features; they become more visible in the park. The visual aesthetic qualities of the park’s landscape and scenic beauty have been considered positively keeping the potential interest of the visitors into consideration. A few themed parks and arboretum (trees) pavilions have been designed in order to improve the beauty of the replanted region.
The report said F-9 Park spreads over 760 acres of which 240 acres was already developed whereas the remaining was yet to be developed as per approved conceptual plan. In 1992, the park was inaugurated and planned as a public park where there are playgrounds, artificial waterfalls, children’s play zones, amphitheaters and other entertainment areas.
The report said paper mulberry was densely planted in 1970s as it was a fast-growing invasive species. Islamabad was classified as a barren land where there was no extensive tree cover available and therefore the plantation was carried out through aerial spraying of seeds.
It said this park was planned to be the source of air quality improvement as a carbon sink for the emissions of vehicle moving not only all sides of roads of the park but also a place within the capital city enriched with fresh air for commuters.
The park is daily used by thousands of citizens for evening walk. Whereas due to pollen allergy from paper mulberry, the number of visitors decreased in the spring season as they were compelled to stay indoors.
With prior consultation with EPA from time-to-time, a sizable number of paper mulberry trees have been removed in the residential sectors gradually so that the green character of the capital is not lost abruptly.
However, it is still found in abundance in Shakarparian, Rawal Lake area and in the foothills of Margalla Hills National Park.

1,PML-N lawmakers on no-fly list in ex-MPA murder case,"Rawalpindi police place four suspects, including Senator Chaudhry Tanveer and MNA Daniyal Chaudhry, on Provincial National Identification List.","RAWALPINDI: Police investigating the purported targeted killing of an ex-MPA in Rawalpindi have placed four suspects, including PML-N Senator Chaudhry Tanveer and MNA Daniyal Chaudhry, on the Provincial National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from leaving the country.
A senior police official confirmed that the names of suspects named in the FIR had been placed on PNIL to prevent them from going abroad as they will be included in the murder investigation in light of the statements of the two suspected shooters. Besides the two arrests of suspected shooters Danish Bhatti and Junaid, the police have also detained the father of one of them who was reportedly aware of the murder plan, the sources said.
Chaudhry Muhammad Adnan, 48, an independent candidate in the Feb 8 elections was assassinated by unidentified motorcycle riders outside the Police Lines Headquarters on February, 12, while he was on his way to his Jhanda Chichi road residence from Kutchery Chowk in Rawalpindi.
The murder occurred in the Civil Lines area, which has already been declared as the ‘red zone’ in the garrison city. After the registration of the FIR by Chaudhry Nadeem Iqbal, brother-in-law of the deceased, the police launched an investigation to arrest the culprits. According to the complainant, Chaudhry Adnan was on his way to his residence in a black SUV with his aides, after negotiating a land issue at a housing society office.
When his vehicle stopped at a traffic light near Jinnah Park, two unidentified persons wearing ‘shalwar kameez’ came close to the driving seat and started shooting at him. The FIR said that the ex-MPA was hit in the neck, face, and other body parts while the assailants sped off on their motorcycle which was parked across the road. Chaudhry Adnan lost his life while being shifted to the Benazir Bhutto Hospital by the emergency service staff of Rescue 1122.
The FIR had named PML-N lawmakers Chaudhry Tanveer and Daniyal Chaudhry, Osama Tanveer, and Chaudhry Chengaiz Khan.
Two ‘shooters’ arrested
During the course of the probe, the police detained two suspected ‘shooters’ after tracing the motorcycle that was used in the crime and sent both to jail for the identification parade on Thursday.
According to sources, the two suspects were arrested by the police in Karachi and brought to Rawalpindi. The arrests materialised after the police traced the motorcycle they had used in the killing of ex-MPA Chaudhry Adnan.
Following the investigation into the murder case, the police sent a request to the authorities concerned for placing the names of four people accused of the murder to place their names on the PNIL to prevent them from leaving the country. Subsequently, the names of PML-N Senator Chaudhry Tanveer Khan, Daniyal Chaudhry, Osama Tanveer, and Chaudhry Chengaiz Khan were placed on the no-fly list. The police also claimed to have “obtained important information [from ‘shooters] which could lead them to the mastermind of the murder”.

During the drive, vegetable markets, bus terminals and cemeteries will be cleared of waste and awareness camps will be set up at UC levels in the six tehsils.
At a meeting held at the deputy commissioner office, which was attended by all six assistant commissioners and officials from district council and municipal committee as well as local government, Khawaja Hassan, the deputy director local government, said out of 71 union councils (UCs) zero waste and wall-chalking had been ensured in two UCs, 16 out of 18 water filtration plants made functional, nine manholes covered, 1,879 streetlights made functional, 38 block drains cleared while 286 banners removed across the district during the last three days.

10,Plan to prevent Leh flooding sent for approval,Consultant will be hired for Rs48m study to lay trunk sewer in nullah,"RAWALPINDI: In order to bring an end to chronic flooding in Leh Nullah, particularly during the monsoon season, the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has completed a plan for a Rs48 million feasibility study after hiring a consultant to lay a trunk sewer in the channel from Moti Mahal to Gorakhpur on Adiala Road.
An RDA official told Dawn that the approval would be granted by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, after which a consultant would be hired to conduct a feasibility study for the trunk sewer in Leh Nullah to avoid potential floods. The official said the chief secretary had asked the authority last month to chalk up a plan for the feasibility study and send a summary to the government in this regard.
The official added that Rs48 million would be spent on the feasibility study and a consultant firm would conduct the survey of the city and prepare a report about the sewerage system in the urban areas. He said the provincial government wanted to execute this project to solve the flooding issue as soon as possible.
The divisional administration also wants to construct a road on both sides of the Leh Nullah from the Kattarian bridge to the Moti Mehal cinema. “It will take more time and money as the government will have to procure private land on both sides of the Leh Nullah for the construction of this road,” an RDA official said.

Consultant will be hired for Rs48m study to lay trunk sewer in nullah

According to the official, there was a dire need to start this project to avert the Leh flooding in the future and the trunk sewer would play a major role in this regard.
According to officials, the length of the Leh nullah from Kattarian Bridge to Soan River near the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench building is 16 kilometres and the daily discharge of wastewater is about 600 cusecs.
In the last five years, the RDA prepared two PC-I for the Leh Nullah Expressway and Flood Channel project to construct roads on both sides of the nullah and a flood channel to avoid flooding in the garrison city during the monsoon.
The Punjab Communication and Works Department finalised the feasibility study of the signal-free corridor from Kutchery Chowk to Pirwadhai Mor worth Rs8.2 billion and submitted it to the Planning and Development Department for approval.
Separately, Commissioner Aamir Khattak asked the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation and RDA to make a “comprehensive plan to eliminate the encroachments” along the Leh Nullah on a permanent basis and make a proposal to construct a road on its both sides.
He said that the feasibility of the signal-free corridor had been completed, adding that Adiala Road was also being converted into a dual carriageway.
He added there was some progress on the summary for this project and the work would be completed quickly. He further said that the plantation campaign in the entire division should be completed on time and special attention should be paid to making Murree more green.

11,PML-N MNAs say Pakistan’s ‘journey to progress’ to resume with Shehbaz’s election,PTI legislators claim new govt has no plan for country’s development.,"ISLAMABAD: Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) belonging to Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) claimed on Sunday that the ‘journey to progress’, which was halted in 2018, would resume after Shehbaz Sharif was elected the prime minister.
However, MNAs from the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), who had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), were of the view that the government had no plan for the country’s progress.
Although it was a holiday on Sunday, majority of the MNAs belonging to various political parties, apart from Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), which did not participate in the polling, reached the Parliament House for the election of the prime minister.
 
 

PML-N leader Marriyum Aurangzeb, while speaking to mediapersons, said it was a blessing that Shehbaz Sharif had become the prime minister.

PTI legislators claim new govt has no plan for country’s development

“The way the prime minister completed his speech, despite hooting by the opposition, he will complete his five-year tenure of the government. Shehbaz Sharif invited the opposition to play role for the development of the country, but unfortunately, the opposition is not interested,” she said.
Ms Aurangzeb alleged that in 2018, PTI was imposed on Pakistan through RTS, and during its tenure, the country suffered a lot. She alleged that the PTI came with the agenda to derail democracy and sabotage the economy.
However, PTI legislator Zartaj Gul said the nation had given the decision in favour of the PTI in the February 8 polls and that the “selection” of the prime minister on Sunday was just a mock exercise.
“Their faces were showing that they have not won the election, and they do not have any policy and vision to address the issues of Pakistan,” she said.
MNA Jamshed Dasti said that efforts would be made to block the ways of corruption. He claimed that the PML-N-led government would not sustain six months. MNA Atif Khan said the PTI was in contact with all parties who have raised objections over the elections.
PML-N legislator Hanif Abbasi said it was unfortunate that the PTI was levelling allegations of corruption without realising that it had won most of the seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
 
 

“According to a report, 58pc people have shown confidence in the February 8 polling, and they believe that it was transparent. However, 70pc people believe that elections in KP were rigged,” he said.
He said it would not be easy to run the country, but only the PML-N was capable of addressing the issues in Pakistan.
Aijaz Jakhrani, who belongs to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), said: “Since 2013, PTI has accepted the election results when it wins and rejects the polls when it loses.”
“My party has always rendered sacrifices for the people and always played a role to save Pakistan. After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, in 2007, most of the parties had announced that they would boycott the election, but the PPP decided to participate in the polls. Today Pakistan is going through sensitive times, so we decided to support the government,” he said.
He urged the PTI to sit in the parliament and start dialogue with the government.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) leader Aminul Haq said his party would stand shoulder to shoulder with the PML-N.
Khawaja Asif said the issue of missing persons in Balochistan should be addressed, suggesting the Baloch leaders, who had been sitting in governments for three to four decades, to think about the people of their province.
“However, it is a fact that in Balochistan, feudals have their own jails, and they keep people there,” he said.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said his party would play a role in getting thousands of workers released from jails. He said it was unfortunate that PTV ran the speech of Shehbaz Sharif live but did not telecast the speech of Omar Ayub Khan.
He warned that if the attitude of the government did not change, it would become difficult to run the parliament.
Former deputy mayor Islamabad Zeeshan Shah distributed sweets among the workers on the premises of the Parliament House soon after Shehbaz Sharif became the prime minister.

12,Two pythons released in wild in AJK,MUZAFFARABAD: Two Indian rock pythons were released by the wildlife officials into their natural habitatin Kotli...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Two Indian rock pythons were released by the wildlife officials into their natural habitatin Kotli district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)on Sunday hours after they were spotted close to a human settlement.
Hameed Gorsi, a field supervisor in Kotli district, told Dawn by telephone that they had received a report from Gulpur area in Charhoi tehsil that two Indian pythons had been spotted near human population.
“Since our staff was already present at the nearby Mahseer Fish Hatchery in connection with observance of the World Wildlife Day, we immediately dispatched them to the reported area, where a large number of people from the local community had also reached,” he said.
Mr Gorsi said that the wildlife staff safely rescued both non-venomous snakes, measuring 8 to 9 feet each, and released them in a secure habitat, away from the human population.
While expressing gratitude to the local community for timely alerting the wildlife department about the presence of the pythons, the wildlife officials also seized the opportunity to enhance awareness among them regarding the importance and usefulness of wildlife, he said.
The Indian python (python molurus) is a large python species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is also known by the common names black-tailed python, Indian rock python and Asian rock python.
In Azad Kashmir, they are found in Bhimber, Mirpur and Kotli districts of Mirpur division.
Mirpur-based wildlife assistant director Mohammad Sajid said previously a large number of people would kill pythons, wrongly assuming that they engulfed their sheep and goats while these non-venomous snakes feed themselves on rodents, jackals, small monkeys and wild boars and some other wildlife species.
This was why the population of pythons was at risk of extinction in AJK, he said, adding that lately their population had recorded a considerable increase in Mirpur division because of the greater awareness among the people about conservation of wildlife.
Over the past two years, over a dozen pythons were rescued from different areas of Mirpur division and subsequently released into their natural habitat, Mr Sajid said.

15,‘WASH sector’s climate resilience vital to achieve UN sustainable goals’,"Urban flooding in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi can damage water sources, sanitation facilities, says ministry official","ISLAMABAD: Ensuring water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and services sustainable, safe and resilient to climate change impacts is critical for making communities in Pakistan climate-resilient.
This was stated by Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination on Sunday. It said building climate resilience of the country’s WASH sector was vital to achieve other UN sustainable goals that included goal-3 (good health and well-being), goal-4 (quality education), goal-6 (clean water and sanitation), goal-8 (decent work and economic growth) and goal-13 (climate change).
Ministry’s spokesperson Mohammad Saleem Shaikh said efforts were being taken at all levels to make the country’s WASH-related facilities climate-resilient for achieving sustained delivery of the public service of safe water and sanitation, particularly during disaster situations.
He said climate impacts were already being felt everywhere, more severely in resource-poor developing countries, including Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.

Urban flooding in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi can damage water sources, sanitation facilities, says ministry official

“What was astonishing to note was that these devastating impacts were being felt through water in shape of unpredictable rainfall patterns, glacial melting, shrinking ice sheets, rising sea levels, plunging groundwater resources, floods and droughts,” he added.
In other situations, increased demand for water due to low rainfall could cause water sources (including boreholes and springs) to run dry. Conversely, heavy rainfall and flooding like recent urban flooding of flood-vulnerable Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi cities could damage water sources and sanitation facilities, carry runoff and waste into streams and lakes and contaminate the water supply, the official added.
“Water scarcity through climate change and the consequent increase in the costs of water was prone aggravates further issues of inequitable access to WASH-related public services, making people suffer from various negative health impacts. Because, this situation of water shortages and damages to the WASH infrastructure often deprives households of opportunities to collect the amount of safe water for drinking, meeting sanitation and hygiene needs for proper hand washing, limiting particularly children’s ability to grow up healthy and strong.
Addressing these challenges for making country’s WASH sector climate-proof is a daunting task and calls for well-coordinated and unfailing concerted efforts by all relevant federal and provincial stakeholders as well as those with expertise in the sector.
Identifying climate threats to WASH infrastructure, services and communities is the foremost coping measure.
“However, the ministry has already engaged and coordinating with all stakeholders including Unicef, Wateraid-Pakistan and other non-governmental organisations not only to identify the risks posed to WASH services by climate change but also develop evidence-based solutions to deal with devastating impacts of climate change on the country’s WASH infrastructure facilities so that services regarding water, sanitation and hygiene remain uninterrupted,” Mr Shaikh said.
Quoting from reports of Unicef, the official said around 450 million children lived in areas marked as high or extremely high water vulnerability, where such a huge number of children do not have adequate water to meet their everyday needs for drinking, sanitation and hygiene.
By 2040, almost one in four children would be living in areas of extremely high water stress, he added, quoting the figures from the reports.
“Thus, when disasters hit, they can destroy or contaminate entire water supplies in these high or extremely high water vulnerability areas, aggravating further the risk of the water-borne diseases, mainly diahorrea, cholera and typhoid to which children are particularly vulnerable,” he said.
He said making water supply and sanitation systems that could withstand climate change impacts could save help save lives of millions, particularly women, elderly people and children every year dyeing of various water-borne diseases like diahorrea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, E-coli infection, malaria and dengue.
Talking about various policy implementation measures to address the climate change impacts on water and sanitation infrastructure and facilities, the official said there were solutions being promoted and supported for their implementation in collaboration with provincial and local governments to mitigate climate-related risks to WASH systems. These included reviewing and altering the location or design of a water point or latrine (to make them flood- or cyclone-proof) or technology (deeper boreholes) or promoting renewable energy instead of diesel. Such changes were vital to ensure that the water point or the latrine continues to be functional and accessible for decades even after extreme weather events.
The official said efforts were also being made to priorities climate-related risks based on the assessment and identify technologies and infrastructures to improve climate resilience of the country’s WASH sector.
