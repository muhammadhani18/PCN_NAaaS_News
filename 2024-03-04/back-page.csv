1,Minor girl drowns in Channel crossing bid,“Several people are in custody” over the incident.,"LILLE: A seven-year-old girl drowned on Sunday when a small boat carrying 16 migrants heading from northern France to Britain capsized, the prefecture in France’s Nord department said.
The boat “was not appropriately sized to carry so many people,” the local authority said in a statement, causing it to capsize soon after people boarded in the Aa canal, a few kilometres from the waterway’s exit into the Channel.
The inland accident is the latest in a trend that has seen migrants aiming to get to Britain from France boarding boats away from the coast to avoid stepped-up surveillance there.
Police and firefighters rushed to the scene after a person out for a walk raised the alarm, the prefecture added.
The seven-year-old girl had died “on the spot of the effects of cardio-respiratory arrest,” prosecutors in Dunkirk told AFP, adding that rescuers’ attempts to resuscitate her had been “in vain”.
“Several people are in custody” over the incident, they added, with investigators probing possible charges including manslaughter, people-smuggling and forming a criminal gang.
The prefecture said the girl’s parents, who were travelling with three more of their children, were taken to a hospital in Dunkirk.
Prosecutors said 10 children, aged seven to 13, had been on the boat, with the prefecture identifying the other passengers as the girl’s parents, another couple and two young men. It alleged that the vessel was “apparently stolen”.
Migrant crossings of the English Channel remain a sore point between Britain and France.
British interior minister James Cleverly told AFP in January that the two countries would “expand upon” cooperation he said had proved successful, citing figures showing a 36 per cent reduction in crossings in 2023.

2,Israel ‘stays away’ from Cairo truce talks,"As famine spreads, health ministry says at least 16 children have died of malnutrition in recent days."," 

RAFAH: Palestinian men salvage bread found amid the rubble of a house, destroyed in an overnight Israeli air strike in the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday. The UN has warned of famine in Gaza.

GAZA STRIP: Egypt on Sunday hosted envoys for talks on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but an Israeli newspaper reported that Tel Aviv had boycotted the negotiations after its demand for a complete list of surviving prisoners was turned down.
A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for the talks, billed as a possible final hurdle before an agreement that would halt the fighting for six weeks.
But by early evening there was no sign of the Israelis.
“There is no Israeli delegation in Cairo,” Ynet, the online version of Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, quoted unidentified Israeli officials as saying.

As famine spreads, health ministry says at least 16 children have died of malnutrition in recent days

After the Hamas delegation arrived, a Palestinian official told Reuters the deal was “not yet there”. From the Israeli side, there was no official comment.
Washington has insisted the ceasefire deal is close and should be in place in time to halt fighting by the start of Ramazan, just a week away. But the warring sides have given little sign in public of backing away from previous demands.
A Hamas official said earlier that if Israel were to meet its demands — which have included a military withdrawal from Gaza and stepped-up humanitarian aid — this would pave the way for an agreement within the next 24 to 48 hours.
An agreement would bring the first extended truce of the war, which has raged for five months so far with just a week-long pause in November. Dozens of hostages held by the militants would be freed in return for hundreds of Palestinian detainees.
On Sunday, the health ministry in the Gaza Strip said at least 90 Palestinians had been killed in the past 24 hours, including 14 family members whose house in the Rafah refugee camp had been hit. Two of them, twin babies Naeem and Wissam Abu Anza, were buried on Sunday. Relative Shehda Abu Anza said there were only civilians at the family home.
 






“All of them were sleeping when suddenly a missile hit and destroyed the whole house,” he said while family members and other residents searched the rubble with their bare hands for bodies and also to salvage food.
16 children die of malnutrition
In a sign of the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said at least 16 children had died of malnutrition in recent days as famine spreads to the north.
As Gaza faces dwindling deliveries of relief supplies across its land borders, Israel’s top ally the United States carried out a first airdrop, joining several Arab and European government that have parachuted in aid.
But officials and aid groups have said such operations are limited in scope and cannot replace overland aid access.
The Hamas official said the group would demand the entry of at least 400 to 500 trucks per day carrying food, medicine and fuel as part of a truce deal.
Osama Hamdan, a Lebanon-based Hamas official, told Qatar’s Al-Araby TV that the group insisted on a complete, rather than temporary ceasefire and on ending the aggression against our people.
Abbas to visit Turkiye
Separately, Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas will visit Turkiye next week for talks about the war and reconciliation efforts between Palestinian factions.
“There is a serious desire and effort to reach a ceasefire before Ramazan,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in closing remarks to an annual diplomacy forum in Antalya. He confirmed that Abbas would visit Ankara on Tuesday.

3,Relatives seek renewed search for vanished plane,239 candles lit before 10th anniversary of mysterious disappearance of flight MH370,"

KUALA LUMPUR: Relatives of passengers on a Malaysia Airlines plane that mysteriously vanished 10 years ago pushed for a new search on Sunday, as they spoke of enduring grief and the struggle to find closure.
Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 239 people — 227 passengers and 12 crew — disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
More than 150 passengers were Chinese nationals, but the plane has never been found despite the ‘largest search’ in aviation history. Some relatives came from China to attend the remembrance event.
About 500 relatives and their supporters gathered on Sunday at a shopping centre near the Malaysian capital for a “remembrance day”, with many visibly overcome with grief. They lit 239 candles, one for each passenger lost on the flight.

‘MH370 is not history’
“The last 10 years have been a nonstop emotional rollercoaster for me,” Grace Nathan, a 36-year-old Malaysian lawyer whose mother, Anne Daisy, 56, was on the flight, said.
Speaking to the crowd, she called on the Malaysian government to conduct a new search. “MH370 is not history,” she said.
Liu Shuang Fong, 67, from China’s Hebei province lost her 28-year-old son Li Yan Lin, who was also a passenger on the plane. “I demand justice for my son. Where is the plane?” said Liu, who flew to Malaysia for the event.
“The search must go on,” she added.
Transport Minister Anthony Loke told reporters as far Malaysia was concerned, “it is committed to finding the plane... cost is not the issue.”
He told relatives at the gathering that he would meet officials from Texas-based marine exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which conducted a previous unsuccessful search to discuss a new operation.
“We are now awaiting them to provide suitable dates and I hope to meet them soon”.
Ocean Infinity’s search in 2018 ended after several months of scouring the seabed without success.
Malaysia, China and Australia earlier had ended a fruitless two-year, A$200 million ($130.46 million) underwater hunt in January 2017. The search that covered 120,000 square kilometres in the Indian Ocean found hardly any trace of the plane, with only some pieces of debris picked up. Considered the biggest search in aviation history, the operation was suspended in 2017.
The plane’s disappearance has long been the subject of a host of theories — ranging from the credible to outlandish — including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.
A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.

4,"Trump, Haley face off in Washington primary","Ex-president heads to ""Super Tuesday"" after winning all state contests."," 

While the former president has swept Republican primaries across the country.—AFP

WASHINGTON: Presidential contenders Donald Trump and Nikki Haley will face off in the Washington, DC, Republican primary on Sunday, a small-stakes contest that could be one of Haley’s best shots to score a win over the former president.
The United States’ capital city only sends 19 out of 2,429 delegates to the Republican National Convention in July, where the nominee is formally selected. Sunday’s results are unlikely to change the trajectory of a race that Trump appears to have stitched up, having won all the previous nominating contests.
Still, the District of Columbia, as DC is formally known, could be unusually fertile territory for Haley, said a high-ranking official at SFA Fund, the main super PAC supporting Haley’s bid.
 
 

During the last competitive Republican nominating contest in DC in 2016, Trump received less than 14pc of the vote and no delegates, even as he went on to win the nomination nationally.

Ex-president heads to ‘Super Tuesday’ after winning all state contests

The local party’s single polling station in a downtown hotel has been open during daytime hours since Friday morning, and it will close for the last time on Sunday evening, after which votes will be counted.
The city is 100 per cent urban, and a relatively high proportion of residents hold a college degree. The core of Trump’s base skews rural, and he is particularly strong in areas with low educational attainment.
 
 

A lack of local opinion polls and the extremely limited number of Republicans in the city has created a degree of uncertainty about the primary’s outcome.
Haley campaigned in DC on Friday, hosting an event in the same hotel where the polling station is located. Trump’s campaign has been largely absent in the city, beyond sending out texts to local supporters asking them to vote.
The Democratic primary in Washington will be held in June.
After winning internal party elections in the states of Missouri, Michigan and Idaho, the former president has now won every state nominating contest heading into next week’s “Super Tuesday” when voters in 15 US states choose their preferred candidate for each party. Voters in the 15 states and one US territory will caucus or go to the polls on the biggest day of nominating contests in the presidential primary. Known as Super Tuesday, 874 Republican delegates will be up for grabs.

Trump has gained huge momentum in the race to capture the Republican nomination at the party convention in July and Tuesday is expected to all but secure the result.
The voting on Saturday in Missouri, Michigan and Idaho were hybrid internal elections with differing rules, in some cases reflecting rifts and tensions despite Trump’s formidable sway.
In Missouri, Trump swamped his main opponent, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, winning every county caucus in the state, The New York Times reported.
Anyone who expressed an “allegiance to the Missouri Republican Party” could vote in the county caucuses.
In Michigan, around 2,000 party activists voted in a caucus convention, and Trump won all 39 delegates up for grabs, CNN reported.
The limited vote came in the wake of chaos within the state party, including allegations of overspending and mismanagement.
Trump had grabbed 16 Michigan delegates earlier in the week in a limited primary vote.
The former president also handily won Republican caucuses in the western state of Idaho, NBC and ABC projected.
Haley has raced around the country in the run-up to Super Tuesday, trying to make an increasingly hard case against the inevitability of Trump’s nomination.
