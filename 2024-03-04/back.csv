2,Omar Ayub to be NA Opp leader,"PTI leader declares elections for the slots of PM, speaker and his deputy as ‘illegal’","The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) on Saturday decided to make PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly.
Earlier in the day, the SIC had fielded Ayub as its candidate for the post of the premier against PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, but lacking the required number of votes, it suffered a defeat.
In the contest, Ayub managed to receive only 92 votes against 201 bagged by Shehbaz, who was elected the premier for the second time.
In his speech in the NA after the new premier was elected, Ayub declared the elections for the slots of the prime minister, speaker and his deputy as “illegal”.
He also complained about not being allotted the reserved seats, which they deserved.
Ayub said they had raised the constitutional point that the House was incomplete but it was “bulldozed” by former NA speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf.
Ayub is the general secretary of the PTI but his party members won by contesting the general polls as independent candidates after not receiving an electoral symbol.
Later, they joined the SIC as part of their strategy to obtain their quota of reserved seats in the legislatures.
However, the SIC had neither applied for any reserved seat to the ECP -- a requirement under the law -- nor had it filed a priority list of candidates before the elections.

3,Bugti announces amnesty for Baloch militants,Balochistan CM urges separatists to ‘descend from mountains’,"The newly elected chief minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti, has once again urged Baloch separatists to abandon violence and return to their homes. He has pledged that his government will grant complete amnesty to all militants who lay down their arms.
""We extend an invitation to those who retreated to the mountains to come back. I hereby declare a general amnesty for those returning from the mountains,"" Bugti said on Sunday during a discussion with journalists after visiting the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation in Karachi.
He said the people of Balochistan hold Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah in high regard, which is why he deemed it necessary to pay homage at his mausoleum after assuming office as the chief minister of Balochistan.
Bugti said ensuring peace and security in Balochistan remains a significant challenge. “PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is earnest about addressing the issues confronting the province,” added Bugti, who hails from the PPP.
He noted that the PPP also raised concerns about alleged rigging in certain areas during the February 8 elections. However, he condemned a statement made by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman regarding people losing faith in the newly elected parliament.
“The Maulana's party has consistently secured 8 seats from Balochistan. Maulana Sahib lost from his own constituency in Dera Ismail Khan,” he said.
Bugti said before arriving in Karachi, he visited Gwadar, where heavy rains last week caused significant damage. “I have deployed the chief secretary there. We are striving to clear all accumulated water in the city by Monday (today),” he assured.
During his visit to Gwadar earlier, Bugti instructed the administration to continue rescue and rehabilitation operations for the affected people and ensure the swift drainage of rainwater from the affected areas. This directive was given during a high-level meeting chaired by Bugti.
He acknowledged the unprecedented situation caused by incessant rains in Gwadar and assured that the government would extend all necessary assistance to the victims. He directed the relevant departments to expedite rehabilitation and relief efforts in the rain-affected regions to safeguard lives and properties.
Commissioner Makran Division Saeed Ahmed Umrani and Deputy Commissioner Kech Aurangzeb Badini informed the meeting that approximately 187mm of rainfall had been recorded in the area during the recent spell. They reported that families affected by the torrential rain were promptly relocated to safer locations and provided with essential aid, including rations.
The chief minister commended the prompt relief actions taken by the authorities and instructed them to continue their efforts until normalcy is restored in the area.

5,SC will soon lack judge with criminal law expertise,"Justice Masood, who is set to retire this week, dealt with such cases","After the retirement of Justice Sardar Tariq Masood this week, the Supreme Court will require a judge having expertise in dealing with hardcore criminal cases.
More than 3,000 jail petitions are pending in the apex court, while around 1,000 criminal appeals are awaiting their final adjudication.
Thousands of accused are languishing in jails but their petitions are yet to be listed.
Currently, the top court is hearing jail petitions, which were filed in 2019.
It has been learnt that mostly bail matters were being listed before the bench led by Justice Masood these days.
During the tenure of former Chief of Pakistan Asif Saeed Khosa, two benches were hearing criminal cases.
Former CJP Khosa had decided two decades of old criminal appeals and jail petitions.
Last time, ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial formed a bench led by former SC judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi to hear jail petitions. That bench also included Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Athar Minallah.
However, that bench could not function after the emergence of the audio leak about the conversation between ex-judge Naqvi and former Punjab chief minister Pervez Elahi.
Incumbent CJP Qazi Faez Isa has so far not evolved any strategy for the expeditious disposal of jail petitions.
Advocate Ayesha Tasleem, who has been appointed as state counsel to represent convicted people, has confirmed that unlike in the past, jail petitions and criminal appeals were not being scheduled before the apex court.
She revealed that her two clients had died in jail before their petitions could be scheduled.
Tasleem believed that a permanent bench should be formed to hear jail petitions and criminal appeals.
Similarly, no Shariat appellate bench of the SC has been formed for the last couple of years.
During the last five years, ex-CJP Bandial, Justice (retd) Mazoor Ahmad Malik, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood and former judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi headed the benches hearing hardcore criminal cases.
However, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah in his decisions has also evolved jurisprudence on the criminal side.
After Justice Masood’ s retirement, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is required to nominate a high court judge, who is well-versed in criminal laws.
Three seats in the SC will be vacant following his retirement.
No ad-hoc judge can be appointed until permanent seats are filled.
The superior bars are against the appointment of ad-hoc judges. However, now there is cordial relationship between CJP Isa and the superior bars led by the Independent Group. The legal fraternity is urging CJP Isa to focus on judicial reforms.
Justice Masood’s retirement
A full court reference will be organised in Justice Masood’s honour on March 8.
Justice Masood was appointed as a Lahore High Court judge in September 2009. He was elevated to the SC in November 2015 before his appointment as the LHC chief justice.
In September 2021, he was appointed as a member of the JCP.
Justice Masood has always strongly advocated the seniority principle in the appointment of SC judges.
He and CJP Isa have opposed the appointment of junior high court judges to the SC during JCP meetings.
They were both against the appointment of serving SC judges including Justices Ayesha Malik, Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shahid Waheed.
These judges were nominated by ex-CJP Bandial.
Justice Masood also supported CJP Isa in difficult times.
However, he has been criticised to allow the trials of civilians in military courts.
Later, he opted to recuse himself from the larger bench hearing the government's intra-court appeals against the judgement declaring that the trials of civilians in military courts was unconstitutional.
Justice Masood was heading the bench, which granted bail to PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the cipher case.
A three-judge bench led by Justice Masood grilled the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not a providing level playing field to the PTI in the run-up to February 8 general polls.
Lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii believed that the best judges were those who could tackle core constitutional and taxation issues.
He added that even those judges who were not very comfortable with numbers but understood civil procedure and evidence did quite well.
“Everyone left over is known as a criminal law expert.""
Jaferii said Justice Masood was a criminal law expert.
“His greatest legacy in [in this connection] will be how he led a bench which suspended a judgment declaring civilian trials by the military under the Army Act illegal and then delaying the issue by deciding to recuse himself from hearing the case while those who could benefit from this decision stayed imprisoned,” he elaborated.
“He goes home today. The people who remain detained because of his judicial maneuvering saw little of his criminal law expertise.""
The other notable act that he did was to side with CJP Isa when he could have become the top judge himself.
“He did the right thing, and at the time it looked like he did it for the greater good. In our recent history we have had nearly every prominent judge accused of selfishness. In such company, justice Masood’s defiance and selflessness stands out. If he had left it at that, perhaps it would have been good enough,” Jaferii added.

6,Siraj calls new govt a ‘sham’,JI chief demands audit of polls by independent judicial commission,"Reiterating his claims of “polls rigging”, Jamaat-e-Islami chief Sirajul Haq on Sunday claimed the newly formed federal government was a sham as it came into being through manipulated results and demanded an audit of the recent elections through an independent judicial commission.
“To bring stability in the country, the institutions should abide by the Constitution and their oaths,” Siraj told the media in Lahore.
The JI chief regretted that those with Form 45 were on the streets and the ones with Form 47 were busy distributing portfolios.
“Earlier votes were snatched away, but now results are stolen.”
Siraj maintained that there would be no improvement in the country with the force of “guns and sticks” and the institutions would have to accept the decision of the people.
He continued that there were no smiles on the faces of the so-called winners in the recent elections. “They can't even congratulate each other.”
Claiming that everyone was aware of the reality, the JI chief demanded an election audit by an independent judicial commission.
Siraj demanded that the chief election commissioner should resign.
He claimed that the mandate of the JI was stolen.
“The issue is not about winning or losing, it is about violating the sanctity of the vote.”
The JI chief pledged to continue the struggle for the rights of the people in every nook and corner of the country.
In a post shared on social media platform X last month, Siraj denounced the purported electoral rigging, labelling it a direct affront to the integrity of the vote and public sentiment.
Describing it as the most egregious instance of rigging in Pakistan’s electoral history, he claimed that results were manipulated in favour of the PML-N, PPP, and MQM-P, particularly highlighting the situation in Karachi as akin to robbery, not mere theft.
Expressing his firm stance against such manipulation, the JI chief declared his personal participation in the protest in Karachi, emphasising that the robbery of the people's mandate was unequivocally unacceptable.
In December last year before the general elections, Siraj had maintained that February 8, 2024 – the date for the polls -- was going to be a “day of salvation” for the nation as “anti-people parties” would fall flat on their faces.
