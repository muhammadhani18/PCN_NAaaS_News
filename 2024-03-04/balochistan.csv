1,Punjab population may double by 2050,Report stresses awareness about family planning among rural women,"More than 5,200 maternal deaths occur annually in Punjab due to lack of family planning with the majority recorded in villages where women are not aware about their health and nutrition, a report of the Population Council has warned.
Neglect of family planning also results in increasing the infant mortality rate, the report stated, pointing out that 73 infants die in Punjab per 1000 live births before reaching the age of a year.
The report warned that the population of Punjab is increasing rapidly and is currently 127.7 million, by the year 2050 it was projected to reach 253 million.
The organisation urged the government to announce a policy to bring under control the population growth in the country.
According to the report, the past policies have failed to help curb maternal deaths in the province.
The quarterly report revealed that more the basic reason for the dire situation is ill planning in connection with family planning.
The report suggested that if the use of contraceptives rises from the current 41 per cent to 59 per cent then the lives of 2,300 can be saved each year in Punjab.
Among the more than 11,000 maternal deaths taking place annually in the country, Punjab accounts for over 5,200. The maternal death toll is highest in Punjab, with 1,900 deaths recorded in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 3,000 in Sindh and 1,000 in Balochistan.
The reports termed the deaths of 73 infants per 1,000 live births in the province the highest and blamed lack of family planning.

The Population Council experts described several reasons of the maternal deaths in Punjab, citing as the top one negligence on the part of governments to take steps to control the population growth, followed by lack of family planning by couples.
“The high maternal death toll in Punjab and the country is alarming and it is sad that our females are losing their lives due to not following family planning methods. The past governments neglected this factor and today the rapid growth of the population is the top threat to the country. A rapid growth in the population means ever increasing demand for food, schools, health facilities, jobs, infrastructure and rising pressure on the government to keep pace in providing these services to the public.
Today the whole world is watching us grapple with the population growth and the problems caused by it. Our hope is with the new government and we request the new prime minister to announce a policy in this regard in his first speech as this is a big challenge at the moment,” said Samiya Ali Shah, Director of the Population Council.
“This is a very serious issue that infants’ death ratio is hight in Punjab and the reason is no doubt uncontrolled population growth. All newly elected CMs and the PM should take seriously this matter and announce their policy on a priority,” said Dr Ali Mir, Senior Director of Programmes of the organisation.
He said it was a fact that the mother and child mortality rate was high in Punjab because of ignorance among couples regarding family planning.
“ Females are not aware of the methods of family planning and this issue is serious in the village areas of Punjab. The wish for more children and especially wish for sons forces the females to give birth to more children and they do not care about their health and food and this factor is serious. Majority of deaths occured among illiterate females as they never followed family planning and there is a need that government should form a strategy to give awareness at villages level regarding family planning,” said Dr Sabahat Habib, former MS of the Lady Wallingdon Hospital Lahore.

The two-day festival which was free and open to the public had an attendance of thousands of people.
This was the first WOW festival held in Lahore after successive festivals in Karachi and gatherings in Hunza.
The opening speech at the festival was by the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, Jane Marriott with a closing speech by the Deputy Chief Executive of the British Council, Kate Ewart-Biggs. The event was also attended by the Chair of the British Council, Dr Paul Thompson.
The programme for the WOW festival included one-of-a-kind panels, workshops, film screenings, immersive performances, vibrant marketplaces, and puppet shows and films for children. There was an exciting line-up of performances including from popular music artistes Natasha Noorani and Eva B. The closing performance was from an ensemble of artistes including Amna Riaz, Romaisa Tariq, Annural Khalid and Natasha Baig, featuring Hassan and Roshan.
Jane Marriott, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan said: “The WOW festival continues to create a safe space and platform for women and girls to discuss their challenges and celebrate their achievements. As the first woman to be the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, the UK’s work on women and girls empowerment has particular importance for me. We’ve helped two million girls get access to education, helped 9.5 million women receive family planning services and we will continue our efforts in this critical area.”
Kate Ewart-Biggs, the Deputy Chief Executive of the British Council said: “We know that no nation can truly succeed without its women and girls contributing fully and freely. That’s why our support for the WOW Festival in Pakistan is so important. The first WOW festival in South Asia took place in Pakistan eight years ago, and it has taken centre stage ever since. The barriers seem to get higher and the glass harder, but I know that there are countless examples of inspirational and powerful women from Pakistan who continue to lead and show us the way.”
Dr Paul Thompson, Chair of the British Council, said: “I was delighted to witness the first WOW festival ever held in Lahore and the enthusiasm and passion of the participants and audience. Women and girls empowerment is at the heart of our work and this festival is one of the many ways we do that in Pakistan.”
Presented in partnership with the WOW Foundation, the theme for the festival this year was Sakhiyan (Friends), an ode to friendship between women. The theme was explored through multiple topics including mental health, climate change, education, women in public spaces, the digital divide, power and patriarchy and disability.

4,Experts encourage olive cultivation,1.2m trees planted in Pothohar region,"Experts said that the government, by cultivating olives over an available area of about 10 million acres in Punjab, is bringing about a silent revolution for the sustainable development of the country. With a considerable increase in the area under potential cultivation, Pakistan is passing through a silent revolution of olive oil production, they opined.
Talking to the media on Sunday, they said that in all parts of the country, particularly the Pothohar region, olive cultivation is most suitable. Pothohar has been termed an ‘olive valley,’ where over 1.2 million olive plants are being grown over an area of 11,125 acres, engaging about 1,300 farmers, said national project director for the promotion of olive cultivation Dr Muhammad Tariq.
Over half the plants have started bearing fruit since 2019-20’s cropping period, producing 5,118 tonnes of olive oil. By the autumn of 2024, the value of oil olive production will increase to Rs1.727 billion, he said. The value of oil by 2024 is expected to be Rs71 million, he told.
To a query, he said that in 2024, the country will have about 3m fruit-bearing olive plants producing roughly 1,415 tonnes of olive oil, with an estimated value of Rs4.416bn. The climate change ministry also plans to plant 1m olive plants. Edible oil is a daily use food item and Pakistan has been chronically deficient in its production. Over 80 percent of domestic requirements are met through imports, he added.
Dr Waqas Cheema, a scientific officer at Promotion of Olive cultivation project, told the media that over 1.5 million olive plants have already been planted under the Promotion of Olive cultivation project Phase-II. This initiative would help strengthen the national efforts to enhance the output of domestic edible oil for reducing the reliance on the imported commodity as well as to save much-needed foreign exchange, he said.
PSDP sources told APP that despite running short of funds, they have cultivated olives over 1,100 acres of land. Special focus is given to the grafting of already present 5 million wild olives after detailed survey and study and make it a fruitful economic asset for the farmers and country.
Moreover, water saving technology such as Drip Irrigation System is also being implemented at olive plantations in areas with low water deltas. The project has remained ongoing in the country for the last decade, yet there are certain missing links or spaces in the value chain of olive sector. It is pertinent to mention that the government has imparted training through 47 training programmes to around 2,800 farmers and olive stakeholders.
Meanwhile, the government, in collaboration with other stakeholders and provincial governments, will graft over 2 million wild olive trees, he said, adding that wild olive trees over millions of acres were an untapped potential.
