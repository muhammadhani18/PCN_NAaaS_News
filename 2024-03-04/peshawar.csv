Talking to Dawn on Sunday, they said a surge in prices of daily-use items had been witnessed before the commencement of the fasting month.
“It seems that the traders, especially fruit and vegetable vendors, have made preparations to increase prices on their own free will,” they claimed.
A political activist, Gul Faraz, said that in the prevailing wave of inflation, it had become difficult for a common man to earn two-time meals for the family.
“Violation of the official price list is a common practice in Ramazan,” he deplored.
Another resident Ahmad Nawaz said that the prices of vegetables had gone beyond the purchasing limits of people. He said a layman could not think about buying fruits for his family.
“Though the government officials hold meetings of price review committees regularly, the traders do not bother to adhere to the official price lists,” he maintained.
Residents in Bannu said that the vendors had increased prices of vegetables ahead of Ramazan.
They claimed that tomatoes were available in the local markets at Rs130 to Rs150 per kg while 250gram green chilies were being sold at Rs100.
A resident said that butchers were also involved in violation of official rates fixed for beef. “Many butchers are selling meat with bones at Rs900 to Rs 1,000 in Bannu bazaars,” he claimed. They asked the provincial government and divisional and district administrations to constitute special teams for checking prices during the fasting month.
They also demanded stern legal action against traders, especially fruit and vegetable vendors and butchers, if they were found involved in selling commodities at exorbitant rates.

“People of Oghi and its suburbs have reposed their confidence in me, and elected me to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, and I would address all their core issues,” he promised while speaking to reporters in Oghi.
Flanked by local officer-bearers of PTI, Mr Ghazi said the people of two tehsils had long been demanding the district status, and the provincially-ruling party would turn their dream into reality.
“People voted for me just because of the founding chairman of PTI Imran Khan, and I would follow the latter’s mission to serve people,” Mr Ghazi said.

Ghazi says industrial zone will also be set up in region

He said an industrial zone, which the previous PTI government planned for Harigah area on state land, would be executed with the help of the chief minister. He said the industrial zone would provide jobs to thousands of residents, particularly youth,” he said.
The MPA said Oghi was rich with natural beauty and widely stretched meadows, and the government would promote tourism there.
“The Oghi and Darband tehsils are deprived of mineral royalty funds and I would raise voice against it in the assembly,” Mr Ghazi said.
He said Rescue 1122 station would soon be operational in Oghi to ensure prompt and effective service to people.
SCHOOL: The residents of Pulrah area on Sunday demanded the early reconstruction of a girls’ primary school in Bandi Mera area.
“The contractor suspended the work on school, the only educational institution in the area, early last year, adversely affecting studies of students,” resident Bukhtar Tanoli told reporters.
Flanked by a group of locals, he said the communication and works department had demolished the building some two years ago after it developed cracks.
“The reconstruction of school building was scheduled to be completed within eight months at a cost Rs16 million, but the contractor left the project incomplete,” Mr Tanoli said.
He said currently schoolgirls attended classes in a small rented building nearby.
“The rented building cannot meet requirement of classes, and mostly girls have to sit in the open,” he said.
He said girls from adjoining villages were also enrolled in the school. He said due to absence of a spacious building, a number of girls had left the school,” Tanoli said.
The resident said they had taken the delay in school’s reconstruction with high-ups of the education and communication and works departments, but to no avail.
He said the department concerned should ensure early resumption of work on the school building, or people would take to the streets.

10,Court seeks comments to plea against ban on use of Kohat tunnel by oil tankers,The ban was imposed by NHA more than seven years ago,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court has sought comments from federal government and National Highways Authority to a petition of All Pakistan Oil Tankers Owners Association, challenging the ban imposed more than seven years ago on using Kohat tunnel by oil tankers.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali issued notices to the NHA chairman, its general manager, secretary of communication ministry and Kohat deputy commissioner, directing them to submit their comments within a fortnight.
The petition was filed on behalf of All Pakistan Oil Tankers Owners Association through its provincial chairman Mohammad Shafi Marwat, seeking directives of court for the respondents to allow oil tankers to use Kohat tunnel and also declare the impugned decision as illegal.
The petitioner has also sought interim relief, requesting the court that till final disposal of the petition the oil tankers may be allowed to use Kohat tunnel.

The ban was imposed by NHA more than seven years ago

The petitioner’s counsel, Mohammad Arif Firdous, stated that construction of the 1.9-kilometre long Kohat tunnel had begun in 1999 and it was opened to traffic in June 2003.
He said that as part of developing the Indus Highway system, the tunnel served as a shorter alternate route to that of the Kotal Pass, situated between the cities of Peshawar and Kohat. He stated that the new route decreased the time required to travel through the Kotal Pass by about 20 minutes.
The counsel said that the main advantage of Kohat tunnel was that long bodied vehicles could now use Indus Highway whereas previously the narrow turns and bends on the Kotal Pass had made it impossible for such vehicles to travel.
He stated that after its opening, the vehicles of the petitioner organisation were allowed to use Kohat tunnel till 2016 and not a single accident happened throughout that period.
However, he said that all of a sudden the respondent NHA general manager issued a letter on December 9, 2016, to the commanding officer of 23 Punjab Battalion Kohat-Dara Adamkhel, asking him not to allow use of the tunnel by oil tankers.
He contended that after the ban was imposed, the association staged protests for many days and the local administration assured it that the matter would be resolved. He added that the association time and again approached different authorities including prime minister but so far no response was given to it.
Mr Firdous argued that the petitioner vehicles had now been forced to use the 11-killometre hilly track between Kohat and Dara Adamkhel, which was perilous and caused regular accidents.
He contended that the passenger vans fitted with two or three CNG tanks were allowed to pass through the tunnel despite being potential hazardous.
He pointed out that not a single tunnel was closed to oil tankers in the country except Kohat tunnel.
He added that if the ban was according to standard operating procedure (SOP) then it should be applied across the board as presently it was discriminatory.

The 32-kilometre road connected by two suspension bridges was constructed by Aga Khan Rural Support Programme under its Central Asian Poverty Programme two years ago.
The residents said that about 10 years ago, the government connected the valley with the rest of the country by constructing a jeepable track. The track passed through a long chain of hilly area, which used to remain disconnected due to rock falling, avalanches and debris that also endangered the lives of passersby, they added.
Qadam Ali, the cluster manager of 19 village organisations executing the road project, and community members Rehmat Nawaz, Sher Zaman, Faiz Mohammad and others said that the alternate road was really a ‘game changer’ for the remote valley bereft of basic amenities till recently.
They said that an all-weather road to the valley was really a dream for its dwellers. They said that the dream came true with the completion of the road project. They said that owing to limited funds, the government had not included the two bridges in its scheme and the road was aligned straight passing through the valley.
Locals said that after the closure of the road, the residents of the upper parts of the valley had to travel for more than 12 hours with the luggage on their backs or spending extra amount on paying fare for pony while the local shopkeepers also charged extra for additional expenses on transportation of items during those months.
They said that potential of agriculture and tourism remained underutilised for want of all-weather road. They said that the road would boost local economy and alleviate poverty in the area.
They said that the alternate road also connected three villages of the lower valley including Kishmanja, Pechus and Vedin Khot situated on the opposite side of the old road.

They termed the book a kaleidoscope of linguistic diversity in Chitral and sought its perseveration on state-run media outlets.
The new book in Urdu titled ‘Chitral Ki Zubanay -- Mazee, Haal, Mustaqbal’ authored by Fakhrudin Akhundzada was launched at Peshawar Press Club the other day under the banner of Anjuman Taraq-i- Khowar Halqa Peshawar.
“A monthly magazine in Khowar soon will hit bookstalls while Khowar has already been adopted as medium of instruction in schools till 8th grade. The newly published will serve as a crash course for research students,” said speakers.
Writers, poets, scholars and linguists attended the event. Addressing the function, speakers urged policymakers and academicians to take concrete steps for perseveration and promotion of all languages being spoken in Chitral valley. They added that some languages were under the threat of being extinct.
Fakhrudin Akhundzada, deputy director of Forum for Languages Initiative (FLI), on the occasion said that the book was meant to bring up some important information about linguistic diversity of his area and put forward pragmatic suggestions for saving that treasure trove for posterity.
Linguist Sher Wali Aseer said that Chitral was home to about a dozen languages with Khowar being the third big lingo in the province. Two languages, Wakhi and Yadgha, didn’t have their own scripts and depended on oral tradition, he added.
Prof Mohammad Ali Dinakhel said that the author tried his best to present a linguistic map of Chitral valley with graphic details in past, present and future perspective on scientific lines.
“All the 12 languages spoken in Chitral are reflective of rich cultural diversity and should be promoted and preserved according to the practical measures given in the said book. Being polyglots, residents of Chitral are peace-loving, accommodative and open-minded,” he said.
Prof Abaseen Yousafzai, who chaired the event, stated that linguistic diversity served as window to culturally rich society and social cohesion at large.
