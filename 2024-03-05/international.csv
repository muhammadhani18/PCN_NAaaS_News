0,Outrage over Achakzai home raid,PKMAP denounces ‘illegal’ move; Quetta DC says administration only ‘recovered govt lands’,"The Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PKMAP) staged a protest demonstration on Monday evening, denouncing what it claimed was an ‘illegal raid’ by police at the residence of Mehmood Khan Achakzai, a presidential candidate backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
However, the charge was vehemently denied by Quetta Deputy Commissioner Saad Asad who said the raid was routine work by the district administration and revenue department to reclaim a piece of land. 
PKMAP supporters gathered on various roads in the city and chanted full-throated slogans against the district administration, police and provincial government. 
""All of this happened because of a speech by the party chairman for supremacy of parliament,"" Rauf Lala, one of the central leaders of the party, claimed. 
The Quetta deputy commissioner alleged that the reclaimed land, an area of 2.5 kanals encircled by a boundary wall, was illegally occupied by the PKMAP chief. 
The party will not make any compromise over the supremacy of parliament and Constitution, Mr Lala said. He said the party chairman had always stood by the rule of law and the supremacy of the country’s Constitution.
Former caretaker Balochistan information minister Jan Achakzai also defended the raid and said that it was nothing personal against the PKMAP chief. ""It was part of a crackdown against land grabbers,"" Achakzai said.
PKMAP leaders, in their speeches, lashed out at the provincial government and accused it of punishing the party chief for what they called his democratic stance in the country. 
""We will not abandon our democratic struggle,” Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, another central leader of the party, said. 
Ziaratwal said that all-out efforts would be made to ensure the protection of democratic and human rights in the country.
Condemning the incident, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam’s (JUI-F) Hafiz Hamdullah said it was a violation of an elderly politician's home, asserting that it exposed those pulling the strings. He said that the intrusion into the sanctity of a residence goes against democratic principles, condemning the harassment of a family through such raids.
Balochistan National Party (BNP) President Akhtar Mengal took to social media platform X to condemn the raid on Mahmood Khan Achakzai's residence, expressing his outrage and emphasising a zero-tolerance stance towards the ‘suppression of truth’.
Meanwhile, former PTI leader Shireen Mazari expressed hope that the parliament would not remain silent on the incident.

1,Law and order top priority: K-P CM,Ali Amin Gandapur pledges resources for police force to fortify it with modern equipment,"The newly-elected chief minister of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, has said that enhancing law and order in the province would be the topmost priority of his government and that the commitment would not be compromised under any circumstances.
During a brief visit to Charsadda district on Monday, the chief minister said that the necessary financial resources would be promptly allocated to the police force in order to fortify it with modern equipment, arms and ammunition.
He stated that development and prosperity were not possible in the absence of peace as investment and economic activity required an enabling environment.
“Poverty alleviation, the welfare of the vulnerable segments of society and addressing the issue of unemployment will be the second important priority of the provincial government, as the prevailing financial situation has affected the ordinary citizen the most, which needs to be addressed on a priority basis,” Ali Amin Gandapur stated.
He stated that the development and enhancement of infrastructure would be the third priority for his government, and steps would be taken under a well-devised strategy.

In response to a question, the CM clarified that when he spoke about necessary reforms in the police system, it should not be construed as intimidation for any individual. 
He emphasised that he did not believe in revenge, but rather, rectification and improvement in the system were his duties. He remarked that such measures are necessary to establish a system where no one can misuse their authority or commit injustice. 
He added, ""We need to develop a system based on justice for the secure future of our coming generations.""
Earlier, the CM visited the residence of Superintendent of Police, Ijaz Khan, who embraced martyrdom in an exchange of fire with miscreants in Mardan the other day. 
He expressed condolences to the bereaved family and recited Fatiha for the eternal peace of the departed soul. He also met with the children of the deceased and assured them of the full support of his government.
Speaking on this occasion, the chief minister acknowledged that Ijaz Khan embraced martyrdom while bravely fighting against terrorists. 
He expressed his admiration for all the martyrs of the police and other security agencies who sacrificed their lives for the secure future of others. 
Ali Amin Gandapur reassured that all financial support under the Shahada package would be extended to the bereaved family, and the provincial government would provide comprehensive assistance for the better future of the children of Shaheed Ijaz Khan.

2,QWP seeks judicial scrutiny of election rigging,Party says Feb 8 polls created a sense of disappointment in nation,"The Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) has called for the establishment of a judicial commission to investigate what it describes as the ‘worst rigging’ during the general elections held on February 8. The party wants the commission to identify those responsible and impose severe punishment on these ‘national criminals.’
During a meeting of the Executive Committee held on Monday in Islamabad and chaired by party chief Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, participants expressed deep concern over the extensive rigging reported in the recent elections. 
They emphasized that this electoral malpractice has not only disillusioned the entire nation, including the parliament, but has also dashed hopes for economic revival and political stability.
The committee squarely blamed the Chief Election Commissioner and provincial members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for the rigged election results. 
They demanded a thorough investigation by a judicial commission to scrutinize the conduct of all returning officers and unveil the true culprits, advocating for strict punishment to be meted out.
According to the committee, these individuals are deemed as national criminals for their role in wasting national resources on a fraudulent exercise and causing irreparable damage to democracy. 
They lamented ongoing attempts to undermine provincial autonomy and the 18th Constitutional Amendment, affirming the QWP's commitment to thwart such conspiracies at every level.
The committee members said the election results indicated a concerted effort to undermine provincial autonomy and rights through a rigged parliament, effectively sidelining voices advocating for provincial rights in the legislative body.

3,K-P Assembly approves Rs159b March budget,House allows use of assembly hall for presidential election,"The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Assembly on Monday approved a one-month Rs159 billion provincial budget to meet the expenses of government departments for the month of March despite objections raised by opposition lawmakers.
The house, with Speaker Babar Salim Swati in the chair, also formed a committee for nominating the panel of chairmen and passed a resolution allowing the assembly hall’s use as a polling station for the upcoming presidential election, scheduled for March 9.
At the outset of the session, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur presented a Rs159 billion budget for the month of March. However, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) lawmaker Ahmad Kundi opposed the motion, terming it unconstitutional.
Kundi argued that financial matters had to be brought to the house by the provincial government. He added that the chief minister had yet to form his cabinet which meant that there was currently no government in the province as the chief minister alone did not constitute the government.
Opposition leader Dr Ibadullah advised the chief minister to name a two-member cabinet to complete the government. Dr Ibadullah stressed that, when the budget could be presented legally, there was no need to do things in violation of the law and the Constitution.
Defending the budget motion, government member Akbar Ayub stressed the house’s authority in such matters, saying that a similar motion had carried in the Punjab Assembly two days ago. Other treasury lawmakers also supported Ayub’s contention.
Zahir Shah said that, according to Article 129, the chief minister was the head of the provincial government. In that context, he said, government did exist in the province. The speaker later put the motion for a vote which was approved by the majority.
Later, Chief Minister Gandapur moved the resolution by suspending normal proceedings under Rule 240 to seek permission to use the assembly chamber as a polling station for the election of the president, due on Saturday. The motion was approved unanimously.
The house also formed the Masnad Nasheen Committee, comprising Zahir Shah, Muhammad Idris and Abdul Islam of the ruling Sunni Ittehad Council, and Ahmed Kundi of the PPP. The speaker also announced the petition committee, comprising Deputy Speaker Suraya Bibi, Aftab Alam, Faisal Khan, Mohammad Naeem, Zahir Shah, Arbab Mohammad Wasim, and Rashad Khan.
