GENEVA: The Gaza crisis is a “powder keg” with the potential to spark broader conflict in the Middle East, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on Monday.
Turk said it was imperative to do everything possible to avoid a wider conflagration.
“The war in Gaza has already generated dangerous spillover in neighbouring countries,” he said in his global update to the United Nations Human Rights Council.
“I am deeply concerned that in this powder keg, any spark could lead to a much broader conflagration. This would have implications for every country in the Middle East and many beyond it.”

US vice president uses unusually strong language to ask Israel to ensure aid reaches Gaza

He said that overlapping emergencies made the “spectre of spillover very real”.
“The military escalation in southern Lebanon between Israel, Hezbollah and other armed groups is extremely worrying,” Turk said.
The UN high commissioner for human rights said almost 200 people had been killed in Lebanon and some 90,000 internally displaced.
There was also extensive damage to health facilities, schools and vital infrastructure.
“Incidents in which civilians, including children, paramedics and journalists, have been killed in attacks must be fully investigated,” said Turk.
“It is imperative to do everything possible to avoid a wider conflagration.”
Harris slams Israel
US Vice President Kamala Harris has called for acceptance of a proposed six-week ceasefire deal, while criticising Israel over insufficient aid deliveries into Gaza.
In unusually strong language, Harris called upon Israel to take steps to increase aid into Gaza.
“Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table,” Harris said during a speech in Selma, Alabama, on Sunday.
“The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” Harris said.
She added that Israel “must open new border crossings” and “must not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the delivery of aid”.
Her comments were the strongest to date by a US administration official on Israel, as President Joe Biden comes under pressure over his support for Israel and the civilian death toll in Gaza soars.
A senior US official said on Saturday that Israel had broadly accepted the deal, which would see a six-week cessation of hostilities if Hamas agrees to release “the most vulnerable prisoners” it holds.
The Israeli army says 130 prisoners remain in Gaza, of whom 31 are believed to be dead.
The US vice president called upon Hamas to accept the truce proposal. “Hamas claims it wants a ceasefire. Well, there is a deal on the table. And as we have said, Hamas needs to agree to that deal.”
Kamala Harris deplored the Israeli bombing last week on Palestinians around a convoy of aid trucks.
“Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,” Harris said.
“People simply trying to secure food for their families after weeks of nearly no aid reaching northern Gaza… were met with gunfire and chaos,” said Harris, adding: “Our hearts break for the victims of that horrific tragedy.”
Harris delivered her remarks at the foot of Edmund Pettus Bridge, where a march by hundreds of peaceful activists was violently suppressed by police on March 7, 1965.
She is due to meet Benny Gantz, a centrist member of Israel’s emergency cabinet, in Washington this week.
“The vice president’s meeting is part of our continued efforts to engage with a wide range of Israeli officials on the war in Gaza and planning for the day after,” a White House official said on Sunday.
The former Israeli military chief, a long-time rival of Prime Minister Netanyahu, will also meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
Blinken on aid
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken appealed to both sides to ensure that aid reaches Gaza Strip’s beleaguered population soon.
“It is imperative that we expand the flow of aid into Gaza to alleviate the dire humanitarian situation,” Blinken wrote on X.
 






He added: “People urgently need more food, water, and other assistance. That’s why the US is working to get more aid in through every available channel, including air drops.” These started on Saturday.

1,Delegates matter after Haley wins Washington primary,Trump terms SC verdict on Colorado ballot a ‘big win for America’.,"WASHINGTON: When the richest haul in the US presidential primary race arrives on “Super Tuesday,” millions of Americans will cast their votes — and many of them will count for nothing.
In the primary system it is the number of allocated delegates that matters more than the popular vote count.
The Republican and Democratic nominating contests that play out across the US every four years serve to elect delegates to the national conventions, where they formally select their party’s presidential nominee.
It’s a system that tends to favour front-runners, and for Nikki Haley, the sole remaining challenger to Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, it’s one that has dulled her already razor thin chances.

Trump terms SC verdict on Colorado ballot a ‘big win for America’

Haley wins in Washington DC
On Sunday night Haley won the Washington, DC, Republican primary taking 19 delegates, her first victory in the nominating process and a symbolic win for the former US ambassador to the United Nations, Edison Research said.
Haley won 62.9 per cent of the vote, versus 33.2pc captured by the former president.
“It’s not surprising that Republicans closest to Washington dysfunction are rejecting Donald Trump and all his chaos,” Haley campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement.
With 2,429 Republican delegates from across the country, Trump needs at least 1,215 to secure his lock on the nomination.
Having won all eight early state and territory contests, he already has more than 247 delegates in his column compared to Haley’s 24 going into Super Tuesday, when more than a third of the national Republican total is up for grabs.
Trump’s dominance is such that he could cross the magic threshold as early as March 19 — even though the primary calendar stretches into early June.
On the Democratic side, incumbent Biden is a virtual lock.
The delegate numbers differ between the parties, but the process is similar. There are currently 3,934 Democratic delegates in play, and Biden’s magic number for victory is 1,968. He already has 206 delegates, and could also secure the nomination in March.
That means the re-match between Biden and Trump — who will be the oldest ever pair of nominees — will involve one of the longest presidential campaigns in US history.
The Republican National Convention is scheduled for July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, while Democrats gather for their convention in August in Chicago.
The delegates also endorse the party’s candidate for vice president, selected by the presidential hopeful and often announced a few days before the convention.
‘Trump can stay on Colorado primary ballot’
The US Supreme Court on Monday removed a potential hurdle to Trump’s bid to recapture the White House, unanimously dismissing a state court ruling that could have barred him from the ballot for engaging in insurrection.
In a 9-0 decision, the conservative-dominated court said “the judgement of the Colorado Supreme Court… cannot stand,” meaning 77-year-old Trump, the Republican White House frontrunner, can appear on the state’s primary ballot.
Trump hailed the decision, declaring a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” in a post on his Truth Social website.

2,Kyiv claims key bridge blown up; seeks assets of Russians,"Ukrainian military intelligence “confirmed” the blast, stating the rail line was used by Russia to transport military cargo.","MOSCOW: Russia’s state railway company said on Monday it had been forced to cancel and re-route some trains in the Samara region after an explosion at a rail bridge, which Ukrainian military intelligence claimed was used by trains carrying ammunition.
An explosion rocked the bridge, which spans the River Chapayevka near the Russian city of Samara, early on Monday morning, Russian news agencies reported citing emergency services.
Ukrainian military intelligence “confirmed” the blast, stating the rail line was used by Russia to transport military cargo, including ammunition made at a factory nearby. It also forecast the bridge would be out of use for some time.
Frozen Russian assets
On the other hand, Ukraine has urged the West to transfer control of confiscated Russian assets to Kyiv so they could be used to rebuild the country and fund its recovery.
“The confiscation of Russian assets should become a reliable source of support for our state and funding for our recovery,” Prime Minister Denys Shmygal told a presser.
Ukraine has warned it desperately needs more military and financial assistance, while a fresh $60bn package of US aid remains stalled in Congress.
PM Shmygal urged Western countries to act quickly ahead of elections and political changes which could disrupt the efforts. “We need predictability and stability, regardless of time, regardless of political fluctuations (and) electoral cycles that will take place in the world,” he said.
West role in conflict
Meanwhile, the Krem­lin said the content of leaked conversations between German officials discussing potential stri­kes on Crimea proved Western countries were participating in the conflict in Ukraine.
The leaks came as an embarrassment for Berlin, which is under pressure to supply Taurus missiles to Kyiv struggling with ammunition shortages.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the conversations “once again highlight the direct involvement of the collective West in the conflict in Ukraine”.
Germany said it believed the recording featured an “intercepted” conversation but could not tell whether or not it had been edited.
The Kremlin spokesman said the recording “in itself suggests that the Bundeswehr is discussing substantively and specifically plans to strike Russian territory.”

3,Protesting farmers cut off as India tops list of digital blackouts,Farmers march on Delhi again to demand higher prices for crops; activists believe communication shutdowns aim to quell dissent.,"• Farmers march on Delhi again to demand higher prices for crops
• Activists believe communication shutdowns aim to quell dissent
SHAMBHU: They have been beaten with canes, doused in tear gas and blocked by concrete barricades and metal spikes but the thousands of farmers trying to march to India’s capital to demand higher crop prices also face an invisible barrier — digital blackouts.
As their caravan of tractors and trucks moved from the northern state of Punjab towards New Delhi, the farmers found their phones going dead as state authorities imposed temporary internet shutdowns.
It is not the first time authorities have cut the internet — India imposed the highest number of internet shutdowns in the world in 2022 — and campaigners fear more digital crackdowns ahead of elections expected by May.
Farm union leaders are seeking guarantees, backed by law, of more state support or a minimum purchase price for crops.
Since Feb 12, Haryana state authorities have cut access to mobile internet services at regular intervals and for several days at a time. They said they did so to “stop the spread of misinformation and rumours” and to prevent the mobilisation of “mobs of agitators and demonstrators”, according to local media.
The farmers, many of whom are members of the Sikh religious minority from Punjab, say the shutdowns made it hard to get medical help for the injured and to source food. It also cut them off from their leaders, making coordination difficult.
“We’re already far away from home and the communication blackout adds to our miseries,” he said.
Neither the chief minister’s office in Haryana nor the state’s telecoms ministry responded to requests for comment.
Campaigners have accused the Hindu nationalist BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of repeatedly using internet shutdowns to stifle opposition.
“The alarming trend of internet shutdowns coupled with widespread online censorship is a grim reflection of digital authoritarianism, particularly in the lead-up to elections,” said Gayatri Malhotra of the digital rights organization, Internet Freedom Foundation.
No signal
India frequently uses internet shutdowns to control protests including in occupied Kashmir and northeastern Manipur state where dozens have died in ethnic clashes since last year.
Mobile access has also often been cut during elections and examinations and these shutdowns were often imposed for indefinite periods and without the publication of shutdown orders, in violation of a 2020 judgement by the nation’s top court.
The state of Haryana ranks fourth in the country for the highest number of internet shutdowns, following Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Manipur, according to Delhi-based advocacy group Software Freedom Law Center.
Although the farmers’ protest is confined to Punjab for now, their complaints of falling incomes resonate more widely, highlighting a perception in India’s huge rural hinterland that Modi has done too little to support the farming community and raise living standards.
Over 40 per cent of India’s 1.4 billion people are dependent on agriculture and many say they have suffered economically under Modi.
‘State of darkness’
Hardeep Singh, for example, grows wheat and rice on his four-acre farm, but like many he said poor returns on investments, including pesticides and farm equipment, made it increasingly difficult to make ends meet without guaranteed prices for his produce.
While pollsters say Modi will almost certainly win a rare third term in office, the discontent of farmers will be a headache for years to come.
The federal agriculture ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the protesters’ demands.
Many farmers also said signal jammers were being used in the area, preventing them from contacting people in their villages to ask for food supplies.

4,"Rihanna, Ivanka, Gates and Zuckerberg at Ambani’s wedding",US singer reportedly paid $7m for her appearance.,"

FIVE hundred dishes, more than a thousand gue­sts and a multi-million dollar budget — this is how the son of Asia’s richest man has reportedly celebrated his upcoming nuptials.
Anant Ambani and his wife-to-be Radhika Merchant’s three-day extravaganza saw Bollywood royalty rubbing shoulders with tech billionaires, sports superstars and even Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka.
According to BBC News, the event has captivated audiences in India and abroad, who have been lapping up every detail emerging from the party held by his father Mukesh Ambani in the city of Jamnagar, in Gujarat, over the weekend.
It was so big that the local airport was temporarily granted international status as it received visitors from across the country and rest of the world. Airport authorities said nearly 130 flights had arrived for the event, ferrying the likes of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg to the region.

US singer reportedly paid $7m for her appearance

Most of the guests stayed in luxury “glamping” tents near the venue that offered a level of opulence most would struggle to imagine, let alone afford — and could reportedly choose from more than 500 dishes created by dozens of chefs from across the world.
There were also hair and make-up artists, laundry services and stylists on hand to help any guests prepare for the themed gatherings taking place — said to have been carefully laid out in a nine page schedule.
The highlight was pop star Rihanna’s first ever performance in India, and the BBC reported that she was rumoured to have been paid somewhere in the range of $7m (£5.5m) for her appearance.
Some of India’s biggest film stars also danced to her hit songs on stage.
Guests were treated to a visit to Anant Ambani’s pet project — a 3,000-acre shelter that is home to thousands of animals.
It was not all about the party, however. Mukesh Ambani — the head of Reliance Industries, with an estimated net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes — has also had 14 new temples constructed in the city, according to local reports.
All eyes are now likely to be on the wedding, which is due to be held in Mumbai in July.
