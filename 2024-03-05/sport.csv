1,Leverkusen extend lead with win over 10-man Cologne,BERLIN: Bayer Leverkusen tightened their grip at the top of the Bundesliga with a 2-0 victory over 10-man Cologne to...,"BERLIN: Bayer Leverkusen tightened their grip at the top of the Bundesliga with a 2-0 victory over 10-man Cologne to pull 10 points clear of Bayern Munich.
Xabi Alonso’s side were handed the opportunity to stretch their lead over Bayern after the serial champions faltered again, only managing a 2-2 draw at Freiburg on Friday night.
“Ten points are a lot,” said Leverkusen’s Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka. “But it’s not over yet. There are still many, many more points to play for and as long as it’s not decided mathematically, we cannot say that it’s done.
“We have to keep working and pick up a few more points as a team.”
Leverkusen, who are on a German record-extending 34 games unbeaten in all competitions, made the short trip to Cologne.
They ran out deserved winners of a feisty Rhine derby, despite a spirited effort by the Bundesliga strugglers who played with 10 men from the 15th minute.
The game’s opener was crafted in the 38th minute by Alejandro Grimaldo. His low cross from the left was flicked on by Patrik Schick and stabbed in from close range by Jeremie Frimpong, for his eighth league goal of the season.
Grimaldo locked up the points in the 73rd minute, squeezing the ball in at the near post after fine work by impact substitute Amine Adli.
Forward Jan Thielmann was shown a straight red in the 15th minute after raking his studs down Xhaka’s Achilles.
That decision raised the temperature inside the RheinEnergieStadion, with referee Tobias Stieler faced with a Cologne team and 40,000 home fans in rebellious mood in the early spring sunshine.
Cologne, who occupy the relegation play-off place and remain eight points adrift of safety, adjusted well after the red card and were unlucky to twice hit the post.
But Leverkusen controlled large periods of the contest as they took another step towards their first-ever Bundesliga title with 10 games left.
In Sunday’s other Bundesliga game, a first-half double from Maximilian Beier was enough for Hoffenheim to secure a 2-1 win over Werder Bremen.

2,"Charlton lowers world record, Duplantis seizes another title in Glasgow",GLASGOW: Devynne Charlton blazed to a world record in the women’s 60-metre hurdles while pole vaulter Armand...,"GLASGOW: Devynne Charlton blazed to a world record in the women’s 60-metre hurdles while pole vaulter Armand Duplantis pulled a remarkable performance out of what had been an off-night to win gold here at the World Indoor Athletics Championships on Sunday.
Charlton, a 28-year-old from the Bahamas, clocked 7.65 seconds to shave two-hundredths of a second off the previous record she had shared with American Tia Jones.
“This means a whole lot because I have set myself goals,” said Charlton, who raced with bright pink hair. “I have not changed my technique much — just a few tweaks — but I have been working hard off the track, making sure my mental health is good and working with a sports psychologist. Just taking care of myself.”
The 24-year-old Duplantis, an Olympic and two-time world outdoor champion, cleared 6.05 metres to add a second world indoor title to his bulging resume.
Some uncharacteristic misses at lower heights had the world-record holder puffing his cheeks in frustration.
He finally cleared 6.05 on his third vault, then missed at three world-record attempts of 6.24.
American Sam Kendricks took silver with a height of 5.90, while Emmanouil Karalis of Greece won bronze with 5.85.
Noah Lyles helped the US team to a silver medal in the 4x400 metres relay — a distance he rarely runs — at the global event, a preview perhaps of his Paris Olympic intentions.
Running the third leg, the 100 and 200m specialist received the baton in first place and handed off without giving up any ground in a 45.68-second split, the third fastest of his team.
Alexander Doom, the gold medallist in the 400 a night earlier, pipped American anchor Christopher Bailey at the finish line to give Belgium gold in three minutes 2.54 seconds. The US crossed in 3:02.60.
Femke Bol captured her second title of the meet in anchoring the Dutch women to victory in the 4x400m relay. The 24-year-old had crushed her own world indoor 400m record en route to gold the previous evening.
Simon Ehammer of Switzerland won the men’s heptathlon to improve on his silver in 2022, doing just enough in the 1,000 metres — the heptathlon’s last event — to hold off Norway’s Sander Skotheim by 11 points.
Tsige Duguma of Ethiopia pulled away from home favourite Jemma Reekie over the final 50 metres to win the women’s 800 in 2:01.90. Reekie, from Scotland, crossed in 2:02.72 for silver.
American Bryce Hoppel held off Sweden’s Andreas Kramer to win the men’s 800 in 1:44.92, the quickest time in the world this season.
Geordie Beamish of New Zealand produced a brilliant kick to win the men’s 1,500 metres. Beamish, whose best event is the steeplechase, was in fifth place with 50 metres to go, swinging wide en route to a time of 3:36.54.
Ethiopian Freweyni Hailu won the women’s 1,500m, the event’s final race, in 4:01.46, with Americans Nikki Hiltz and Emily Mackay rounding out the podium.
Thea LaFond needed just two attempts to win triple jump gold and become Dominica’s first global champion in athletics.
The 29-year-old soared 15.01 metres on her second attempt in Sunday’s morning session, the best jump in the world this year, and with victory all but locked up was able to pass on her remaining four jumps.
LaFond’s previous best results were a Diamond League win in 2022 in Paris and Commonwealth Games silver and bronze medals.

Italy attacker Raspadori rammed home the winner on the rebound in the 88th minute after Wojciech Szczesny saved Victor Osimhen’s penalty, as Napoli showed glimpses that a dreadful season as Italian champions might be turning in the right direction.
Napoli looked like having to accept a draw from their lively display in the 81st minute when Federico Chiesa cancelled out Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s volleyed opener with a rifled finish of his own.
Instead Francesco Calzona’s team moved up to seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Atalanta who sit in the Europa Conference League spot following their loss earlier on Sunday.
Surprising Bologna are four points ahead of fellow in-form outfit AS Roma who are fifth following their 4-1 thumping of Monza on Saturday.
Elsewhere, Hellas Verona, 17th, recorded a 1-0 win over 19th-placed Sassuolo while Cagliari, who are just inside the bottom three but level on 23 points with Verona, edged Empoli 1-0.
Empoli are two points above the drop zone in 14th in a battle against relegation, level with Lecce who drew 1-1 at fellow strugglers Frosinone.

6,Brest consolidate second spot,"PARIS: Brest moved a little closer to Paris Saint-Germain with a 1-0 home win over Le Havre on Sunday, as Nice ...","PARIS: Brest moved a little closer to Paris Saint-Germain with a 1-0 home win over Le Havre on Sunday, as Nice missed the chance to go third in Ligue 1 with hosts Toulouse coming from a goal down to win.
A goal just after the half-hour from Pierre Lees-Melou gave Brest victory to close the gap to PSG to nine points and seal a club record 13 top-flight matches without defeat.
The win gives Brest a four-point cushion over third-placed Monaco, who played out a goalless draw with PSG on Friday.
Midfielder Lees-Melou slotted in Mathias Pereira Lage’s cross at the near post with 34 minutes on the clock in what was the decisive moment of a close-fought match.
Brest held firm in the second half to close out the three points as fatigue set in for both sides and the foul count rose.
Nice failed to hold onto a first-half lead and break back into the top three after going down 2-1 at Toulouse.
Terem Moffi gave Nice the early advantage when he fired past Guillaume Restes after eight minutes.
Affairs were levelled in the 65th minute when Warren Kamanzi crossed for Thijs Dallinga to head his ninth goal of the season and his fourth in the last five matches.
Four minutes later, the Dutch striker teed the ball up for Yann Gboho who swivelled round Pablo Rosario before crashing the ball past Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka.
Nice remain in fifth, missing the chance to go above Monaco and Lille.
For Toulouse, the win moved them up a place to tenth, leap-frogging Lyon who lost 3-0 at home to Lens in Sunday’s late match.
Florian Sotoca broke the deadlock with a predatory header just before half-time and then second-half goals from Elye Wahi and Kevin Danso sent Lens above Marseille into sixth place.
The first goal came at the end of a half that was edged by the visitors but in which Lyon looked dangerous on the counter with the pace of Ernest Nuamah, who rattled the post inside the opening 15 minutes.
Skilful wing play on 43 minutes by David Pereira Da Costa was finished off by Sotoca who had ghosted in at the back post for a free header.
Six minutes into the second half, VAR spotted a handball against Lyon captain Maxence Caqueret and Wahi dispatched the spot-kick to put Lens in control.
Lyon finished a man down after Ainsley Maitland-Niles was given a red card for a professional foul. Moments later Danso headed in the third from a corner in the 87th minute.
Metz picked up three points with a 2-0 win at Nantes, through two second-half goals in two minutes from Georges Mikautadze, from the spot, and Matthieu Udol.
Lorient escaped the relegation play-off spot by downing Breton rivals Rennes 2-1 thanks to Mohamed Bamba and an Eli Kroupi strike on 90 minutes, before Amine Gouiri struck back for the hosts deep in injury time.
Montpellier came from behind twice to draw 2-2 with visiting Strasbourg. A brace from Arnaud Nordin cancelled out Mouhamadou Diarra’s penalty and an Emanuel Emegha goal.
The results mean Montpellier dropped to 16th after Lorient’s win and only have a three-point buffer between themselves and Metz in the automatic relegation zone.

Nadal, who has won 22 Grand Slam titles, added that the future of Spanish tennis was in good hands with the 20-year-old. Alcaraz has already won majors at the US Open and Wimbledon and is ranked number two in the world.
“It’s a good thing that as a player I will not face him many times,” said Nadal, who expects to retire in 2024 after a series of injuries limited his appearances on the circuit. “As a fan, I will enjoy watching him for many years hopefully. In Spain, we should be very, very happy about having someone like Carlos coming. He’s an amazing player. He’s only 20-years-old and he’s already won two Grand Slams and a couple of important tournaments.”

After Real Madrid drew in Valencia the night before, surprising title challengers Girona had a chance to reverse their recent slump and regain some ground.
But they continued to subside as they lost 1-0 at Mallorca.
That gave giant Catalan rivals Barcelona a chance to take second, but they drew 0-0 against Athletic Bilbao in the late game.
Girona remained second, seven points behind Real with Barcelona another point behind.
Atletico Madrid tightened their grip on fourth as they beat Real Betis 2-1.
In Palma on Sunday, Mallorca, fresh from reaching the Copa del Rey final, scored the only goal after 33 minutes.
Following a corner, the ball rebounded off Mallorca’s Cyle Larin and fell to Jose-Manuel Copete in space less than 10 metres out. The defender smashed a shot in off the underside of the bar.
Girona enjoyed a slight edge in possession but struggled to create clear-cut chances as they failed to score for the third time in five games.
“I am disappointed with the result but not with the team’s attitude,” said Girona coach Michel Sanchez.
The victory pulled Mallorca up to 15th, eight points clear of the relegation places.
Barcelona ended their visit to Bilbao playing out an uneventful goalless draw at walking pace.
“We didn’t play a good game, we didn’t attack well,” said coach Xavi.  “We didn’t play our best. The match required more from us. It’s a missed opportunity. The team could have done more.”
Barcelona also suffered potentially costly injuries to Frenkie de Jong and Pedri, who went off in tears.
Bilbao, who also reached the Spanish Cup final in midweek, stayed fifth, five points behind Atletico, the only team that stated the weekend in the top half of the table to win.
In the afternoon, Atletico took the lead against Betis after eight minutes with help from the visitors.
Memphis Depay drove a cross toward Alvaro Morata, lurking at the far post, but the ball never reached the Spain striker as three Betis players combined to put the ball into their own net.
Hector Bellerin scuffed the ball onto team-mate German Pezzella who deflected it toward the line where goalkeeper Rui Silva could only parry it into his own goal.
Rui Silva brought down Morata to concede a 27th minute penalty but the goalkeeper saved the spot kick and two follow-up attempts by Morata.
Morata found the target in the 43rd minute, nodding in a rebound from close range after Rui Silva saved a shot by Rodrigo de Paul.
“It was a deserved victory,” said Atletico coach Diego Simeone.  “We needed it.”
William Carvalho pulled one back for Betis with a long-range blast after 62 minutes.
Goalkeeper Jan Oblak pushed a shot from Guido Rodriguez onto the post as Atletico absorbed late Betis pressure.
In the day’s opening game, Alexander Sorloth scored a hat-trick as Villarreal crushed struggling Granada 5-1.

9,Shanaka guides Sri Lanka to dramatic T20 win over Bangladesh,Batsman Jaker Ali took Bangladesh close with his maiden fifty before Shanaka ended his 34-ball innings of 68 with the third ball of the last over.,"

SRI LANKAN captain Charith Asalanka plays a lofted shot during the first T20 International against Bangladesh at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Monday.—AFP

 
SYLHET: Dasun Shanaka held his nerve under pressure to take two wickets in the final over, snatching a dramatic three-run win for Sri Lanka in the opening Twenty20 International of a three-match series against Bangladesh in Sylhet on Monday.
Set a target of 207 runs, lower middle-order batsman Jaker Ali took Bangladesh close with his maiden fifty before Shanaka ended his 34-ball innings of 68 with the third ball of the last over.
Shoriful Islam hit a four from the next ball, leaving Bangladesh requiring six from their last two balls.
But the hosts could manage only two runs to be restricted to 203-8, with Shanaka, who also dismissed Rishad Hossain in the first ball of the final over, finishing with 2-36.
Former skipper Angelo Mathews claimed 2-17 to inflict some early damage on the Bangladesh innings before veteran Mahmudullah Riyad struck 54 off 31 balls to revive the hopes of the home side.
Sadeera Samarawickrama and Kusal Mendis earlier slammed a fifty each to guide Sri Lanka to 206-3 after Bangladesh sent them in.
Samarawickrama struck an unbeaten 61 off 48 balls after Mendis hit 59 off 36 balls as the visitors overcame a slow start to put up an imposing total.
Stand-in skipper Charith Asalanka played his part with an unbeaten 44 from 21 balls.
Mendis and Samarawickrama shared 96 runs for the third wicket after Sri Lanka lost their first two wickets for 37 runs.
Shoriful removed Avishka Fernando for four with the second ball of the innings before Taskin Ahmed had Kamindu Mendis caught by Soumya Sarkar at midwicket for 19.
Mendis hit leg-spinner Rishad for a four and two sixes off consecutive balls to race to his fifty off 27 balls.
Rishad returned for his next spell to exact revenge as Mahmudullah took a well-judged catch at long off boundary to end the innings of Mendis.
Asalanka joined Samarawickrama to continue the assault, adding 73 for the unbroken fourth wicket, including 24 runs from the last over of the innings bowled by Mustafizur Rahman.
The series marks the start of Sri Lanka’s month-long tour of Bangladesh, which also includes three One-day Internationals and two Tests.

10,HBL PSL 2024: Shadab stars as United topple Zalmi to revive campaign,"The fire was lit by none other than their captain Shadab Khan, illuminating the night up both with the bat and the ball as United toppled Peshawar Zalmi.","RAWALPINDI: It was freezing cold here at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Monday night. Although the capacity crowds had kept the stands dense enough to arrange for the much-needed warmth, it was Islamabad United, dressed in their bright red home colours, who turned on the heat on their homecoming.
The fire was lit by none other than their captain Shadab Khan, illuminating the night up both with the bat and the ball as United toppled Peshawar Zalmi by 29 runs in the HBL Pakistan Super League match, reigniting their hopes of making it to the play-offs as they rose to third in the standings.
The best Zalmi could offer was a firefighting effort, led by Aamer Jamal’s brilliant half century, a show of his resilience and ability after Shadab’s 80 off 51 balls had boosted Islamabad to 196-4. But Aamer fought all alone before becoming one of Shadab’s three victims 
Zalmi were in trouble from the word go, as they lost their destructive opening pair of Babar Azam and Saim Ayub in the first over. While Babar was run out on the non-striker’s end thanks to an underarm throw by Alex Hales, Saim was undone by Naseem Shah’s pace as an inside edge off his gloves onto his thigh pad flew to forward-lunging Salman Ali Agha at first slip.
It got worse for Zalmi when first drop Mohammad Haris chipped Rumman Raees to Imad Wasim at short fine leg. And the Peshawar outfit were absolutely shattered when an athletic effort by wicket-keeper Azam Khan saw off Tom Kohler-Cadmore and an easy catch by Faheem Ashraf at square-leg dismissed Rovman Powell — both wickets coming in pacer Hunain Shah’s share.
By the end of the powerplay, the scorecard read 18-5.
A counterpunching effort by Aamer and Paul Walter, which saw the pair take on the Islamabad bowlers for a few boundaries and a six – battered by Aamer over square-leg off Faheem — took Zalmi to 59-5 at halfway stage.
Aamer launched Shadab down the ground and over deep midwicket for his second and third sixes in the 11th over, inducing hope of a mighty comeback within the Zalmi camp.
The right-hander brou­ght up his half century in 27 balls, when he dragged Naseem off his legs in the 13th over. Aamer clobbered Rum­man straight and long for another six and Walter drove the bowler in the same direction for four to add 19 runs to the total in the next over.
Needing 85 from the last six overs, Aamer and Walter had to go all out now. And throwing the bat and everything did not help as only 13 runs came in the next two overs, with latter giving his wicket away to Shadab.
As the equation got tighter with each ball, even two gorgeous sixes by Aamer (87 off 49) against Shadab did not help Zalmi’s fate as the latter went on to castle the former before destructing the stumps of the incoming Mohammad Zeeshan to effectively wrap up the proceedings. 
It looked like a belter of a surface when Islamabad batted earlier, as they plundered the Peshawar bowlers with ease. Despite a shaky start, Shadab’s captain’s knock of 80 off 51 balls, which featured four fours and six sixes, put the home side on track. Later on, unbeaten cameos by Jordan Cox (26 off 20) and Azam Khan (29 off 14) further hurt Zalmi. 
Better known for his exploits with the bat, Saim struck for Zalmi on the very first ball of the match, stunning Islamabad opener Hales with a carom ball that straightened from length. 
The off-spinner then forced a skier off Hales’ opening partner Colin Munro for Babar to take an easy catch in the circle before a fightback of sorts by Shadab and Salman took the team to 46-2 by the end of the powerplay.
The fightback continued as Shadab clobbered pacer Aamer for perfectly-timed hit for six in the next over while Salman punished leg-spinner Arif Yaqoob for bowling short, scoring two boundaries in the ninth.
After Shadab had taken fast bowler Walter on for his third maximum, Salman danced down the ground to clear extra cover off Arif as Islamabad cruised to 88-2 at halfway stage.
The 65-run partnership, which had come off 44 balls, was broken when Salman’s (37 off 25) attempt to scoop pacer Salman Irshad saw the ball end up in the hands of wicket-keeper Haris after taking a feather edge off the right-hander’s bat.
Shadab kept going on, lifting Arif straight down the ground for another six and reached his half century in 34 balls, edging Luke Wood behind for a boundary in the 13th over.
Having driven Salman Irshad down the ground to start off his innings, the incoming Cox slashed at pacer Zeeshan’s bounce for a four and a six in the 14th before Shadab dispatched Aamer for two more sixes. 
The former Pakistan vice-captain chipped a Salman Irshad yorker past short fine leg for four more to bring up Islamabad’s 150 in the 16th over, before finally falling in the next over when he holed Wood out to Saim at deep midwicket.
Azam Khan took it on from there, bludgeoning Salman Irshad and Aamer for three fours and a handsome, straight six off the latter. He drove Salman Irshad down the ground for another four as Islamabad posted a total more than enough to bring their campaign back on track.

11,Green may focus on red ball cricket before India Tests,Green said the red ball preparation had helped set him up for his match-winning 174 not out in the Wellington opener.,"MELBOURNE: All-rounder Cameron Green may be spared white ball duties for Australia to focus on his red ball game ahead of the Test series against India in the next home summer, coach Andrew McDonald said.
Green played Sheffield Shield cricket with Western Australia in the run-up to the ongoing New Zealand Test series and said the red ball preparation had helped set him up for his match-winning 174 not out in the Wellington opener.
McDonald said Green may be given a similar lead-in to the five-test series against India and be rested from scheduled ODIs and T20Is against Pakistan that start the home summer.
“I’d like to probably err on the side of preparing him through red ball. We know how good a white-ball player he is so you put a priority on what it looks like next summer,” McDonald told reporters.
“The white-ball cricket’s important, but that test summer’s important, so I think with the results he’s had [at Wellington] he’ll probably come to us and say, ‘Can you give us a couple of Shield games before the first Test against India?’”
Australia beat the Black Caps by 172 runs at the Basin Reserve, the margin of victory almost matching Green’s first-innings knock, which was the second hundred of his Test career.
Green followed up his century with a vital 34 as Australia were skittled for 164 in their second innings.
Wellington cemented Green’s ownership of the number four slot long held by one of the nation’s greatest batters in Steve Smith, who now opens the batting with Usman Khawaja following the retirement of David Warner from the format.
Green’s stocks have risen as team-mate Marnus Labus­chagne’s have plummeted, the number three’s struggles laid bare in Wellington where he managed a total of three runs.
Once scoring centuries for fun, Labuschagne has not surpassed 10 runs in his past six Test innings.
Ahead of the second and final New Zealand Test starting in Christchurch on Friday, McDonald said there was no great concern with Labus­chagne’s form so long as his team mates were pulling the weight.
“We want the top six, seven batters to be performing as a collective,” he said. “Can he perform better? No doubt about that. Does he know that? He knows that.
“Over time there’s going to be ebbs and flows in your career.”

12,No Wagner recall as Sears picked for second Australia Test,New Zealand coach Gary Stead says selectors had gone for a “like-for-like” replacement for O’Rourke in picking Sears.,"WELLINGTON: Uncapped Wellington fast bowler Ben Sears will replace Will O’Rourke in New Zealand’s squad for the second Test against Australia, quashing fans’ hopes of a Neil Wagner recall.
O’Rourke was ruled out of the Christchurch match starting on Friday with a hamstring injury, raising speculation fan favourite Wagner might come out of retirement to help the Black Caps square the series.
New Zealand coach Gary Stead poured cold water on that, saying selectors had gone for a  “like-for-like” replacement for O’Rourke in picking Sears, who has an average of 27.03 in 19 first-class matches.
“We wanted someone with some genuine pace. Ben’s done that. He’s had recent international success against Australia as well which was part of the decision-making and in going with him as the replacement for Will,” Stead told reporters on Monday.
“Neil had a fitting send-off last night with the team. They celebrated everything he’s done, and Neil was happy with the decision of where he’s got to around that as well.”
Opener Devon Conway, who was ruled out of the first Test with a fractured thumb, will also miss the second test along with a large chunk of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he recovers from surgery.
The Chennai Super Kings batter should return for the IPL in May and be fit for the T20 World Cup starting in the Caribbean and the United States in June.
New Zealand were thrashed by 172 runs within four days in the first Test at Wellington on Sunday, having opted for an all-seam attack on a wicket that proved conducive to spin.
Australia spinner Nathan Lyon had a 10-wicket haul at the Basin Reserve, while New Zealand all-rounder Glenn Phillips took five second innings wickets with his part-time off-spin, having not been given a bowl in the first innings.
New Zealand selectors were criticised for snubbing spin-bowling all-rounder Mitch Santner in favour of the fourth seamer Scott Kuggeleijn, having also overlooked Santner for the second Test in Hamilton against South Africa.
The hosts got away with it against the second-string Proteas, claiming a seven-wicket win, but there was no hiding behind the result in Wellington.
Stead admitted selectors had misread the Basin Reserve pitch.
“Yes, it is [a concern]. Yeah, definitely,” he said. “If we knew it was going to spin, not so much the spin but more the bounce, then Santner would have played. So yeah, we got that wrong.
“Put our hand up around that as well. It’s not what we expected, not what we’ve seen from the Basin Reserve in the past either.”
