0,PTI to knock SC door after losing reserved seats,ECP turns down SIC plea for not submitting list for reserved seats on time; commission to distribute vacant seats proportionally among other parties.,"• ECP turns down SIC plea as party didn’t submit list for reserved seats on time
• Commission to distribute vacant seats proportionally among other parties; one member dissents
• Nomination papers of Zardari, Achakzai accepted
• PTI rejects decision as ‘unconstitutional, against democracy’; wants Senate, presidential polls postponed
ISLAMABAD: After the Election Commission of Pa­k­istan decided against the allocation of reserved seats to the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for “having non-curable legal defects and violation of mandatory provision of submission of the party list for reserved seats”, the PTI decided to approach the Supreme Court against the 4-1 decision of the election watchdog.
The announcement of the decision coincided with the acceptance of nomination papers of ruling coalition-backed PPP candidate Asif Ali Zardari and PTI-backed PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the upcoming presidential elections, set to take place on March 9.The final list of all eligible candidates will be released on March 5, though nominees can withdraw from the race until March 6.
In a 22-page judgement reserved last week, the ECP on Monday said that in light of clear provisions of Article 51(6), read with Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017, the SIC was not entitled to claim for the quota for reserved seats.
The commission also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP appearing to be major beneficiaries if the decision was not reversed by the apex court. “The seats in the National Assembly shall not remain vacant and will be allocated by proportional representation process of political parties on the basis of seats won by political parties. [The] office is directed to calculate the quota accordingly.”
Though there is no clarity on the seat-sharing formula, the distribution would prove particularly tricky in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) where the PTI-backed independents had clinched 91 out of the total 115 general seats while none of the other political parties could reach the double-digit.
ECP member dissents
The ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, however, differed with the idea of distributing the seats among different political parties.
In his dissenting note, Mr Bharwana said he agreed to the extent that the reserved seats could not be allocated to the SIC since the party failed to submit its priority in time — a basic requirement of the law — and noted it cannot be submitted at a later stage after the conduct of elections. He opined that the seats should remain vacant till the amendment to Article 51(6-d) and Article 106(3-c). These articles state the reserved seats will be allocated to the political parties on the basis of their total number of general seats in the national and provincial assemblies.
The ECP order said though the SIC was a registered political party with the commission having its electoral symbol, it did not participate in the general election as a registered political party. It may be noted SIC leader Hamid Raza contested polls as an independent candidate. The ECP order said the SIC did not submit the list to the commission which meant that it was not interested in contesting polls as a political party nor did it want the reserved seats.
It also referred to the argument advanced by the SIC counsel who cited the example of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) regarding the allocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly in 2019, saying the counsel failed to provide any document in support of his arguments.
According to the ECP, it is clearly stated in Article 51(6) of the Constitution that the seats will be allocated to the political parties which contested the election and won general seats in the assembly and the seats reserved for women and non-Muslims will be allocated on the basis of a proportional representation system.
The order also referred to the Supreme Court jud­g­e­ment which stressed that the “negative language used in a statute where it reposes a statutory duty on a public official means that the provision was mandatory even if no penalty is prescribed for it”.
It added that Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 stipulates that for the purpose of allocation of reser­ved seats, a political party shall within the period fixed by the commission file a separate list for reserved seats.
PTI reaction
The PTI demanded the resignation of the ECP chi­ef and its members and rej­ected the decision as un­co­nstitutional and a stab in the heart of democracy.
It also demanded the postponement of the upcoming election of the president and the Senate till the outcome of the plea they planned to file in the apex court. Speaking in the upper house of parliament, PTI leader Senator Syed Ali Zafar said there was no room in the Constitution for the elections with an incomplete electoral college.
Minutes after the ECP’s decision, Senator Zafar said the PTI would not accept the result of the presidential and Senate elections if these were held before the decision of the apex court.
He said all elections in an incomplete house were illegal.
“We understand that the election of prime minister was also unconstitutional,” he said.
“This is the last assault on the heart of democracy,” Senator Zafar said while rejecting the decision of the ECP.
The PTI leader said that under Article 51(6)(d) of the Constitution, the ECP has to allocate reserved seats to any political party on the basis of its proportional strength of general seats in the national and provincial assemblies.

1,Rivals in agreement on judicial probes into thorny issues,"Bilawal endorses PTI call for inquiry into May 9; PTI-backed MNAs suggest investigation into alleged rigging, cipher issue.","• Bilawal endorses PTI call for inquiry into May 9; PTI-backed MNAs suggest investigation into alleged rigging, cipher issue
• Speaker intervenes after opposition riled up by PPP chief’s remarks
ISLAMABAD: Amidst fiery spee­ches, the National Assembly on Mon­­day witnessed a glimmer of hope as members sitting on the opposition and treasury benches seemed to find common ground over the formation of judicial commissions on a number of tho­r­ny issues, including alleged rigging in the Feb 8 elections, the incidents of May 9 and the cipher controversy.
While Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari endorsed the demand of PTI-backed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to hold a judicial inquiry into the May 9 incidents, PTI-backed members came up with suggestions to form commissions to probe the alleged rigging in the general elections and the cipher case, in which former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had been convicted.
PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif also attended the sitting for a brief period before taking oath as the country’s new prime minister and attentively listened to the points raised by the members in their speeches.
The house witnessed noisy protests from opposition members over certain remarks of Mr Bhutto-Zardari and MQM’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. A couple of times, the protesting members from both sides came so close to each other that Speaker Ayaz Sadiq — fearing a physical scuffle — directed the lawmakers to keep their distance and remain confined within their benches to avoid any untoward situation.
 






“You may continue to protest, even against me, but please avoid contact with each other as it can create [an unpleasant] situation,” said the speaker.
At one point, PTI members, who had been listening to Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s speech with patience, gathered in front of the speaker’s dais and staged a noisy protest when the PPP chairman told them “to go to hell” instead of giving lectures on the Constitution and democracy, and later called them “cartoons”. The issue, however, was settled when Mr Bhutto-Zardari himself asked the speaker to expunge his remarks, stating that he should not have uttered those words.
Quorum
The newly-constituted National Assembly also saw the first adjournment of the proceedings due to a lack of quorum, which was pointed out by PPP’s Shagufta Juamani in a bid to to block the speech of firebrand PTI MNA Sher Afzal Marwat.
Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah, who was presiding over the sitting at that time, adjourned the sitting till Friday evening, without even ordering a headcount as the quorum, for which the presence of 84 lawmakers is required in the 336-member house, was visibly lacking.
Raid on Achakzai’s house
The day’s proceedings started with the protest by PTI’s Omer Ayub over the blackout of the opposition’s speeches in the assembly in the media and the police raid at the Quetta residence of PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who is also the opposition’s candidate against PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari in the upcoming presidential election.
Mr Achakzai, in his own speech, said that his house had been raided due to his speech in the National Assembly in which he had criticised the establishment’s role in politics and rigging in the elections.
In his speech, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that he would ask Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, belonging to his own party, to enquire the matter, stating that this incident was making the upcoming presidential election controversial.
Judicial commissions
In his nearly hour-long speech, Mr Bhutto-Zardari welcomed Shehbaz Sharif’s offer for a “charter of national reconciliation and charter of economy” and “appealed” to the opposition to participate in the process.
“My advice to our colleagues would be to support us, at least where the economy is concerned,” he added. He said no single party had the mandate to make decisions on its own and the people of Pakistan had made a decision that compelled the parties to work together.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari stressed the need for carrying out judicial and electoral reforms, admitting that the PPP and the PML-N had not been able to make judicial reforms despite agreeing in the 2006 Charter of Democra­­cy. He asked the opposition “to sit with us over these two issues.”
The PPP chairman said that his party endorsed the demand of the KP chief minister to form a judicial commission to investigate the May 9 incidents on the condition that the “decision will be acceptable to all.
The PPP, he said, appealed to the prime minister to approach Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to head the judicial commission on May 9 so that the perpetrators are punished and the innocents were released.
The PPP leader also extended support to the PTI regarding the latter’s demand for a probe into election irregularities.
Referring to the cipher case, he said every copy of the alleged cipher sent to the government by the then ambassador in the US in 2022 was accounted for, except for the one that was with the Prime Minister House. He said Imran Khan himself admitted on TV that he had lost a confidential and national security document of the government.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari, who was the country’s foreign minister at that time, said the enemy of Pakistan could crack the code which was mentioned in the cipher, and thus decipher all other ciphers.
He said the US intelligence agencies had raided the house of ex-president Trump to retrieve some confidential papers and filed a case against him.
Moreover, he said that a day after Imran Khan’s arrest, the alleged cipher was printed in an international publication.
“If you think that the people of Pakistan are fools, then you are wrong”, he said, adding: “We all know that the alleged copy of the cipher was printed in an international publication for the sake of politics and to make the corruption cases controversial in this manner.”
The PPP chairman regretted that the two past governments of Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan failed to devolve the ministries that had to be transferred to the provinces by 2015 under the 18th Constitution Amendment.
He said bureaucrats sitting in the capital had been telling the rulers at the Centre that the federal government was left with nothing after giving money through the NFC Award to the provinces.
Opposition speeches
PTI MNA and former speaker Asad Qaiser in his fiery and emotional speech while condemning the raid on Mr Achakzai’s residence, declared that they did not fear such actions.
“I want to make this clear that time of fear has passed. We have come out of all situations headstrong”, he declared amid desk-thumping by the opposition members.
Mr Qaiser demanded that a judicial commission should be constituted by the SC on the cipher controversy, alleging that the judge had given the verdict against Imran Khan on gunpoint.
The former speaker further stated that a judicial commission should be formed to probe allegations of rigging in the Feb 8 polls.

PRESIDENT Arif Alvi administers the oath to newly sworn-in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the President House, on Monday.—White Star

ISLAMABAD / PESHA­WAR: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was administered oath to the coveted office of the country’s chief executive by President Arif Alvi in a ceremony at the President House, in which KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Ganda­pur was conspicuous by his absence amid allegations of election rigging by his party, the PTI.
Soon after assuming charge of his office, PM Shehbaz chaired a meeting on matters related to the economy and ordered talks with the IMF for an extended facility. He was briefed by the finance secretary on the occasion. He also ordered tax refunds worth Rs65 billion.
As the younger Sharif was sworn in to his second term on Monday, the ceremony was witnessed by the caretaker PM and ministers, CMs, governors, chairman of joint chiefs of staff and diplomats.
In addition to the state and foreign envoys, political leaders, including PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif and PPP leaders Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto-Zar­dari, were also present.
After taking oath, Shehbaz Sharif arrived at the PM House where he was presented a guard of honour, followed by the introduction with the PM House staffers. Caretaker PM Anwarul Haq Kakar was also presented with a farewell guard of honour.
Oath-taking amid protests
The oath-taking cerem­ony was held amid protests by the PTI and other opposition parties, including former PML-N ally JUI-F, which claimed that the election results were manipulated to favour the PML-N and other ruling parties.
Since the start of the National Assembly session last week, the PTI-backed lawmakers, who joined the Sunni Ittehand Council (SIC) have been protesting and disrupting the house proceedings. They are claiming that the lower house of parliament was ‘incomplete’ without the reserved seats of the SIC and all proceedings were “illegal”.
Against the backdrop of this protest, PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur, who was elected to the KP CM post, skipped the oath-taking ceremony and instead attended the provincial assembly session.
CM Gandapur told reporters on the premises of the KP Assembly that he did not think it was appropriate to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the premier. “It is still not clear whether the prime minister has been elected by the people or by the returning officers,” he said in a reference to alleged discrepencies in Forms-45 and Forms-47.

World leaders congratulate Shehbaz
After becoming the PM, Shehbaz Sharif also received felicitations from some world leaders, including China.
A spokesperson of the China’s foreign ministry said that under the leadership of newly-elected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the new government, Pakistan could achieve a greater accomplishment in the cause of national development.
“We believe that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz and the new administration, Pakistan can achieve a greater agreement in nation building, “ Mao Ning said during her regular briefing in response to a question asked by a reporter.
President Recep Tayyip Erd­ogan of Turkiye called PM Shehbaz and congratulated him on his election as the country’s chief executive. The prime minister expressed his gratitude to President Erdogan for his “gracious gesture of brotherhood and fraternity”.
 






He underlined that “enduring people-to-people bonds, and strong religious and cultural linkages underpinned a robust Pakistan-Turkiye relationship”.
PM Shehbaz also conveyed that Pakistan looked forward to welcoming President Erdogan for the session of Pak-Turkiye High-Level Strategic Coopera­tion Council (HLSCC), scheduled to be held in Islamabad soon.
They also exchanged views on the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and reaffirmed their commitment for a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian question anchored in international law and in line with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Organi­sation of Islamic Cooperation.
Prime Minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim also congratulated Shehbaz Sharif on assuming the charge of his office. PM Shehbaz Sharif thanked his Malaysian counterpart, saying that Pakistan and Malaysia had a “long-standing brotherly relationship”. Highlighting the close and cordial relations between Pakistan and Malaysia, he underscored the importance of regular high-level exchanges to ensure a robust bilateral cooperation.
Both leaders agreed to work closely to further strengthen the existing ties and also took stock of regional developments, particularly the situation in Gaza. The prime minister extended an invitation to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to visit Pakistan, which he accepted.

3,PTA head summoned to clarify position on audio leak,His counsel denies that the regulatory body had given any permission for call interception.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday summoned the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman in the audio leak case, after his counsel denied that the regulatory body had given any permission for call interception.
The case is related to the petitions filed by Najam Saqib, the son of former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, and Bushra Bibi, the spouse of former prime minister Imran Khan.
Both the petitioners challenged the inquiries initiated against them on the basis of an alleged audio leak, which went viral on the social media before being broadcast in the national media.
When Justice Babar Sattar of the IHC resumed the hearing, the directors general of Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) were in attendance.
Appearing before the bench, Advocate Irfan Qadir representing the PTA chairman informed the court that his client was in official visit to Bar­celona and would return in three to four days.
While the PTA official had earlier informed the court that there was a provision of call interception in the legal framework, Adv­ocate Qadir apprised the court that the PTA did not give permission for this.
Noting the authority’s in­consistent statements in the case, Justice Sattar qu­e­stioned the authenticity of the PTA’s earlier submissions and whether the chairman had complied with the court order to submit an affidavit clarifying their position.
The judge then summoned the PTA chairman to appear in person before the court on March 14.
The IHC also asked the IB DG Fuad Asadullah to explain the procedure for legal interception and inquired about the measures to protect the privacy of citizens. “Are telecom operators allowed phone tapping?” Justice Sattar questioned. He remarked that telecom operators would have to respond to this issue.
The IB DG said the prime responsibility of the intelligence agencies was to keep a check on enemies of state. However, he requested the judge to hear the details in chamber.
The court later adjourned the proceedings till March 14.

4,Senator withdraws resolution to ban social media,Senate passes resolution against massacre of Palestinians during aid delivery.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Bahramand Khan Tangi withdrew his resolution seeking a blanket ban on major social media platforms in the country to “save the young generation from their negative and devastating effects”.
The resolution, which became controversial even before coming to the house, recommended to the government to put a ban on Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube.
It was widely criticised shortly after it emerged on the house agenda, by digital rights activists and journalists who said the move was aimed at further curbing freedom of expression in Pakistan. The development came at a time when the country was already facing disruption to the services of X following allegations of rigging in February 8 polls.
The resolution was supposed to be moved by PPP Senator Bahramand Khan Tangi, who was expelled by the party last month for remaining silent in a Senate session that passed a controversial resolution seeking to delay February 8 polls due to security concerns. However, the Senate Secretariat’s record shows that Mr Tangi is still a senator of PPP.

Senate passes resolution against massacre of Palestinians during aid delivery

Even after the withdrawal of the resolution, many members wanted to speak on it, but the chair disallowed.
Speaking on a point of public importance, Senator Saifullah Abro of PTI termed the resolution an attack on the youth and wondered how it was made part of the agenda. He said the attempt to suppress the voice of the youth had been made by a man who had supported the resolution proposing postponement of elections.
Palestinians’ massacre
Separately, the house unanimously passed a resolution showing serious concerns over brutal attack of Israeli army on “innocent and unarmed” Palestinians who had gathered to received aid, including food supplies and medicine.
“This House strongly recommends and urges international community to take action such that the siege of Gaza be lifted immediately and Muslims countries be allowed all access and cover for delivery of aid,” read the resolution, moved by all members of the Senate.
Speaking on the resolution, lawmakers suggested a ban on products manufactured by the Israeli companies. One of the Senators proposed a protest by the members of the house in front of the US embassy and the European Commission.

5,PkMAP holds rally against raid on Achakzai’s home in Quetta,PTI condemns Sunday night’s action by district administration.," 

Mahmood Khan Achakzai

QUETTA: Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) on Monday held a rally against the raid on the residence of its chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and announced a shutterdown strike today (Tuesday).
PTI, which has named Mr Achakzai as its presidential candidate, also condemned Sunday night’s action.
The Quetta district administration claimed to have recovered a piece of government-owned land, “illegally occupied” by the PkMAP chairman, during the raid.
PkMAP leaders and supporters have dismissed the claims and held a rally in Quetta to protest against the raid.
The lawyers’ community also observed a strike and did not appear in district courts as a protest.

PTI condemns Sunday night’s action by district administration

A large number of workers and supporters, carrying party flags, placards and banners, participated in the rally, which was led by PkMAP central leaders Dr Hamid Khan Achakzai, Lala Rauf and Abdul Qahar Wadan.
The participants gathered at the Bacha Khan Chowk, where the party leaders addressed the crowd.
They condemned the raid on the residence of Mr Acha­k­zai and claimed he was targeted for his last week’s speech in the National Assembly.
They added that Mr Achakzai is a presidential candidate and deserves presidential protocol instead of raids on his residence.
The party leaders denied the administration’s claim that Mr Achakzai had illegally occupied government land.
They claimed that the land was legally allotted and claimed to have complete documentation.
PkMAP leaders claimed that the district administration wanted “to shed blood”, but the restraint shown by the party foiled the conspiracy.
PTI condmens raid
While talking to the media outside the Parliament House on Monday, PTI leader Ali Muhammad Khan also condemned the raid on Mr Achakzai’s home.
He said his party is supporting the PkMAP chief as its candidate for president to eliminate the establishment’s role in politics.
Politics should be left to politicians, the PTI leader said.
“The nation and PTI stand by the armed forces, but we have a stance that the country should be run as per the Constitution,” the PTI leader said, adding that Mr Achakzai also has the same stance.
“The country’s issues should be addressed in the parliament. Imran Khan and Mahmood Khan Achakzai have been saying this,” Mr Khan said, and claimed that in the past Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari also said this, but “they have changed their narratives”.
Last week, PTI announced support for Mr Achakzai to contest the upco­ming presidential election on March 9 against PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari.
The nomination came only a day after the Baloch nationalist leader delivered a forceful speech in the National Assembly against the alleged role of the military establishment in politics and in support of the jailed PTI founder, Imran Khan.
With Mr Achakzai by his side outside the Parliament House, Mr Khan said Pakistan’s issues should be addressed through a debate inside parliament.
While replying to a question about the PTI founder’s derogatory remarks against Mr Achakzai in the past, the PTI leader said if political parties move in circles, 250 million people will suffer.
Mr Khan claimed that the PTI will hold talks with other political parties if they agree with its narrative.
He added that during his party’s government from 2018 to 2022, Imran Khan made Asad Qaiser the National Assembly speaker.
“Now Imran Khan has decided to nominate a person from Balochistan [Mr Achakzai] as a presidential candidate. It will send a message to the people of the province that they are not worthless,” he said.
He said PTI disagreed with Mr Achakzai in the past but has supported him in eliminating the establishment’s role in politics.
