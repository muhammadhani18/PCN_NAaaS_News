0,KP Assembly okays Rs159 billion for govt’s March expenditure,Opposition objects to move insisting CM is not govt.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Monday approved Rs159 billion funds for the provincial government’s expenditure for the current month.
On Oct 26 last year, the then caretaker government unveiled its Rs529.11 billion spending plan from November to February.
The caretaker cabinet was de-notified on March 1, a day after the expiry of those four months, without the authorisation of the spending of the provincial government.
Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur presented the expenditure for one month in a sitting chaired by Speaker Babar Salim Swati.

The house also passed a resolution declaring the assembly a polling station for the March 9 presidential election.
The CM tabled a resolution for the approval of “grants and authentication of the schedule of authorised expenditure” in accordance with provisions of Article 123 of the Constitution regarding the government’s expenditure.
He read out the resolution and authenticated the authorisation of over Rs159 billion in respect of the estimated expenditure in relation to the affairs of the government from March 1 to March 31, 2024.
The current expenditure includes over Rs23 billion for tehsil government salaries, over Rs3 billion for tehsil government non-salary, Rs19 billion for health, over Rs8 billion for police, over Rs12 billion for pensions, over Rs10 billion for subsidies, over 1 billion for local government, over Rs1.5 billion for Zakat and Ushr, over Rs1.6 billion for public health engineering, over 1 billion for roads, highways, bridges, building and structure repair, and over Rs3 billion for higher education, archives, and libraries.
Over Rs231 million was approved for the provincial assembly, over Rs675 million for general administration, over Rs461 million for finance, treasury, and local fund audits, and over Rs1 billion for the administration of justice.
The opposition members raised questions about the approval of the budget in absence of the provincial cabinet.
“We request you not to bulldoze the Constitution. The chief minister is not the government. This act of his is unconstitutional,” Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Ahmad Kundi said.
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz member Dr Ibadullah said why an unconstitutional way was adopted to do something that could be managed constitutionally.
“What if only two members of the provincial cabinet are announced and the cabinet members approve the expenditure in a day or two,” he said.
However, Treasury member Akbar Ayub insisted that the assembly was more powerful than the cabinet so it could approve the government’s expenditures, and that happened in Punjab as well.
He added that the chief minister headed the government, so basically, he was the government.
Former speaker of the provincial assembly and current MPA Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani said a new conspiracy was being hatched to deprive the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf of the due assembly seats reserved for women and religious minorities.
“We should not be forced to protest outside the premises of the Election Commission of Pakistan and the National Assembly,” he said.
The speaker said the matter was sub-judice, so the house should not discuss it.
The assembly later adopted another resolution declaring its hall as the polling station for the presidential election to be held on March 9.
Assembly Speaker Babar Salim Swati prorogued the session afterward.
Later, Mr Kundi of the PPPP told Dawn that the Sunni Ittehad Council members of the KP Assembly voted for the expenditure of Rs159 billion for March, which was an unconstitutional act as, without the approval of the cabinet, the “vote on account” could not be tabled in any assembly.
“At the moment, the cabinet [in KP] is awaited. Only the chief minister has taken the oath of office,” he said.

2,Residents seek early construction of bulwarks in Chitral,CHITRAL: The residents of Chitral have demanded of the provincial government to immediately start work on the...,"CHITRAL: The residents of Chitral have demanded of the provincial government to immediately start work on the proposed project of constructing bulwarks against the floods to protect the vulnerable villages from inundation. They regretted that the departments concerned often executed the projects in the months of May and June when water level in rivers and streams rose significantly, thus failing to serve the purpose of protecting villages from flood devastation.
They said that various government departments, including irrigation, communication and works, tehsil municipal administrations and local government constructed the embankments.
Former tehsil nazim Sartaj Ahmed Khan said that the ideal time for raising the bulwarks was from the month of November to March as water level in the rivers plunged to the lowest possible level during this period.
He said that swollen rivers inundated the low-lying villages every summer, washing away agricultural lands, roads and suspension bridges.
Mr Ahmed said that departments concerned approved tens of projects of building protection walls every year, but they were often executed in the months of May and June when the water level tended to rise significantly making it difficult to complete the projects as per the specifications.
The former tehsil nazim said that the main Chitral-Booni Road could not be saved from flood damage despite millions of rupees were spent to stop landslides in the Reshun village of Upper Chitral district two years ago. He said the reason was that work on the embankments started in June.
The former nazim regretted that due to the failure of the bulwark project, not only the road eroded into the river but more than 14 families were also rendered homeless as they lost their houses.
He urged the planning and development department to release the funds for the proposed project as early as possible so that work on the protection walls could be started during the current month. He said that delayed release of funds was the major reason behind the inordinate delay in commencement of work on bulwarks.

He said that all financial support under the Shahada Package would be extended to the family of Ijaz Khan.
The CM said that his government’s second priority would be poverty alleviation, welfare of the vulnerable segments of society, and resolution of the unemployment issue.
He said that the current financial issues had badly hit the common man, so they should be addressed on an urgent basis.

4,Frequent traffic snarls plague Torkham Highway,"Transporters complain of long delay in completion of customs terminal, slow goods clearance","

Vehicles stuck in a traffic jam on Peshawar-Torkham Highway at Ali Masjid, Khyber tribal district. — Dawn

 
KHYBER: Frequent traffic snarls have been reported on the Peshawar-Torkham Highway to the inconvenience of travellers with customs clearing agents and transporters blaming them on a long delay in the completion of the customs terminal at Torkham, slow goods clearance, and the traffic police’s “ineptitude.”
The National Logistic Cell (NLC) has repeatedly promised the operationalisation of the customs terminal by December 2023 with a parking facility for at least 500 vehicles.
The NLC officials told Dawn that the terminal would have all modern facilities for speedy electronic scanning and a customs clearance system in order to provide maximum relief to transporters and traders alike while minimising traffic congestion on the road leading to the Torkham border.
Customs clearing agents and transporters alleged that while the NLC had yet to come up with an explanation for the delay in the completion of work on the terminal, the customs officials, too, were showing no urgency in rectifying their obsolete system of goods clearance, troubling them.

Transporters complain of long delay in completion of customs terminal, slow goods clearance

Torkham Customs Clearing Agents Association president Aimal Shinwari told reporters at the Landi Kotal District Press Club on Monday that the “prolonged and undue” delay in the clearance of export goods as well as the mismanagement of heavy traffic by traffic police cost the exchequer heavily, besides seriously affecting the country’s trade with Afghanistan.
He said both exporters and importers were at a loss to understand why customs officials were delaying the clearance of vehicles loaded with Afghan transit goods as little time was required to fulfil the formality.
Gulat Shinwari, another customs clearing agent, argued that while it took a vehicle carrying goods three days to reach Peshawar from Karachi, the same was stopped at the Torkham highway for over a week by the traffic police on the pretext of no parking space at the Torkham customs offices.
On the other hand, transporters accused traffic police of asking them for money to get permission to go to the Torkham border point out of turn.
Sherin Jan, a transport driver, told Dawn that the traffic police would allow only those drivers who paid them.
He said the sought-after money ranged from Rs5,000 to Rs15,000 depending on the urgency of the transporter’s need to take merchandise across the border to ensure the goods’ delivery to the destination in Afghanistan.
Adeel Khan, a shopkeeper in Peshawar’s Karkhano Market, alleged that the Khyber traffic police allowed double parking on the main road for vehicles loaded with goods, leaving little road space for “safe” movement.
He alleged that traffic police mostly allowed loaded vehicles to use the wrong side of the road at Ali Masjid point, causing the road to be blocked for several hours due to the oncoming traffic as well.
Head of traffic police for the main highway wasn’t available on his mobile phone despite repeated calls.

The protesters asked the senior officers of Peshawar Electric Supply Company and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited serving in Kohat to leave the district over their failure to ensure smooth supply of utilities.
Earlier, a number of women had staged a protest in Chakar Kot area against the outages. They ended the agitation after the administration officials promised to ensure uninterrupted power and gas supply, but to no avail.
Pir Shah Nawaz, a representative of Junglekhel welfare society, said Kohat was a gas-producing area, but its residents were subjected to excessive outages.
He added Tarebla and Warsak dams produced cheap hydel electric power at Rs2 per unit, but people of the province were charged Rs60 per unit, which was a grave injustice to them.
The protesters said they had the first right over the gas discovered in the region.
They also blasted Pesco for sending them inflated power bills despite carrying out 18 to 20 hours of loadshedding.
Meanwhile, a separate protest rally was held in the Zargran Bazaar square led by chairman of Grand Businessmen Alliance Ameer Khan Afridi.
The protesters said water supply was disrupted due to excessive power outages, creating its shortage.
On the occasion, Mr Afridi said they had taken up the matter with the Pesco executive engineer, but he did not take corrective measures.
ARRESTED: The police foiled an attempt to smuggle hashish from Orakzai tribal district to southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through the Indus Highway by arresting two carriers in Jarma area here Monday.
Jarma SHO Saada Khan said a team stopped a van near the model town and recovered 11 kilogrammes of hashish hidden in its secret cavities.
He said two smugglers, identified as Sair Shah of Junglekhel and Riaz hailing from Muhammadzai area were arrested. He said a case was registered against them under the Control of Narcotic Substances Act.
He said later the two were produced in a court, which remanded them to police for further investigation.

8,"Death toll from rain, snowfall surges to 36 in KP",PDMA says 25 of deceased are children.,"PESHAWAR: Death toll from the recent devastating rains and snowfall across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa surged to 36 on Monday, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said. It added that 43 people were injured in disaster.
The authority said 25 of the deceased and 22 injured were children.

Separately, a child died and his mother was injured as roof of their house collapsed due to heavy rain in Gaji village of Gadoon Amazai in Swabi district on Sunday night. Residents retrieved the injured and the body from the debris and shifted them to hospital.
The PDMA said 46 houses were destroyed and 346 partially damaged. It said the local authorities were distributing compensation cheques among the affected families.

PDMA says 25 of deceased are children

It said Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur had directed the authorities to take immediate steps to reopen the blocked roads.
In Bajaur, the authorities decided to launch a damage assessment survey on Tuesday (today) in order to pay compensation to the owners of destroyed or damaged houses.
Officials said the decision to launch the survey was taken at a meeting of the district administration and PDMA chaired by deputy commissioner Mohammad Anwarul Haq.
The officials told Dawn that the respective tehsildars in all the seven tehsils would lead the survey teams.
Sources in the district administration said at least 120 houses were either destroyed or damaged in Bajaur.
Meanwhile, elders and political activists in Kalam area of Swat on Monday refuted the claims of the district administration that it had restored vehicular traffic on the Bahrain-Kalam and other link roads.
Speaking to reporters at the Swat Press Club, Malakand Peace Jirga chairman Rehmat Din Siddiqui, former tehsil nazim Habibullah Saqib, former Kalam nazim Malik Hasan Zeb and Malik Ghulam Ali flayed the district administration for failing to reopen the roads, blocked by heavy snowfall.
The elders insisted there was no truth in the district administration’s claims that roads had been cleared of snow.
They said the roads had been closed for last four days, troubling both the residents and tourists from different parts of the country.
They said there were no arrangements to transport patients to hospitals. They asked Malakand commissioner, Swat deputy commissioner and other relevant officials to take practical steps to restore roads to traffic instead of making ‘verbal claims’ on media.
The elders said the relevant departments should clear the main Madyan-Bahrain-Kalam highway and all other link roads of snow so food and medicines could be transported to the local markets.
They warned of taking to streets if the roads were not cleared immediately.

11,Anomalies detected in selection of medicines for government hospitals,DG health rejects report,"PESHAWAR: The medicines and disposable items to be purchased for public sector hospitals next year will cost 900 per cent more than what the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government spent for them last year, according to a report of the health department.
However, provincial director-general (health services), Dr Shaukat Ali claimed that irregularities didn’t take place in the selection of medicines and that such claims were just “propaganda of vested interest.”
He told Dawn that he rejected the report regarding the purchase of low-quality drugs at inflated prices as the process of selecting drugs was better than last year’s.
A sent by the health department’s Medicines Coordination Council (MCC) to the government regarding the prices of approved drugs shows a huge difference in the prices of drugs purchased last year and to be purchased in the current year.

DG health rejects report

It added that the medicine costs would go up from Rs5 billion to Rs44.584 billion rendering it difficult for the newly-elected government to afford them.
“Every year, the government purchases drugs for its around 2,500 health centres in the province. As a result, the health facilities will procure fewer drugs and other items in their allocated budget, and the availability of lifesaving medicines will haunt patients throughout the year. Patients will be ultimate sufferers,” it read.
The DGHS, which is currently in the process of drug procurement, selected 351 drugs from the MCC formulary list under a “pre-defined master plan.”
The report said the directorate made tailor-made tendering criteria for the “blue-eyed bidders and ended up procuring low-quality goods at very high prices,” according to the report.
Previously, 800 drugs were purchased for the entire year for the same amount.
If compared with the current year approved MCC rates, the rates in the last five years, especially the previous year, are almost 900 per cent higher, causing a huge loss to the government, the report said.
The report also carried a detailed comparative summary of the goods selected for 2022-23 and 2023-24.
It said 351 items were being purchased at higher prices than last year’s, and they included intravenous cannulas, X-ray films, catheters, gauze cloth, nasal oxygen cannulas, disposable spine needles, cotton, antibiotics, painkillers, drips, and anti-snake venom.
The report said this year, the department started procurement very late due to financial issues in the province, and Rs5 billion was allocated for four months from March to June 2024 but next year, the government had to allocate over Rs44 billion to procure items for the whole year.
Last month, the DGHS, through the health secretary, wrote to the finance department that a lack of drugs in the government’s hospitals could create a law-and-order situation, and so it desperately required Rs9 billion to ensure the availability of drugs.
The report said a “tailored” technical evaluation criteria was adopted that not only led to selection of poor-quality items but also that the rates approved were extremely exorbitant, even if compared with the approved prices of other procurement entities throughout the country and with the last five year procurement records of the government, MCC, medical teaching institutions, and primary, secondary, and tertiary care hospitals in Punjab.
It added that the government should investigate the matter as high-ups were involved in it.
DG Health Dr Shaukat Ali rejected the report regarding the purchase of low-quality drugs at higher prices and said that they had completed the entire process of drug selection better than last year.
