0,Army top brass slams politically-motivated drive to blur May 9 riots,Commanders dismayed at ‘unsubstantiated allegations’ of interference in electoral process,"Top military commanders reiterated their commitment on Tuesday that planners, instigators, abettors, perpetrators and desecrators of martyrs’ monuments and attackers of military installations on May 9, 2023 would certainly be brought to justice under the relevant provisions of the law and Constitution.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement the Corps Commanders’ Conference noted with concern the spread of organised misinformation and fake news by certain nefarious elements to sow despondency and divisions within the society.
The meeting, held at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir in the chair, urged the proud people of Pakistan to remain positive and united and wholeheartedly participate in the progress and development of the country.
“Malicious efforts to create distortions, confusion and disinformation are absolutely futile and only part of an organised campaign being launched for narrow political interests, to blur the abhorrent activities that took place,” the ISPR said in a statement.
The participants of the conference, according to the media wing of the military, affirmed that the Pakistan Army would continue defending and serving the nation in every possible way in the journey towards enduring stability, prosperity and security.
The forum noted that the armed forces of Pakistan, at great peril to their primary responsibility, provided a security environment for the conduct of the general election 2024 as per the given mandate, and had nothing to do with the electoral process.
However, the forum expressed dismay that some vested small segments of polity and media, especially social media, had been maligning the armed forces with unsubstantiated allegations of interference which was highly deplorable.
“It’s unfortunate that rather than focusing on real issues such as good governance, economic recovery, political stability and public wellbeing, the entire focus of such vested elements is on creating political instability and uncertainty by attempting to scapegoat others for their own failings,” the statement said.
The Corps Commanders’ Conference emphasised that due legal processes should be followed with evidence and proof rather than resorting to unconstitutional and uncalled-for baseless political rhetoric and emotional outbursts.
The forum noted with satisfaction the smooth democratic transition of power at the Centre and in the provinces. The participants hoped that the post-election environment would bring in the desired political and economic stability, resulting in peace and prosperity for the people of Pakistan.
The forum strongly believed that democratic consolidation was the way forward for the country, the ISPR said. It affirmed that military leadership was cognisant of the full spectrum of the challenges and threats and it remains committed to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.
The forum reiterated its commitment to continue providing full support to the government in combating security threats and uplifting the socio-economic development of the country, including wholehearted assistance in curbing all illegal activities, including smuggling, hoarding, electricity theft, implementation of one document regime and respectable and safe repatriation of all illegal foreigners.
The military leadership paid rich tributes to the supreme sacrifices of the martyrs, including officers and men of the armed forces, law-enforcement agencies and the citizens, who laid down their lives for ensuring peace and stability in the country.
The forum resolved that the terrorists and their facilitators, working at the behest of hostile forces to destabilise Pakistan, would be dealt with with full might of the state, the ISPR said, adding that the army chief directed commanders to continue consolidating gains of efforts against terrorism and militancy.
The forum expressed concerns over the continued repression of the Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and condemned the unabated human rights violations by India. The forum reaffirmed that Pakistan would continue to support the Kashmiris politically, diplomatically and morally at all levels.
The forum also expressed complete solidarity with the people of Palestine and condemned serious human rights violations and war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza. “The Palestinian people have unequivocal diplomatic, moral and political support of the Pakistani nation and we will continue to support the principled stance of our brethren for enduring resolution of the Palestinian issue,” COAS said.
The forum appreciated the efforts of civil administration, law-enforcement agencies and security forces for providing all-out assistance during the general elections in the light of the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) guidelines for creating a safe and secure environment for the electoral process, despite overwhelming odds.
The army chief asked the field commanders to continue maintaining high standards of professionalism, operational preparedness and motivation during operations and achieving excellence during training of the formations.

1,Blome optimistic about new govt's IMF ability,Cautions economic stability hinges on economic policies over next few months,"US Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome has expressed confidence in the incoming government's ability to pull off the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme but cautioned that economic stability hinged on the economic policies over the next few months.
While speaking to a gathering of select journalists at the US Consulate General in Karachi, he said collaborating with the new government would be a top priority.
“And our belief is it will take a concerted effort to ensure it moves in the right direction. If Pakistan maintains a consistent commitment to economic reforms, those reforms will build certainty and confidence for investors and enable economic growth fuelled by sustainable, inclusive, and …. economic development,” the US diplomat said.
“We are confident Pakistan can do this and break free from an over-reliance on unsustainable debt,” he added.
“We want to see Pakistan succeed in attracting more trade and investment, especially US investment. The economic success of Pakistan and its people remains a top priority for us, and we will continue to partner with Pakistan through a wide range of avenues, including technical engagement, and development assistance, and continue to strengthen our trade and investment relationship,” he said.
He said real and lasting stability depended on governments and citizens finding a way to work together to expand opportunity and unlock the enormous talents of its people.
The US diplomat further noted that Pakistan was the largest export market and the US sees huge potential for increasing two-way trade and investment between our two countries, and it's been a major priority for me as ambassador.
“More than 80 US companies operate in Pakistan right now, making the United States one of Pakistan's leading investors. And we saw about $250 million in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from the US alone in FY22.”
“US companies offer Pakistanis high-paying, 21st-century jobs, training, skill development, and labour protections, and many of these companies also give back generously to their local communities through a variety of corporate social responsibility programmes in which many – US companies are pioneers.
And over the years, our top companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars here and employ hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis in great jobs.”
“And we want to see more US investment flow into Pakistan. We all know the upsides, as I've just mentioned – cutting-edge technology, high-skills training, employment of Pakistanis in leading-edge type of jobs,” he added.
“Pakistan has made good progress confronting serious economic challenges during the past six months by successfully implementing the current IMF programme. It remains vulnerable to shocks such as Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, devastating floods, and trade disruptions such as current events in the Red Sea, but continued progress on key reforms can help buoy the economy,” he said.
He said governments cannot grow the economy by themselves to prosper in the 21st century, stating, “You must grow from the bottom up, allowing people to unlock their talents through private enterprise, economic freedom, and action.”
“So, to anyone who might doubt the durability of the US-Pakistan relationship, I would – I generally point to the long-term investments that we've been making since the start of our relationship, investments in the Pakistani people and their future,” he said.
Blome stressed that Pakistan has to find ways to look where it can be competitive in US markets and there are many possibilities that traditionally of course have been focused on textile and a few other sectors, “but you know the US economy and the level of US imports is enormous and there's a huge room for growth in trade relationship”.
“We will continue to look for ways to help ensure Pakistan, the Pakistani companies have opportunities.”
He said firms will look for opportunities to invest in Pakistan as they have in the past. There's an enormous mutual benefit to be had and expanding this, important trade in economic relationship remains between both countries, which is tested over time.
Speaking about volatility and the shift of the local businesses, he said there are a number of issues and concerns to international investors including volatility or inconsistency and policies where they are looking. However, it hasn't meant that there's been a large exodus of existing investors.
He said he saw cases of investment deferred rather than cancelled because of some watchfulness of government’s policy.
He said during the last two years, the pattern of strong capital shifts investment flows that have been moving from place to place particularly trying to respond to supply chain disruptions or potential supply chain disruptions and things like that as companies are going to diversify suppliers.
He said any Pakistani government should be looking at carefully in terms of prioritising.
He expressed Pakistan's desire to draw external Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and highlighted the need for a proactive approach in competing with other nations to attract such investments into the country.
Blome noted that any Pakistani government today faces a challenging environment with a very difficult debt situation, adding that one of the necessary tasks for any government is to find ways to raise the revenues required to meet its payment obligations.
He highlighted that fiscal reforms on energy allow it to get its budget back in balance and reduce reliance on external borrowing which is becoming more difficult to get so all of those things will create a healthier Pakistani environment in general, particularly the economic environment.
“We've revived some of our high-level economic dialogues including a ministerial level. We're looking for ways to unlock some of those issues in our two-way trade and of course, have a robust assistance programme for Pakistan in terms of economic growth.""
""At the end of the day, I think. We see it as a strong national interest of the US for Pakistan to be stable and prosperous.""
""We want to help Pakistan succeed in this challenging time and I think we're committed to finding ways. More areas can be expanded. We put a renewed emphasis on nutrition and maternal health, which obviously became a more acute crisis in the wake of the floods in 2022. So there's a lot of areas where we are re-evaluating and refocusing I think it's still a process.” he said.
He mentioned that the IMF functions based on policy guidelines established by its board, which includes the US and various other countries. Despite some misconceptions about behind-the-scenes manipulation, it operates with a professional staff, he clarified.
Regarding the Green Alliance Initiative, US Ambassador Donald Blome stated that through the USA and technical assistance, they are exploring ways to catalyze and expedite the energy transition in collaboration with Pakistan.
“Look at what the bilateral mutual interests are between our two countries to put the relationship on a sustainable path that addresses what our future-looking priorities are for both countries. This area of what we've come to call the Green Alliance framework covers a lot of those things that we see as priorities in our going-to-be priorities for Pakistan. So that includes energy transition to renewable which will be hugely beneficial for Pakistan while reducing its reliance on expensive fuel,” he said.

2,"PML-N, PPP benefit from ‘SIC-claimed’ seats",PTI gives protest call against ECP decision to deprive party of its rightful share,"After rejecting the request of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for reserved seats, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has started the process of allotting them to other parliamentary parties.
According to the notifications issued by the commission, three reserved seats for minorities in the National Assembly each have been distributed among the PML-N, PPP and JUI-F.
Similarly, three reserved seats for minorities in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly have been allotted to the PML-N, PPP and JUI-F each.
The ECP has also issued a notification about the allotment of reserved seats for women in the Sindh Assembly.
PPP’s Sumeta Afzal Syed and MQM-P’s Fouzia Hameed have been allotted reserved seats for women.
Likewise, Sadhumal Surendar Valasai of the PPP has been allotted a reserved seat for minorities in the Sindh Assembly.
Sources said the allotment of other reserved seats would be carried out soon.
A day earlier, the ECP’s last year’s decision to strip the PTI of its election symbol came back to haunt the former ruling party once again. The polls oversight authority refused to allocate reserved seats to the SIC -- which comprises PTI backed lawmakers -- just because it had not submitted a “priority list” for them prior to polls. However, the PTI on Tuesday announced a nationwide protest against the ECP scheduled for March 10 (Sunday) in response to its decision to deprive the SIC of the reserved seats and their allocation to the PML-N and PPP instead.
Addressing the media outside Adiala Jail where PTI founding chairman Imran Khan is incarcerated, party leaders including Sher Afzal Marwat, Shandana Gulzar, Atif Khan, and Shehryar Afridi announced their dissatisfaction with the ECP's ruling.
They accused the commission of diverting the mandate given to the PTI by the voters to its rival parties, particularly the PML-N and PPP.

The leaders argued that the allocation of reserved seats to other parties contradicted the will of the people who had voted for the PTI. They claimed that the ECP's decision was a blatant misuse of power and announced their intention to hold a nationwide protest against this alleged “injustice”.
The PTI leaders further criticised the state of Pakistan's economy, highlighting its dependence on foreign remittances and accusing the Sharif family of sending their wealth abroad. They claimed that with the support of overseas Pakistanis, the country could generate quick revenue, emphasising the need for a change in leadership.
In a bold move, the leaders demanded that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conduct an audit of the election process. They also challenged the legitimacy of the Shehbaz Sharif government, suggesting that if it was deemed legitimate, it should be granted loans.
Addressing the imprisonment of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, the leaders claimed that she was being kept in solitary confinement. They maintained that Imran’ss refusal to make any deals and his determination to stay in jail for seven years.
Sher Afzal Marwat highlighted the opposition's unity in protests, promising a historic demonstration against the ECP in K-P, with himself leading the protest in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
The ECP had deprived the PTI of its popular electoral symbol—the cricket bat—on December 22, 2023 in view of irregularities in its intra-party polls. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court on January 13, weeks before the February 8 general elections.
Due to the absence of an electoral symbol, the PTI had become ineligible to submit its priority list for reserved seats to the ECP while its candidates had to contest the last month’s elections as independents.
As independent candidates have to join a political party three days after the announcement of official election results, the PTI-backed candidates joined little-known SIC.
However, the SIC had neither applied for any reserved seat to the ECP -- a requirement under the law -- nor had it filed a priority list of candidates before the elections. The SIC later approached the ECP for allocation of reserved seats in proportion to its general seats in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures. A five-member ECP bench led by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja last week reserved its order on the petition after hearing the arguments.
On Monday, the commission unveiled its order stating that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats for women and minorities “due to having the non-curable legal defects and violation of mandatory provision of submission of priority list for reserved seats which is the requirement of law”.

3,Bilawal backs PTI call for judicial probe into May 9 events,PPP chief says people elected lawmakers not to abuse each other but to resolve their issues,"The first formal discussion in the National Assembly on Monday brought attacks on the civil and military institutions, missing cipher, rigging, judicial and electoral reforms in the spotlight with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, while endorsing the PTI’s demand of a judicial inquiry into May 9,2023 events questioned former prime minister Imran Khan’s role in the cipher case.
Surprisingly, the PPP chairman, while validating Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s demand of a judicial inquiry into May 9 events, urged newly-elected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to approach the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to head the would-be judicial commission so that the perpetrators were punished.
However, the former foreign minister endorsed the demand on the condition if the PTI assured that the decision made by the judicial commission was accepted by all, saying it could not be that the country forgets that its institutions and memorials of martyrs were attacked.
On May 9, PTI-backed workers and supporters allegedly attacked and vandalised state institutions, buildings and military installations after Imran was arrested from the Islamabad High Court premises in a corruption case. Declaring May 9 as ‘black day’, the army said the day would be remembered as a dark chapter as the “group wearing a political cloak” had done what the enemies could not do in 75 years, all “in the lust for power”.
“The politics of the country will not be able to progress until we address this issue,” Bilawal told the National Assembly. Due to this reason, he added, the PPP appeals to the prime minister to approach Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to head a judicial commission on May 9 so that the perpetrators are punished.
Bilawal, recalling his grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s words that he would take the secrets of the country to his grave but never compromise on the national security, said that Imran Khan himself admitted that he lost a confidential copy of national security document – the cipher – asserting that it amounted to comprising the national security of Pakistan.
Condemning the comparison between Bhutto and Imran, Bilawal said that had Imran himself not accepted it on television that he lost his copy, then one would consider the opposition’s excuse that the responsibility lies solely with the bureaucrats.
“Imran Khan himself admitted that he lost a confidential, national security document of the government of Pakistan, which is encrypted,” Bilawal said, adding that the enemy of Pakistan could crack the code of the country and break into all the other ciphers. “As the prime minister of Pakistan,” he said, “Imran Khan was privy to this.”
Recalling how Imran had said that ‘politics was to be played’ over cipher issue, Bilawal said that the alleged cipher was printed in an international publication the day after Imran Khan’s arrest. “If you think that the people of Pakistan are fool, then you are wrong,” Bilawal said. He said that everyone knew that the alleged copy of the cipher was printed in an international publication for the sake of politics and to make the corruption cases controversial in this manner.
“When such a document is publicised in an international publication,” he said, “it amounts to comprising the national security of Pakistan,” adding that this was condemnable and should be pursued in accordance with the law.
Reminding that everyone should abide by the oath, Bilawal said that “those violating the Constitution should be punished,” adding that “the Constitution was violated when the house was dissolved during the no-confidence motion”.
Responding to the criticism and protest by the PTI-backed lawmakers, Bilawal said that if he was schooled over the Constitution and the democracy by them, all he would say is, “who the hell are you to talk to me?
He continued: “I am the grandson of the man, who accepted being sent to the gallows, but did not compromise on his principles, those who are protesting today have only recently started talking about the democracy and the Constitution. They are in no position to give us a lecture on these matters.”
“The people of Pakistan are sending us the message that they are done with our squabbles. Hence, be it the ‘Charter of National Reconciliation’ or the ‘Charter of Economy’, we have to engage with one another,” Bilawal stressed.
“If the opposition truly represents the people, then it should realise that they [people]are fed up with the crippling inflation and economic difficulties. They have not voted for their representatives to only abuse each other and make needless hue and cry. The people of Pakistan have voted solely for us to save them from the economic quandary,” the PPP chairman asserted.
Bilawal said that the manner in which the members of the house were conducting themselves under the garb of protest during the speeches of the prime minister and the opposition leader, was disappointing. Noting that the opposition leader raised the objection that his speech was not aired on PTV, Bilawal said that this trend, was initiated by Imran Khan, but it should no longer continue and the speeches of the members should be aired live.
In a veiled reference to Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s speech the other day where he demanded that the establishment shouldn’t have any role in politics, Bilawal said that no matter how many resolutions were passed to stop interference in the democratic system, “we cannot attain this motive until politicians do not respect one another and operate within” their constitutional domain. “We should not expect the judiciary and other institutions to work within their constitutional boundaries if we do not respect them ourselves,” he said.
Bilawal said that the PPP did not reach the assembly due to forms 45 and 47, but because of the blood and sweat of the workers of the party. “We can solve most of the country’s issues if we make a system in which everyone agrees to the rules of the game and the code of conduct,” he proposed.
The PPP chairman said that the people of Pakistan “hope for us to derive solutions to their problems, so it is imperative that we carry out” judicial and electoral reforms. “We have not been able to make judicial reforms since the Charter of Democracy, and we would like to invite our fellows from the opposition to sit with us over these two issues,” he said. “If we address these two issues related to the judiciary and the elections, then no power in the world can weaken democracy of Pakistan.”
Meanwhile, PTI-backed lawmaker Asad Qaiser said that that time of fear had passed as the PTI had come out of all situations headstrong, adding that neither his leader Imran Khan nor the party would bow down.
Qaiser also demanded that the Supreme Court constituted a judicial commission on the cipher issue, which led the PTI to claim that its government was ousted on foreign interference. He regretted that cipher was used as the basis for Imran’s conviction and punishment.
Qaiser also demanded a judicial commission to probe allegations of rigging in the general elections. In addition, he vowed to bring everyone together for the Constitution and civilian supremacy as well as for an independent judiciary.
Speaking on the session, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that the prime minister’s election was a sad occasion for democracy, adding that no one had imagined that such a person would be elected.
Gohar, while assailing the PPP and the PML-N for dynastic politics, said that Bilawal had buried his grandfather’s politics. He claimed that Imran brought an end to dynastic politics and was the reason why a worker like himself was appointed as the PTI chairman and standing in the National Assembly.

4,PM gives nod to IMF talks for long-term bail out,Chairs meeting of core economic team immediately after taking oath," 
Getting down to business straightaway, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif gave the green signal on Monday to begin negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new long-term bailout package.
His one of the first decisions after taking oath of the 24th prime minister, was to further strengthen the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and winding up or selling the loss-making enterprises.Shehbaz chaired his maiden meeting on precarious financial situation with his core economic team, taking stock of the discussions with the IMF.
He also directed for preparing a roadmap on war footing to deal with the current situation.The suspicious absence from Shehbaz’s core economic team was former four-time finance minister Senator Ishaq Dar.
The new, but an anticipated, inclusion in the team was Muhammad Aurengzeb, currently President of the Habib Bank Limited.Aurengzeb is expected to be inducted as a special assistant to the prime minister. Aurengzeb is a foreign nationality holder and doesn’t currently have the Pakistani nationality, which was a hurdle in his way to becoming a federal minister.
He belongs to Punjab’s Ramdey family and is considered close to Shehbaz.Among his core teams were Senator Musadiq Malik, former MNA Ali Pervaiz and deputy chairman Planning Commission Dr Jehanzeb Khan. Shehbaz had also included Ali Pervaiz in his core team in April 2022, but he was not brought to the table.
The huddle suggests that Shehbaz Sharif is keen to pick a new economic team instead of relying on experienced hands. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman, Finance secretary and Planning secretary were also part of this core economic group.
Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal briefed the prime minister about the current fiscal situation, implementation status on nearly two and a half dozen IMF conditions for the second review of the IMF and the likely IMF demands for the new programme.Bosal informed the meeting that this fiscal year’s budget deficit would exceed the IMF agreed target.
One participant also highlighted the issue of shortfall in the FBR tax revenues and the need for any additional measures, although the FBR had achieved its eight-month collection target of Rs5.83 trillion.
On the issue of next programme, the prime minister was informed about the likelihood of revenue measures and cut in power subsidies. Shehbaz instructed for immediate advanced discussions with the IMF for the Extend Fund Facility (EFF), according to the press statement by Prime Minister’s Office.
The EFF is a long-term debt instrument that the IMF signs with member states, facing balance of payments and debt repayments crisis. Pakistan needs about $30 billion in the next fiscal year for debt repayments and current account deficit financing. Shehbaz also instructed to reduce the government size.
