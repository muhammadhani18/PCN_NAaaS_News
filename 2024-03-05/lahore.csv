Layyah DPO Asadur Rehman said suspect Hamza Azhar was injured by the gunfire of his accomplices. While returning after retrieving a mobile phone, three accomplices of the suspect opened fire on the police party to rescue Hamza. The suspects managed to escape after the police retaliated. 
The injured suspect, who had been involved in 19 cases of murder, theft, and robbery, was shifted to the DHQ hospital.
A few days earlier, the suspect had assaulted nurse Rimsha, who was returning home after her duty at Layyah DHQ Hospital. The robbers snatched her purse and a mobile phone. Rimsha resisted, prompting the accused to open fire, causing serious injuries.
The DPO visited Rimsha’s family, providing financial assistance and assuring them that the police would soon arrest the culprits.
The DPO confirmed the arrest of the suspects, saying police had set up a women harassment centre and were ready to resolve their issues.

2,Punjab govt repromulgates lapsed price control ordinance,Maryam forms panel to delineate price control paradigm in three weeks.,"LAHORE: The newly-installed political government in Punjab has repromulgated “the Punjab Price Control of Essential Commodities Ordinance 2024” to give legal cover to its administrative machinery in the implementation of price controls as Ramazan is around the corner and formal legislation may take time.
The earlier ordinance had lapsed on Feb 13 creating a void in the government’s powers in controlling prices of essential commodities until Sunday.
In the meantime, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has constituted a committee led by the additional chief secretary having administrative secretaries of law, industries, food, agriculture, livestock and home departments as well as one commissioner and a deputy commissioner as its members.
The committee has been tasked with consulting all stakeholders and presenting a proposal for legislation on whether a full-fledged price control department be established or the ways and means to effectively control essential commodities prices in the province – within three weeks or so.

Maryam forms panel to delineate price control paradigm in three weeks

The Punjab Price Control of Essential Commodities Ordinance 2024 has empowered the secretary industries, deputy commissioners, cane commissioner, director of food and 950 food control magistrates to fix prices of essential commodities; to control artificial price hike and profiteering of essential commodities across the province.
The caretaker government in Punjab had in November last year promulgated this ordinance to empower the provincial government’s machinery, which was earlier drawing powers by adopting the “Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977”.
The Punjab’s ordinance had allowed the government to establish a Price Control Council led by the minister for industries. The council was provided powers to get information of prices, review them and monitor actions taken under the ordinance.
The ordinance had empowered the secretary industries as Provincial Controller General, who may delegate his powers, and deputy commissioners as the controllers of prices and supplies in their respective districts.
PENALTIES: The offences under the ordinance are cognizable and non-bailable.
Any person, who contravenes any order made under the ordinance, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term that may extend to three years but not less than 24 hours, or with a fine which may extend to Rs100,000 or with both.
In case of an offence for the second time after conviction, if convicted again for an offence under the ordinance, shall be punishable with imprisonment not less than one month or with fine not less than Rs45,000 or both.
Punjab Industries, Commerce, Investment and Skills Development Department Secretary Ehsan Bhutta told Dawn that the previous ordinance had lapsed on Feb 13 but the caretaker provincial cabinet’s decision minutes for re-promulgation was received by the department on Feb 24, when the newly formed Punjab Assembly was in session.
 
 

Mr Bhutta said that he along with Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman briefed Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz about the need for the reinforcement of price control powers as well as plans for formal legislation by the Punjab Assembly.
He said the chief minister allowed re-promulgation of the ordinance in the light of the caretaker cabinet’s decision to gain time to prepare for the legislation on the subject in the assembly.
The ordinance, for the first time, had emerged as a provincial legislation, secretary industry made the provincial controller general, introduced Price Control Council, devised a procedure for seizure of commodities and their disposal, summary trial of the offences as well as right of appeal in front of the divisional commissioner and consequently before the price control council.
Mr Bhutta said the committee constituted by the CM and led by the ACS would formulate proposals for the legislation and brief the chief minister in a matter of three weeks or so and then finally present before the new provincial cabinet – currently in the process of constitution – for its nod to take the matter to the Punjab Assembly for legislation.

Ahmadiyya community Hasilpur tehsil President Tahir Iqbal, 54, was on his morning walk in Chak-84 when two motorcyclists stopped him on the road and shot at and injured him. Iqbal died on the spot due to two bullet injuries. 
The police shifted the body to morgue for autopsy and registered a case against unidentified motorcyclists.
An Ahamdiyya community spokesperson said their community was facing hatred in Pakistan. He said the community had been seeking an appropriate action otherwise “this hatred could result in damage beyond repair”. He demanded swift action in this regard.  
“We as members of the Ahmadiyya Community demand that the culprits involved in this heinous act should be punished according to the law and there must be a course of action so that these atrocities can come to a halt,” he said.
Bahawalpur DPO Syed Abbas Shah told Dawn that initial investigation suggested  that the victim was shot dead for an honour-related matter. He said the deceased was a landlord, having an ‘affair’ with a woman of his locality.  
The heirs of the woman, he claimed, had hurled threats of dire consequences several times in the past.

4,Travel on Sukkur-Multan Motorway getting riskier due to bandits attacks,RAHIM YAR KHAN: The Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) from the Guddu interchange to Rohri has become very dangerous for...,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: The Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) from the Guddu interchange to Rohri has become very dangerous for the motorists with rising incidents of attacks by the bandit gangs, raising concerns among the road users about their safety. 
On Feb 27, a gang carried out an armed attack near Ghotki on a doctor’s car who was travelling from Karachi to Multan on the M-5. 
According to Aqsa Asad Khan, she with her husband Dr Asad Iqbal, mother-in-law and three children departed for Multan from Karachi on Feb 27 in their car. Their car entered the M-5 from Rohri after 11pm. When they reached near Ghotki, she was asleep but suddenly woke up due to the armed attack on their car. Due to the firing of the dacoits, the front tyres of their car burst. The robbers’ gang continued firing on the vehicle in which Aqsa received a minor bullet injury. When they felt that their car could not move further, the family, including kids, left it on the road and ran away towards the other side, across the motorway. Aqsa added that they were continuously running along the motorway and waving to the motorists for help but no one stopped to help them. 
When they called the police helpline, the patrol reached after eight minutes and took them to the nearby rest area. Meanwhile, the personnel of the National Highway and Motorway Police (NH&MP), Sindh police and Rangers also arrived there. Aqsa told them that her family wanted to go to their home in Multan and a DSP of Sindh police hired a car for them to facilitate their travel. 
This is not the only incident on this section of the M-5 where the bandits’ attack happened. Ghotki Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran, in a recent press conference, had said the incidents of kidnapping were on the rise and a couple of kidnapping incidents happened during the last one-and-a-half months on the M-5 and the National Highway. He said a truck driver was also kidnapped and incidents of firing on different vehicles were also reported. 
According to some reports, Rahib Shar Gang and Morio Shar Gang are active in the area. About 12 members of these gangs are carrying out criminal activities while in some activities in the Ghotki area, Ameer Ahmed Jagirani Gang and Bhayo Gang were also involved. At some points, the gangs carry out their criminal activities impersonating policemen. 
M-5 Zonal Commander DIG Shahid Javed told Dawn that controlling crime along the motorway and on it was the responsibility of police of the province and district concerned. 
“The NH&MP only controls the traffic and facilitates the motorists regarding traffic rules and laws.” However, he added, the NH&MP was in contact with the Pakistan Rangers and Punjab as well as Sindh police about the criminal activities. He said the motorway police had increased the number of pickets up to 34, including those in the Katcha area in Ghotki and Sukkur where there was a picket every 1,000 meters now. Additionally, seven to eight police vehicles patrolled the areas of the M-5where crime rate was high, Mr Javed added.

5,Plea against Aurat March in Lahore dismissed,LHC dismisses petition by citizen who asked the court to restrain the govt from allowing the march.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday dismissed a petition against the upcoming Aurat March in the city.
Justice Shahid Karim announced a reserved decision on a petition by a citizen, Azam Ali Butt.
The petitioner, through a counsel, submitted that Aurat March had been taking place in Lahore since 2019 with an apparent motive to expose the problems women face in Pakistan.
However, he alleged it had been observed in the past that the march participants indulged in passing indecent comments and social media platforms spread them without any filtration. He pleaded that such activities had been destroying the fabric of society.
The petitioner said brawls occurred in the past between the participants in the Aurat March and the activists of the JI, who organised the “Haya March” on the same day.
He asked the court to restrain the government from allowing Aurat March in light of the alleged controversial placards and banners besides reservations of the general public.

7,"Despite resources, LWMC struggling to keep Lahore clean","Company accused of focusing only major roads, main areas; CEO denies charge","LAHORE: The Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has failed to keep the city clean despite having huge financial, operational and administrative resources.  
The situation seems to be worsening by the day in several localities where the people are facing severe hygiene-related issues due to littering, accumulation of solid waste on roads and non-lifting of waste by the LWMC field operation teams, Dawn has learnt. 
“It seems they (cleanliness teams) are focusing on only the major city roads where the motorists, including the VVIPs, commute on a daily basis. It is really an eyewash as, contrary to the tall claims of the government, the cleanliness teams don’t bother to clear our area of the waste lying in heaps along roads,” deplores Naveed, a resident of Wafaqi Colony — a locality situated near the Canal Road. 
“We complained many times for the removal of waste from our locality on a daily basis but to no avail,” he lamented while lashing out at the LWMC officials and other officers concerned of the Lahore district and divisional administration.  

Company accused of focusing only major roads, main areas; CEO denies charge 

It may be mentioned that the LWMC was established under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance 1984 around 14 years ago, keeping in view the city’s solid waste management system that seemed to be neglected since long due to lack of commitment on the part of the government. The company is formed not for profit under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance. It is governed by a board of directors (BoD), headed by a chairman. The company, through an agreement called SAAMA (Services and Asset Management Agreement), had taken over all the functions and assets of SWM department of the City District Government of Lahore. It aimed at developing an integrated system of solid waste management to ensure efficient collection, transportation, recovery, treatment and disposal of the waste generated in Lahore.  
Talking to Dawn, an official source in the Local Government and Community Development Department, said company never paid much heed to keeping the residential areas clean as its CEOs, who were always posted for a short time after being transferred from the mainstream government portfolios on a deputation basis, preferred major thoroughfares and localities—such as the Mall Road, Canal Road, Jail Road, Multan Road, Lower Mall, Ferozepur Road, Lytton Road, Allama Iqbal Road and main boulevards of major state-owned housing schemes.  
“You know the VIP movement in Lahore always remains on the aforementioned roads, areas etc. So they (the VIPs) feel happy to see these areas clean without knowing about the real facts,” the official, requesting anonymity, added.  
He urged Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to monitor the cleanliness drives, especially her recently launched ‘Suthra Punjab campaign’ very closely to ensure Lahore and other cities were free of waste.  
On the other hand, the people continue to suffer due to various issues related to cleanliness in Lahore.  
“You visit this road (near Ayub Chowk). You will find solid-waste scattered in greenbelts (right and left),” said Yasin, a resident of Johar Town. Similarly, the residents of Mughalpura, Sahuwari, Kotli Peer Abdul Rehman, Dubanpura, Mandi Stop (Multan Road), Ravi Road and others also lodged similar complaints.  
When contacted, LWMC CEO Babar Sahib Din dispelled the impression of focusing the major roads/areas alone and neglecting several other localities.  
“It’s not true that we are focusing on the major parts of the city alone, as we are making entire Lahore parts in our domain clean,” he maintained.  
He said though there are some semi-urban and rural areas of Lahore that remained neglected to some extent, but in the Suthra Punjab campaign, the company is also making efforts to make such areas/localities zero-waste.   
He said a number of private waste loaders/rickshaws were dumping on the roads unlawfully instead of the designated sites.  
Meanwhile, Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa, in a meeting on sanitation, Ramazan package delivery, sewage and encroachments issues, directed the authorities concerned to do all relevant jobs, including cleanliness, efficiently.

8,Man held for acid attack on ex-wife,LAHORE: A man was arrested on Monday for throwing acid at her ex-wife in Multan on March 1.,"LAHORE: A man was arrested on Monday for throwing acid at her ex-wife in Multan on March 1. 
The attack survivor, identified as Misbah Aftab, of Green Town, was at home when she heard someone knocking on the door. 
As she opened the door, her former husband Qari Shaukat with Suleman and Ahmad was standing outside. They hurled a plastic bag filled with acid at her and fled.
Misbah suffered burns on her abdomen and hands and was rushed to hospital.
She told the police that Shaukat had divorced her a few months ago and had been harassing her ever since. She said he had threatened to kill her if she did not reconcile with him.
The police registered a case against the three suspects under the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act 2011 and launched an investigation.
Multan City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Dogar formed a team to arrest the culprits.
On Monday afternoon, the police team nabbed Shaukat from outside the district courts, where he had come to attend a hearing in another case.
The CPO said the police were conducting raids to arrest the other two suspects and assured that the victim would get justice.
Acid attacks are a form of violence against women that are prevalent in Pakistan, where perpetrators often escape punishment due to weak laws and social stigma.
According to the Acid Survivors Foundation, a non-government organisation that works for the rehabilitation of acid attack victims, there were 96 reported cases of acid attacks in Pakistan in 2020, of which 67 involved women.

9,harking back: Brutality of Timur the Lame that Lahore had to face,"As one learns about the unimaginable scale of murders, especially of children, in occupied Palestine by European...","As one learns about the unimaginable scale of murders, especially of children, in occupied Palestine by European Zionists, backed as they are supported by European occupiers of North America who, two centuries earlier, had slaughtered the entire local population, one is reminded of the unparalleled cruelty unleashed in Lahore by Timur the Lame in 1398-99.
This piece needs to be narrated because of the times in which we live. A similar piece was carried almost two years ago but having since read a few descriptions of the 1398-99 events in Lahore, we need to narrate what the Zionists are up to. We should never forget our past if we wish a happy future.
As the Tughluq rulers fought among themselves, finally collapsing, we see in 1396 the forces of the Ghakkar, led by their chief Sheikha Ghakkar and assisted by his son Jasrat, attacked Lahore and in a fierce battle overcame the Tughlaq forces led by Sarang Khan, the governor of Lahore. They carried out considerable murders and got rid of any person seen to be opposed to their rule.  
Barely had the Ghakkars ruled for three years that on the banks of the River Ravi at Lahore stood the forces of the Timur the Lame, so called because he had suffered a leg injury during a battle in Persia (Iran), which he had conquered.  
The Ghakkars decided that it was futile to face such fierce warriors with a massive army of 92,000 horsemen known for their speed and unsparing slaughter.
Before heading for Delhi to take over the capital of India, the forces of Timur were ordered to kill every living being in Lahore. They set aside slaves and young women for the use by their soldiers. Once the women were ‘used’ they were also slaughtered.
For details of these happenings our readers can consult Tarikh-e-Farishta (Vol.1, Briggs), as well as Sharfuddin’s translation of the ‘Zafarnama’.  
This column is focussed on the biggest of the seven holocausts that have hit Lahore. It seems from the descriptions that these Turko-Mongols took some sort of pleasure in these killings.
The killings in Lahore had another gruesome aspect. The soldiers of Timur collected the heads of the hundreds, if not thousands, of people killed, and they were hung on poles which were planted all around the city, as well as along the river banks. The result was that peasants in the countryside would flee on hearing of these warriors approaching.
Never had the city experienced such ferocity. But the worst was yet to come as the massive army headed towards Delhi. All the slaves were tied to ropes. Then news came that soldiers in Delhi were ready to oppose the forces of Timur. At this stage it was decided that all the 100,000 slaves should be slaughtered lest they also rebel. Sharafuddin’s ‘Zafarnama’ and the ‘Mulfazat-i-Taimuri’ both describe this horrible slaughter.
It seems, so it is suggested, that the idea was to scare the defending soldiers at Delhi about what they faced. For miles around every tree had naked people hanging upside down with their necks cut open, or with missing heads. By the time these invading killers reached Delhi on the 10th of December 1398, they found little resistance.
But in keeping with the way these fierce horsemen had conducted themselves the entire population was slaughtered just as they had done in Lahore. After collecting all the gold and jewels and other treasures, Timur headed back. It was clear that he had left behind a reign of terror unheard of before. His Uzbek horsemen and their Turkish cavalry were ordered to kill any human being that they came across.
But Lahore was to suffer much more because of the greed of the Ghakkars. Once Timur left Lahore the Ghakkars found that they could just walk into the city and take over. They hired carts from the countryside and within a week cleared all the bodies by throwing all corpse and heads into the Ravi. One description tells of a ‘Red Ravi’ which R.C. Majumdar, Raychaudhry and Datta describe in some detail.
Timur heard of the Ghakkars taking over Lahore again and sent his grandson Pir Muhammad to take care of matters. Lahore was surrounded and both Shaikha and son Jasrat were captured. To make an example Shaikha Ghakkar was beheaded on the river which flowed outside Mori Gateway. This is the very place where the Hindu Shahi ruler Raja Jaipal committed ‘johar’ after being defeated by Mahmud. The head of Shaikha was paraded in the streets of Lahore.
When it came to Jasrat’s turn it was decided to take him to Samarkand. He had to walk all the way to the Uzbek capital. Once in Samarkand the clever Ghakkar managed to escape and made it back to the Salt Range. There he organised an army of 14,000 horsemen and following the Timurid tactics of speed and vicious killing, started off to recapture Lahore.
Once back in Lahore Timur ordered another massacre, and again heads were put on poles, this time in the field outside Lohari Gate. My view of the location is where today stands Gowalmandi. Timur was not interested in ruling over captured land, but taking away all the gold and wealth once he got back to his home in Otrar in Kazakhstan.
It was in Otrar that Timur died. His body was taken to Samarkand in Uzbekistan, where even today a grand mausoleum named ‘Gur-i-Amir’ can be seen. He remains an admired ruler for Uzbeks.  
There is a description of what exactly did this looter send back or take back. Every Friday a lot of wealth was sent to his home, they are gold, silver, fabrics, kitchen utensils, women, and children slaves. These slaves were then sold in faraway markets and the money taken back to Uzbekistan.
Once Timur had left a devastated Lahore we see the return of Jasrat Ghakkar, who had decided to align with Khusru Khan of Sialkot. But then the Sayyid emperor was also interested in reclaiming Lahore. In January 1422, Sayyid emperor Mubarak Shah returned to Lahore. So Timur’s departure saw two forces interested in Lahore, they being Mubarak Shah and Jasrat Ghakkar.
As the city and the fort had been destroyed, and one account in ‘Tarikh-i-Farishta’ (pg. 164 text) tells us that “as the emperor entered Lahore city, corpses in an advance stage of decay, mostly skeletons, lay strewn in the streets and lanes”. The savagery of Timur was before him to see.
The ‘Tarikh Mubarak Shahi’ tells us that the emperor was very upset and decided to rebuild Lahore. So, the Lahore Fort walls and those of the ancient city were rebuilt in thick mud walls. He also rebuilt the huge fort gates, one of which Akbar the Mughal emperor used when he rebuilt the fort as it stands today.
Mubarak Shah left 2,000 horsemen to guard the newly rebuilt Lahore and returned to Delhi. As soon as he had had left Jasrat Ghakkar returned and camped around the shrine of the Sufi saint Hassain Miran Zanjani at Chah Miran. The recapture of Lahore by Jasrat got Mubarak Shah to send in forces. Jasrat was a tenacious fighter whose aim was to rule Lahore. After every defeat he would rush to the Salt Range, organise a larger army based on the loot that he had collected, and returned stronger.
We know that he faced over 20 battles and won and captured Lahore nine times. As his first impulse was to loot and quickly send the booty back to the Salt Range, where people enjoyed the wealth collected. The fact remains that the Ghakkar forces could never overcome Timur or Mubarak Shah.

11,Court seeks replies on plea to name Shadman Chowk after Bhagat Singh,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday sought replies from provincial and district governments on a petition ...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday sought replies from provincial and district governments on a petition seeking contempt proceedings for not deciding a plea for naming Shadman Chowk after freedom fighter Bhagat Singh who was hanged at the same square by British rulers.
Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation Chairman Imtiaz Rashid Qureshi filed the petition questioning the non-implementation of a 2018 order passed by the court.
Petitioner’s counsel Khalid Zaman Kakar argued that the high court had ordered the respondents to decide, as per law, an application by his client for naming Shadman Chowk after Bhagat Singh.  
He said the respondents failed to comply with the order despite the lapse of six years.
He asked the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the respondents.
Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza sought replies from the chief secretary of Punjab and deputy commissioner of Lahore on the petition by April 26.
In the main petition, the petitioner contended that Bhagat Singh was a freedom fighter of the subcontinent and gave his life along with his companions for the cause. He said Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah had also paid tribute to Singh saying there had never been any such brave person in the subcontinent like Bhagat Singh.
He pleaded that it would be in the interest of justice to name Shadman Chowk after Bhagat Singh and also install a statue of the great freedom fighter at the square as to inspire the people of Pakistan and the world.
He said there were many roads and thoroughfares in neighbouring India named after Muslim rulers like Akbar Road, Shah Jahan Road and Bahadar Shah Road.  
He pointed out that India also published tickets with the image of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of Aligarh University, and his statue was also installed there.

A case registered with Haroonabad City police said that on Feb 15, Salman Liaqat of Ghani Town was on his way home when he found a man identified as Mazhar along with a 13-year-old boy in injured condition near 73/4R Chowk at about 11am.  
The injured people said that Tehsin Nabi, brother of Sub-Inspector (SI) Sila Nabi, had tortured them. 
He went on to say that when Salman shifted the duo to the hospital and tried to enter their name at Saholat Centre, SI Nabi wearing police uniforms along with her brother Tehsin Nabi and sister Naila Nabi stopped Salman for helping the injured. 
Later, when Salman called on 15 and again tried to help the victims, the trio abused and slapped him and threatening him of consequences.  
Police registered a case against the trio under sections 337V, 506 and 341 of the Pakistan Penal Code and started investigations. 
Sharing the CCTV footage of the incident with Dawn, in which the SI along with her siblings could be seen thrashing the man, a police official requesting anonymity said that initially local police refused to register a case against the cop on a written complaint of Salman. Instead, the officials pressurised the complainant to withdraw his complaint. 
The police on Sunday night had to register the case when the CCTV footage of the incident was shared with Bahawalnagar DPO Naseebullah Khan.
