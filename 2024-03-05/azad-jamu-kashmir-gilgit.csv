0,Holy Family revamp misses deadline,Prolonged closure of Rawalpindi’s largest public medical care facility irks patients,"The deadline of February 15 set by the Punjab caretaker government for the completion of the renovation of the garrison city’s largest Holy Family Hospital has been extended till March 31, 2024.
The medical facility was closed on October 25, 2023, due to the renovation work costing Rs3 billion.
Punjab Health Secretary Ali Jan Khan conveyed the new deadline to the C&W Department during a video link meeting.
In light of this extension, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz is now scheduled to inaugurate the project in April. The hospital having 1,052 beds, has been non-operational for four months, leading to an increased patient load at other medical facilities such as Benazir Bhutto General Hospital (BBGU), District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ), and Rawalpindi Institute of Urology and Transplantation (RIUT).
It's noteworthy that the former caretaker chief minister of Punjab, Mohsin Naqvi, had earlier inaugurated the Pediatric and Gynecology Complex in the old block of the hospital on February 2. This newly functional complex has helped alleviate some of the patient burden, a week after its inauguration.
The Medical Superintendent (MS) of Holy Family Hospital, Dr Ijaz Butt, reported the completion of the renovation and revamping project for the old block, which is now designated as the Peads and Gynecology Complex. The project, inaugurated by Mohsin Naqvi, is now fully operational.

Dr Ijaz Butt further explained that the renovation and revamping project for the new block, initially expected to be completed within three weeks, has been extended to ensure 100 per cent completion. Health Secretary Ali Jan Khan directed the C&W Department to meet the new deadline of March 31. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has emphasised the importance of maintaining high-quality standards in the completion of the project.
With Holy Family Hospital set to resume operations, a schedule is being prepared to bring back doctors, nursing staff, and other personnel who were temporarily assigned to other hospitals during the closure. The hospital aims to provide improved facilities and a new look across every ward, department, outpatient department (OPD), and emergency services.
Daily progress reports are being submitted to the competent authority to monitor and track the ongoing work effectively. The reopening of Holy Family Hospital is anticipated to relieve the strain on other medical facilities and enhance healthcare services in the region.

5,Top court allows mulberry trees’ cutting in F-9 Park,"The trees are being chopped to curb spread of pollen allergy, CDA tells apex court","During the hearing of the suo motu notice on the cutting of trees in Islamabad’s F-9 Park, the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday allowed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to cut the mulberry trees.
A three-member bench headed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faez Isa heard the case on Monday.
At the onset of the hearing, the CDA officials told the apex court that mulberry trees were cut in F-9 Park. “Mulberry trees are being cut down to curb the spread of pollen allergies,” they told the court. “Where is the wood of the felled trees?” inquired the CJP. The CDA officials replied: “The wood is taken by the contractor.”
CJP Isa further inquired the CDA counsel about the number of staff employed in the environment department of CDA. The counsel told the court that CDA had 4,500 officers and gardeners.
During the hearing, the chief justice remarked: “If the mulberry trees are so bad, why were they planted?” The CDA officials replied that during the establishment of Islamabad, mulberry seeds were brought from China and thrown into the city by plane. “Eco-friendly trees are being planted instead of mulberries,” they informed the court.
The CJP remarked: “While walking, I wanted to uproot some dry trunks and plant a new tree. However, I was told that only the CDA could do this, not me.”
Environmental affairs expert Raza Bhatti told the court that in China, mulberries were planted in a controlled environment and not in public places.
The court remarked that the CDA staff should ensure their presence at the time of the felling of mulberry trees. “It should be ensured that no tree other than mulberry is cut,” the CJP directed.
The court asked the parties for names and suggestions of experts for appointment as observers within three days. 
The hearing of the case was adjourned indefinitely.

6,Foreign delegates visit ancient Buddhist sites,"Immerse themselves in solemn rituals at Khanpur, Jaulian and Bhamala Stupa","Buddhists and religious leaders from diverse backgrounds, hailing from Malaysia, Sri Lanka, China and other countries, graced the Second International Buddhist Conference held in Pakistan.
As part of their visit, the esteemed delegates embarked on a journey to explore the rich historical heritage, including the renowned archaeological sites of Khanpur, Jaulian and Bhamala Stupa, all of which hold a significant place on the World Heritage List.
Upon arrival at these historical marvels, the foreign delegations, alongside professors from various universities, engaged in solemn religious rites, immersing themselves in the spiritual ambience of these sacred sites. Their visit was not merely one of exploration but also an expression of reverence and admiration for the preservation efforts undertaken in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The delegation members expressed their heartfelt appreciation for the meticulous maintenance and renovation work carried out at the archaeological sites, lauding the dedication and expertise of Dr Abdul Samad, the Director of Archaeology and Museum, and his team.
At the Jaulian Stupa, the guests were warmly welcomed by Field Officer Archaeology Syed Gul Kailash and Site In-charge Raja Adnan, who facilitated an insightful tour, providing detailed explanations about the historical significance of the stupas dating back to the Buddhist era. The delegates, captivated by the intricate details and profound history, expressed keen interest and admiration for the cultural heritage preserved within these ancient structures.
In return for the warm hospitality extended to them, the members of the foreign delegation commended the Pakistani people for their warmth and hospitality, declaring their visit to Pakistan as an unforgettable experience.

Religious tourism
Although the region that is in Pakistan is the birthplace of Buddhism, experts believe that Pakistan has failed to promote a better knowledge of its relative religious tourism strategy and tap its market potential.
Dedicated attention to Buddhist alone sites can place Pakistan on the international tourist map and energise the Buddhist heritage route throughout the Gandhara region.
Pakistan possesses a vast untapped potential for worldwide religious tourism due to its rich heritage and history if adequate security is provided for foreign religious tourists.
Six places in Pakistan have been declared the World Heritage Sites, while twenty-six sites are on the tentative list. The holiest Buddhist religious sites are Taxila and the Buddhist Ruins of Takht-i-Bahi, and the Remains at Sahr-i-Ahlool. These landmarks can market the country as the world’s most popular Buddhist destination, put Pakistan on the international tourism map and revitalise the Buddhist cultural path throughout the entire Gandhara region.
To realise the full potential of religious tourism in Pakistan, a small step in the right direction can translate into a quantum leap tomorrow.
