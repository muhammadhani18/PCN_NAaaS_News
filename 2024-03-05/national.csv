0,PSX soars on PM’s election,"KSE-100 index gains 626.04 points, settles at 65,951.73","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday extended its upward trajectory from the previous week as investors took cue from the election of a new prime minister and upbeat economic data.
In the morning, trading began on a robust note, supported by the shrinking of trade deficit by 30.2% year-on-year (YoY) to $14.87 billion for July-February 2023-24 and the fall in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation to 23.1% in February 2024.
Additionally, foreign fund inflows, rupee stability and the declining Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor) played a key role in maintaining the market’s upward momentum.
Consequently, the KSE-100 index broke the psychological barrier of 66,000 points in the morning, reaching the intra-day high at 66,007.43.
Although the market dipped briefly in the afternoon, touching the intra-day low at 65,532.58, positive sentiment stemming from Shehbaz Sharif’s election as the PM for the second time and the ongoing political developments boosted the index.
The market closed the day near the 66,000 mark with substantial gains, with investor interest being mainly witnessed in the exploration and production (E&P) sector.
“Stocks closed bullish as investors weighed the PM’s election, upbeat data on trade deficit that shrank 30.2% YoY to $14.87 billion for July-February FY24 and CPI inflation that fell to 23.1% for February 2024,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Foreign inflows, rupee stability and falling Kibor played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 626.04 points, or 0.96%, and settled at 65,951.73.
Topline Securities, in its report, said that the KSE-100 index sustained its upward momentum from the previous week. “In a significant political development, Shehbaz Sharif was elected as the prime minister for the second time by the National Assembly, garnering 201 votes,” it said.

Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) proposed the doubling of taxes on both salaried and non-salaried individuals. It also recommended raising the general sales tax rate to 18% for various essential items such as unprocessed food, stationery, medicines and petroleum products, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that 57 stocks rose while 37 fell in the KSE-100 index with E&P names leading the rally. Oil and Gas Development Company (+7.17%), Pakistan Petroleum (+6.01%) and Mari Petroleum (+2.78%) were the biggest contributors to the gains while banks were the main drag.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal said that the KSE-100 breached the psychological resistance of 66,000 during the trading session but closed at 65,952, gaining 626 points. “Major interest was seen in the E&P sector,” he said.
“Going forward, we expect the uptrend to continue and recommend investors to view any downside as an opportunity to buy stocks in banking, cement and E&P sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 472.9 million shares against Friday’s tally of 344.2 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs16.3 billion.
Shares of 358 companies were traded. Of these, 184 stocks closed higher, 153 dropped and 21 remained unchanged.
Kohinoor Spinning Mills was the volume leader with trading in 67.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.32 to close at Rs5.68. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 60.2 million shares, gaining Rs0.08 to close at Rs1.37 and K-Electric with 36.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.15 to close at Rs5.02.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs675.3 million, according to the NCCPL.

1,Two Sessions fosters stronger Pak-China ties,Experts praise conference for promoting global economic stability,"Pakistani experts have lauded the significance of the “Two Sessions” in fostering global economic stability in the context of jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative, particularly China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiatives.
They believe that the foreign policies and incentives for foreigners in China during these sessions are pivotal in enhancing economic cooperation and promoting sustainable development in the region.
Muhammad Asghar, a correspondent for the Associated Press of Pakistan in China, said that the strategic discussions held during the Two Sessions serve as a platform for fostering stronger ties between Pakistan and China.
“I’m attending different meetings and briefings during the six-day Two Sessions. I will focus on jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative President Xi Jinping launched a decade ago to build a community with a shared future,” he stated.

“I am also looking forward to attending Foreign Minister Wang Yi media interaction and also the opening and closing ceremonies of Two Sessions in the People’s Great Hall,” he added.
Shahid Afraz Khan, a foreign expert in Beijing, said that the strategic discussions and initiatives undertaken during these sessions serve as a testament to the strong partnership between China and the world and their commitment to sustainable economic development.
“Jointly building the BRI has become the biggest mega development project of the 21st century which is successfully negating the spillover repercussions of geopolitics, protectionism, unilateralism, war-theatre mentality, isolation, marginalisation and gearing the developing countries and Global South towards greater socio-economic integration,” Pakistani expert Dr Mehmoodul Hassan Khan told CEN.

2,Police presence bolstered to secure Karachi industries,"Sindh AIGP says initiative aims to curb street crimes, maintain law and order","Sindh Additional Inspector General of Police (AIGP) Karachi Range Khadim Hussain Rind has announced the deployment of an additional 20 police personnel to the SITE Crime Monitoring Cell (SCMC), located within the premises of the SITE Association of Industry (SAI). This initiative aims to curb the increasing incidence of street crimes and maintain law and order in the area.
Rind made this announcement during his visit to the SAI, where he engaged with industrialists to discuss concerns regarding street crimes, snatching, and armed robbery. Industrialists welcomed the reinforcement of 20 police personnel to augment the existing workforce at the base.
Additionally, the AIGP mentioned ongoing anti-narcotics operations targeting suppliers of Gutka, mainpuri, and other illicit substances, resulting in the seizure of chewable items worth billions of rupees. He also highlighted a pending proposal to the Sindh government for the purchase of police vehicles, which, despite six months having passed, is yet to be approved.

Earlier, SAI President Muhammad Kamran Arbi commended the decision to bolster personnel and informed about the induction of 11 more bikes to enhance policing efficiency. Arbi also recognised the commendable efforts of the police team from SITE-A PS in apprehending the culprits involved in a Rs2.5 million dacoit in the SITE area. He announced appreciation certificates and cash rewards for the team members. Additionally, the AIGP also announced one month’s salary for the police personnel involved in the successful recovery of Rs2.5 million in cash.
SAI, Patron-in-Chief, Zubair Motiwala, raised industry-related concerns and highlighted the importance of proper training for police to proactively prevent crimes. He advocated for an increase in the pay scale of police personnel to enable them to lead respectable and honest lives. Motiwala proposed a meeting between traffic police officials and the SAI to address and resolve traffic-related issues.
Industrialist Jawed Bilwani urged for necessary traffic management arrangements at the entry/exit points of the SITE area during the holy month of Ramazan. He also highlighted the issue of non-functional traffic signals, to which AIGP Rind assured that it would be addressed promptly.

3,Apple hit with $2b EU antitrust fine,"Company shares fall by 3% as decision is appealed, Spotify cheers EU ruling","Brussels, on Monday, fined Apple 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) on Monday, for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store, the iPhone maker’s first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.
A basic penalty of 40 million euros was inflated by a huge lump sum included as a deterrent – a first for the European Union’s antitrust authorities.
The European Commission charged Apple last year with preventing Swedish streaming service Spotify and others from informing users of payment options outside its App Store, following a 2019 complaint by Spotify.
It said Apple’s restrictions constituted unfair trading conditions, a relatively novel argument in an antitrust case and also used by the Dutch antitrust agency in a decision against Apple in 2021 in a case brought by dating app providers. It ordered it to stop such conduct.
Apple said it would appeal the decision. A ruling at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, is likely to take several years. Until then, Apple will have to pay the fine and comply with the EU order.
Its shares were last down 3%.
The fine was nearly four times the 500 million euros sources with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters they expected the European Commission to impose on Apple.
It comprised a basic element of 40 million euros – described by European Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager as a “parking ticket” for the US tech giant – plus 1.8 billion euros slapped on top as a deterrent. The 1.84 billion euros total is equal to 0.5% of Apple’s global turnover, she said.
Apple criticised the decision, saying in a statement it was “reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast.”
“The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” it said.

Left in the dark
“Millions of European music streaming users were left in the dark about all available options,” Vestager told a press conference.
“And Apple’s anti-steering rules also made consumers pay more for such services because of the high commission fee imposed on developers and passed on to consumers.”
Spotify cheered the EU decision but said there were other issues in other areas.
“And while we are pleased that this case delivers some justice, it does not solve Apple’s bad behaviour towards developers beyond music streaming in other markets around the world,” the company said in a statement.
Although the fine is big, Apple can handle it without any immediate cash impact, said analyst Ryan Reith at tech and services company IDC.
But he added, “I believe this is another step in the on-going process of breaking down some of the walled gardens that Apple has created around its ecosystem.” In the past decade, the EU regulator has fined Alphabet’s Google a total 8.25 billion euro over three cases.
Vestager’s order to Apple to remove its App Store restrictions echoes the same requirement under new EU tech rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which Apple has to be in compliance with on March 7.
In contrast to the music streaming case, Apple is seeking to settle another EU antitrust investigation by offering to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment systems to rivals.
EU regulators, who subsequently sought feedback from rivals and users, will likely accept its offer without fining the company.

4,Oil steadies after OPEC+ cut extension,Russia’s decision to cut oil output and exports surprises analysts,"Oil prices were little changed on Monday, a day after the widely expected extension of voluntary output cuts through the middle of the year by the OPEC+ producer group.
Brent futures were up19 cents to $83.74 a barrelat 1422 GMT after rising 2.4% last week. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 6 cents to $80.03 a barrel following a 4.6% gain last week.
The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) are extending their voluntary oil output cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) into the second quarter to cushion the market amid global economic concerns and rising output outside the group.

Read Oil gains on potential OPEC+ cuts
As market expectations for a rollover had grown more apparent recently, the extension may have been increasingly priced in, said Walt Chancellor, an energy strategist at Macquarie.
“With OPEC loadings appearing steady and aggregate OPEC supply potentially showing little effect from incremental voluntary cuts implemented in Q1, we do not view the extensions from the broader group as particularly impactful.”
Still, Russia’s announcement to cut its oil output and exports by an additional 471,000 bpd in the second quarter surprised some analysts.

5,FBR dismisses proposal for 18% sales tax on cars,Believes lower tax on vehicles will result in revenue loss,"The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has turned down a proposal of the Ministry of Industries that sought to impose 18% general sales tax (GST) on locally manufactured cars across the board, saying it will result in a fall in tax collection as well as revenue loss.
The Industries and Production Division was requested to provide its input on the rationalisation of criterion for the imposition of 25% sales tax on locally manufactured and assembled vehicles while avoiding the undermining of tax base by ensuring that no car variant and model became liable to a lower tax rate than what was currently applicable.
In response, the Industries and Production Division, in a recent meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), proposed that 18% sales tax should be applicable to all local auto manufacturers and assemblers without any discrimination. It, however, recommended that sales tax should not be increased on cars below 1,400cc engine capacity.
However, the FBR did not concur with the recommendation, believing it would allow sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and other vehicles, currently paying 25% sales tax, to pay only 18% tax. It would lead to the shrinking of the tax base as well as revenue loss, it cautioned.
Therefore, “given the commitment under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement, it would not be possible to agree with the proposal,” the FBR said.
It told the meeting that, considering the unprecedented fiscal and current account challenges and the immediate need to pour resources for stabilisation of the economy, the sales tax on luxury goods, previously chargeable at the standard rate (17%), was enhanced to 25% ad valorem in March 2023.
The enhanced sales tax was also applicable to the locally manufactured and assembled double-cabin vehicles.
It was imposed on locally manufactured and assembled vehicles with engine capacity of 1,400cc and above, and locally manufactured/ assembled SUVs/CUVs as a class, irrespective of the engine capacity.

Read PAAPAM decries proposed sales tax hike
The FBR pointed out that the 25% sales tax on SUVs/CUVs, as a class of goods, created market imbalance for vehicles below 1,400cc engine capacity, making them uncompetitive with sedan cars of similar capacity. It stressed that SUVs/CUVs should be provided a level playing field and to address the anomaly, a summary was sent to the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Changes (CCLC) on August 3, 2023, proposing that all locally manufactured vehicles with price exceeding Rs5 million (excluding sales tax), irrespective of the engine capacity or cabin, be made liable to pay 25% sales tax.
Another summary was sent on December 20, 2023, incorporating the views of the Industries and Production Division and proposing 25% GST on all locally manufactured vehicles with invoice price exceeding Rs35 million (excluding sales tax).
It was pointed out that the proposed price benchmark was reduced from Rs5 million as some of the vehicles, currently liable to pay 25% sales tax, had a price less than Rs5 million.
The CCLC considered the matter and its decision was ratified by the federal cabinet. The CCLC did not agree with the FBR’s proposal and directed it to submit the matter to the cabinet after making a thorough internal assessment.
Accordingly, the matter was reconsidered and it was proposed that the condition of 1,400cc engine capacity may be retained to safeguard the tax base.
However, to provide a level playing field to all luxury vehicles, it was proposed that a price benchmark of Rs4 million (excluding sales tax) may be applied as an additional criterion for levying sales tax at the enhanced rate of 25%.
Resultantly, vehicles below 1,400cc and having price less than Rs4 million would attract the standard tax rate of 18%. It was pointed out that all locally manufactured and assembled vehicles below 850cc would remain liable to pay the reduced tax rate of 12.5%.
Similarly, hybrid electric vehicles would enjoy reduced tax rates provided under the Eighth Schedule of the Sales Tax Act 1990. The estimated annual revenue impact of the proposal would be Rs4.5 billion.

8,Rupee depreciates for 2nd day in a row,Currency comes under pressure despite higher dollar supply,"Pakistani currency maintained its downtick for the second consecutive working day on Monday, standing at Rs279.26 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee inched down 0.02%, or Rs0.07, against the greenback on a day-on-day basis.
Market talk suggests that the rupee came under little bit of pressure despite higher supply of the foreign currency in the banking system.
Rising petroleum prices in the international market and the strengthening US dollar against other major global currencies together mounted pressure on the rupee. Crude oil price has risen to $79 per barrel and may soon reach $80. With this increase, Pakistan’s energy import bill is likely to swell, resulting in higher demand for dollars to make import payments.

Read Rupee falls slightly from 4-month high
On the other hand, the US dollar has strengthened around 3% in the past couple of months.
The rupee has been fluctuating in a narrow band of Rs279-280/$ for over
five weeks. 
In the open market, the currency dropped Rs0.02 to Rs282.05/$, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.
The disparity between the inter-bank and retail markets widened to Rs2.79 (almost 1%), about a quarter percentage point away from the International Monetary Fund recommended maximum limit of 1.25%.

9,SBP achieves 60% financial inclusion,Aims to lead National Financial Literacy Programme for adults and youngsters,"Pakistan has significantly expanded the reach of banking services to encompass 60% of the adult population, including 43% female citizens. This achievement comes alongside the introduction and induction of innovative digital banking, underlining the belief that financial inclusion is a fundamental right that aids in alleviating poverty and fostering equitable economic growth.
The access to banking services has more than doubled compared to the recent past when it stood at 25-30% of the adult population. The Covid-19 pandemic played a pivotal role in accelerating the adoption of digital services in the country.
Speaking during an online address at the inaugural event of Pakistan Financial Literacy Week (PFLW) from March 4 to 8, themed ‘Digital Bankari – fori aur asaan (Digital Banking – Instant and Easy)’, organised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) at its headquarters on Monday, Governor Jameel Ahmad said, “When more people have access to financial services, it creates a broad base of consumers, savers, and entrepreneurs, stimulating economic growth. Financial inclusion is a cornerstone of a thriving and equitable economy.”
“By providing individuals with the necessary knowledge and skills to manage their finances wisely, we empower them to break the cycle of poverty, plan for the future, and seize opportunities for economic development. Financial literacy enables people to make informed decisions about savings, borrowing, investing, entrepreneurship, and protecting themselves from financial risks.”
Ahmad highlighted the advancements in financial inclusion in Pakistan, attributing them to the initiation of the online banking journey, digital onboarding of customers, and the accessibility of banking services to unbanked and underbanked individuals through various digital platforms and technology. As of June 2023, there were approximately 177 million bank accounts in Pakistan. “Of these, 83 million are unique accounts, which constitute 60% of the 137 million adult population.”
It is noteworthy that women own a total of 49 million accounts, with 29 million being unique accounts, representing more than 43% of the female adult population.
The central bank is taking targeted steps to devise policies aimed at better integrating the female population into the formal financial system. The SBP governor underscored that, “Sustained economic growth is not possible if half of the population (women) is systematically excluded from the workforce.”

To address historical gaps in the financial services industry, SBP has introduced the Banking on Equality Policy, complementing its National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) and other initiatives to provide better access to financial services for women.
Additionally, SBP is spearheading various initiatives in partnership with banks to provide equitable and easy access to a range of financial services, including RAAST, the instant national payment gateway, ASAAN Digital Account, ASAAN Mobile Account, and more recently, digital banks.
Finally, the SBP has introduced specialised schemes to enhance access to finance, such as the SME Asaan Finance or SAAF Scheme, the Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs, the Line of Credit for MSMEs, and the Prime Minister’s Youth Business and Agriculture Loan Scheme. These initiatives have significantly advanced financial inclusion in Pakistan, bringing the total number of bank accounts to 60% of the 137 million adult population, according to SBP Governor Ahmad.
In this era of digitalisation, banks should leverage digital platforms to empower individuals with essential financial knowledge. Ahmad envisions a future where every citizen has access to banking services through smartphones, facilitating transactions, savings, and investments with ease.
In its strategic plan for the next five years, ‘SBP Vision 2028,’ SBP aims to strengthen the financial inclusion framework through targeted policy initiatives with an enhanced focus on digital means.
Ahmad stressed that financial literacy is the nation’s collective responsibility. Collaborating with the banking industry and academia, SBP is leading two iterations of the National Financial Literacy Programme (NFLP), one for adults and one for youngsters.
“These initiatives are instrumental in disseminating financial literacy to more than 2.9 million individuals, with over 50% female participation. Additionally, we witnessed an impressive 80% account opening rate among beneficiaries under NFLP,” he said.
