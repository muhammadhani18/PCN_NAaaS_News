0,PTV continues blackout of opposition lawmakers in NA coverage,SIC legislators to file privilege motion against state-owned electronic media.,"ISLAMABAD: The state-owned electronic media on Monday continued blocking speeches made by members of National Assembly (MNAs) belonging to the opposition. However, the authorities concerned expressed ignorance about the decision to black out the opposition.
Leaders of PTI, who are sitting under the banner of Sunni Itehad Council (SIC) in the lower house of parliament, have announced to submit a privilege motion against Pakistan Television (PTV).
Speaking in the National Assembly on Monday morning before Shehbaz Sharif took oath as the prime minister, Omer Ayub conveyed his concerns to the speaker and said the state media was discriminating against them.
 


“My speech was not aired by PTV while I was making a speech yesterday (Sunday) as a candidate for the slot of prime minister,” Mr Ayub said, adding: “This was despite the fact that not a single word from my speech was expunged by the speaker. The question is why Shehbaz Sharif’s speech was aired directly.” He also announced to submit a privilege motion against the PTV.

SIC legislators to file privilege motion against state-owned electronic media

Incidentally, after his speech, there was a total blackout of Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Akhtar Mengal whereas there were repeated blockades and interruptions by PTV when Asad Qaiser was given the floor. Their speeches were not only censured on the PTV telecast but also PTV’s channel on social media.
The privilege motion against PTV will be referred to the NA committee on rules and privileges after it will be formed.
Later in his speech, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari referred to the complaint of Omar Ayub that the opposition members’ speeches were not being broadcast on the state-run TV.
 


He said: “We should not continue this tradition [of censorship] set by Khan sahib. We have to make decisions that strengthen this house and brighten the country’s future.”
He said our colleagues would have been able to listen to the prime minister’s speech if they had not been protesting.
On the other hand, no authority acknowledged responsibility for the blackout of coverage.
Murtaza Solangi was the caretaker minister for information and broadcasting till the oath-taking of Mr Sharif as prime minister on Monday afternoon.
When he was asked about the reasons for the blackout of the speeches by the MNAs belonging to the opposition, Mr Solangi said the PTV managing director was the responsible person to answer the query. However, there was no reply either from the secretary information or the PTV chief.

2,SC wants cutting of paper mulberry trees in presence of CDA staff,Also orders that except for the paper mulberry no other species should be chopped off in the park.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday amended its earlier order of allowing the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to remove from inside F-9 (Fatima Jinnah) Park only paper mulberry trees - a plant species which triggers allergies every spring. The court said the allergen plant should be cut only in the presence of CDA staff.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a three-judge bench also ordered that except for the paper mulberry no other species should be chopped off in the park. The court sought names of experts from the parties involved in the case.
The Supreme Court had taken up a notice under Article 184(3) of the Constitution on a suo motu after its registrar put up a note before the three-judge committee constituted under section 2 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 to consider whether proceedings may be commenced under Article 184(3) since reportedly a larger number of trees had been cut and there was a systematic deforestation taking place in Fatima F-9 Park.
Besides, citizens were complaining that the trees were being cut on the directions of CDA and that the Supreme Court should intervene to prevent the valuable resource of the citizens from being destroyed.
At the last hearing on Tuesday, the court had appointed joint commissioners, consisting of President Mian Aqeel Afzal and General Secretary Press Association of Supreme Court (PAS) Imran Waseem, under Order XXXII of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 to visit the park and take photographs/record videos showing the area where trees had been cut and area deforested.
Subsequently, the commissioners furnished a report, stating that the CDA was claiming plantation of more than the double number of trees which had been cut off and according to the authority some 7,000 trees had been removed from 52 acres inside the park though 15,000 planted.
“It is a fact that most of area has been covered by planning saplings of different plant species in the recent days,” the commissioners’ report said though it also recommended that the number of plants should be increased in the area, adding a CDA dump office inside the park should be removed since it posed an environment hazard.
It suggested to the apex court to consider adding more members to the commission for enhancing its monitoring performance. It also stated that a stream inside the park had been contaminated due to sewage and dumping. The commissioners suggested strict monitoring by the CDA to clean the stream that will enhance the beauty of the park.
Moreover, the report suggested ordering shifting of a private flying club covering a vast area inside the park. The report said when the commissioners visited the park CDA officials briefed them about cutting of only paper mulberry trees since it was responsible for health issues like trigging pollen allergy.
The officials said the total area of green cover was around 108 acres and until Feb 27 the authority had removed trees from 52 acres.
“We have no reason to doubt their statement regarding the area. It is quite obvious that there are different types of trees in the forest area inside the park. It is a fact that majority of the trees inside the park were paper mulberry,” said the report.

3,IIUI finally succeeds in getting president’s nod to BoT’s decisions,University delayed issuance of minutes of BoT meeting held on December 11 for over two months,"ISLAMABAD: Outgoing President Dr Arif Alvi signed the much-delayed minutes of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), paving the way for implementation of several major decisions.
The president, being head of the BoT, after approving the draft minutes on February 28 directed the IIUI rector to circulate them amongst the members. The ministry of education shared the draft minutes with President Alvi on Feb 27 and the very next day he signed it.
Some of the major decisions remained pending because of non-issuance of the minutes of the meeting held on December 11 by the university in a highly questionable move.
Sources said now the IIUI will have to implement the decisions made by BOT at its meeting.

University delayed issuance of minutes of BoT meeting held on December 11 for over two months

The sources said three BoT nominees for the Board of Governors (BoG) approved by the chancellor and notified by Ministry of Education will now have to officially be accepted by the university. The minutes said BoT had decided that a committee headed by Dr Qibla Ayaz, chairman Council of Islamic Ideology, will inquire into the administrative and financial issues of IIUI. If the university did not take corrective measures in one month, the committee was likely to start its work.
Meanwhile, sources said the BOT had approved allocation of four seats to elected representatives of the teachers in the BoT (one each to lecturers, assistant professors, associate professors and professors), but the administration has not yet accepted the decision.
Last month, HEC Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed and Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa through separate letters had pointed out bad governance at the IIUI and demanded meetings of the university’s BoT and BoG.
In a letter addressed to Rector Prof Dr Samina Malik, the HEC chairman had asked her to “furnish report/comments by February 29 on the issue listed above and to forthwith call a meeting of BoG, failing which HEC would be compelled to formally call for a review of your performance as the IIUI rector.”
Dr Ahmed stated that the university over the past few months had been grappling with a governance crisis.
“The crisis has wide-ranging manifestations, from financial and administrative issues to violation of statutory provisions with regard to meetings and subsequent implementation of the decisions taken therein, of the statutory bodies of the university,” read the letter.
The HEC chairman pointed out that the minutes of the 15th meeting of BoT, which was held on December 11, 2023, have not been finalised despite a lapse of two months.
“As reported, the considerable influence of a junior officer and his undue involvement in the university’s affairs has resulted in highly controversial decisions shrouded in favouritism and cemented mistrust among the university’s leadership, faculty and its administration.”
The chairman HEC also pointed out harassment on the campus. “Few female faculty members have also complained of facing harassment at the workplace which you [rector] had also confirmed in the BoT meeting - with the gravity of the grievance being so severe that FIRs have been lodged against a few junior as well senior officers of the university - leading to a tarnishing image of the institute.”
Moreover, he said that circulation of such news had also adversely reflected upon the admissions in the spring session.
Meanwhile, another member of the BOT, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, also wrote a letter to President Arif Alvi, complaining that minutes of the BoT meeting held in December last year were still awaited despite a lapse of 72 days.
“The systematic destruction of the university was noted in the said meeting of BoT. However, rather than redressing the concerns…and implementing the decisions that were taken, they are being thwarted by the paid employees of the university,” read the CJP’s letter.
Sources said that after the two letters, the draft minutes were forwarded to President Alvi, who approved them.
A spokesperson for IIUI, Nasir Farid, said minutes were finalized on time. Asked about the two letters, he said commenting on letter of CJP was not appropriate for him; however, “we have responded to letter of the chairman HEC in detail.”
He said the university had contested the HEC’s letter regarding governance issue. “There is no governance issue at IIUI rather some people are trying to tarnish the image of this prestigious university,” he said.

4,Minister raises concerns over increase in obesity-related diseases,"ISLAMABAD: On Monday, World Obesity Day was observed, and former health minister Dr. Nadeem Jan said that obesity ...","ISLAMABAD: On Monday, World Obesity Day was observed, and former health minister Dr. Nadeem Jan said that obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were alarmingly increasing in Pakistan.
“More than 40 percent of people in Pakistan are obese or overweight. The prevalence of overweight among children under 5 has almost doubled from 2011 to 2018. The obesity and weight have increased in women of reproductive age from 28pc to 38pc in five years. Sugary drinks / ultra-processed products often high in sugar, salt, or trans-fats are among the major contributors to obesity and many other non-communicable diseases,” he said while speaking to participants of an event organised by the Pakistan National Heart Association (PANAH) at a local hotel in Islamabad.
The guests included former President PANAH, Gen. (R) General Ashraf Khan, Country Representative of Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI) Munawar Hussain, Vice President PANAH Col. Dr. Shakeel Ahmed Mirza, President National Press Club Islamabad Mr. Anwar Raza, CEO Heartfile Dr. Saba Amjad, health professionals, civil society representatives, and media.
Dr. Jan reiterated the government’s dedication to tackling the obesity epidemic and NCDs. He said that the Ministry of National Health Services was committed to taking all possible measures to improve public health in Pakistan.
“Ministry of health has recently banned the use of Sugary drinks in health ministry and issued an advisory to other ministries to ban these unhealthy drinks in their respective domains,” he said.
Gen ® Ashraf Khan delivered a keynote address shedding light on modifiable risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases and obesity. He said that overweight and obesity were the key modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular and many other fatal non-communicable diseases.
“High body mass index (BMI) contributes considerably to NCDs. Unhealthy diets are among the major contributors to obesity. Government should take immediate policy measures to reduce the risk of obesity in Pakistan. There is need for higher taxes on ultra-processed foods to reduce their consumption,” he said.
Munawar Hussain, in his presentation, delved into policies aimed at reducing the consumption of ultra-processed products, with a special focus on higher taxes on sugary drinks, chocolates, ice creams, salty and sweet snacks, fast foods, baked items, ready-to-eat meals, and processed meat.
“Taxing ultra-processed foods is a triple win for government as it reduces the obesity and other non-communicable diseases, generate additional revenue for the government, and government does not bear any cost. The revenue collected from taxes must be earmarked fully or partially for public health programs,” he said.
“Sugary drinks are the largest source of the intake of the sugar in the diet. The liquid sugar alters the metabolism of the body, promote excess calorie intake which can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes” said by Dr. Shakeel Ahmed Mirza.

5,"Over 400,000 saplings to be planted in spring","TAXILA: A total of over 400,000 saplings would be planted across the Attock district during the ongoing spring tree...","TAXILA: A total of over 400,000 saplings would be planted across the Attock district during the ongoing spring tree plantation drive.
This was stated by Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the spring tree plantation campaign at Kalla Chitta forest range near Attock on Tuesday.
Mr Raza said that under the campaign, saplings were being planted in government forests, on the land of several government departments, including the defence in particular, and on private lands across the district.
He added that the campaign had kicked off in the district and that maximum efforts were being made to make the campaign a success.
Unveiling details of the campaign, the deputy commissioner noted that 50,000 saplings would be planted in various government forests, especially those located in Attock, Fatehjang, and Jand Tehsil.
Furthermore, 11,000 saplings would be planted by various provincial government departments, including education, agriculture, and environment, while 190,000 would be distributed to various defence organisations located in the district, especially the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and artillery centre, Mr Raza said, adding that so far, 33,300 saplings have been issued to defence organisations for plantation.
Mr Raza mentioned that over 150,000 saplings would be distributed among NGOs and the general public during the spring plantation drive.
Greenery and forestation were essential to controlling environmental pollution, a menace that led the world towards global warming, Mr Raza noted.
“A minimum forest covering 25 percent of the area is necessary to keep the natural environment clean,” Mr Raza said.
He added that as the olive plant was a drought-tolerant staple plant, efforts would be taken to increase olive farming in the Barani areas of the district, especially Jand, Basal, and Pindigheab.
“Saplings of different species like Chir, Pine, Robinia, Poplar, and others were being planted under the campaign in various parts of the district, especially Hassanabdal, Hazro, and Attock City,” he added.
The deputy commissioner further directed the Tehsil Forest Officers (TFOs) and other officials concerned to plant maximum saplings with the help and cooperation of civil society, officials, and students during the campaign, urging that students of various schools and colleges should also be involved in the spring plantation campaign.
“We should plant as many trees as possible because life would be impossible without them,” he said, adding that many species of animals depend on trees as their natural habitat, as they provide shelter, food, and protection for them.

6,"Pakistan faces a ‘polycrisis’, says Maleeha",ISLAMABAD: Amb. Dr Maleeha Lodhi stated on Monday that Pakistan is faced with the stark choice to persist in a state...,"ISLAMABAD: Amb. Dr Maleeha Lodhi stated on Monday that Pakistan is faced with the stark choice to persist in a state of governance failure and societal challenges or to transform through reforms that prioritize governance improvement and public welfare over elite interests.
“This choice will determine the fate and fortunes of the country,” Dr. Lodhi said at the launch of the book she edited, “Pakistan - Search for Stability.”
The book launch at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI), a government-funded think tank.
“Pakistan is at an inflection point, locked in a state of instability, with its promising potential remaining unrealized,” she said.
Dr Lodhi, who has served as Pakistan’s envoy at the UN and in UK and US, recalled that since she edited her initial publication ‘Pakistan: Beyond the Crisis State’ over two decades ago, which held optimism for Pakistan’s potential to overcome its crises, the country finds itself deeper in turmoil.
Now, in its 76th year of independence, she maintained, Pakistan faces a ‘polycrisis’—an entanglement of governance, economic, political, security, and demographic crises that have intensified and converged, compounding the country’s challenges far beyond the scope of any single issue identified earlier. This progression, she said, suggests an urgent need for more comprehensive and multifaceted solutions to navigate an increasingly complex crisis landscape.
Explaining the reasons behind Pakistan’s elusive search for stability, she said, “Pakistan’s search for stability has been frustrated by lack of governance, rule without law, political disruptions, visionless leadership and of course the headwinds from a volatile neighborhood that has posed enduring security dilemmas.”
She argued that Pakistan may have in the past navigated through numerous challenges and crises through its inherent resilience, but the systemic issues of today are distinctively different and cannot be deferred any longer.
Moreover, they must be addressed collectively rather than individually if Pakistan aims to progress towards a future marked by economic development, advancement, and prosperity, she maintained.
Director General ISSI Amb. Sohail Mahmood, in his remarks on this occasion, said, “The book’s prescription, keeping in view Pakistan’s particular context and also drawing upon the experience of other countries, is clear and unambiguous: Visionary leadership supported by a competent team committed to reform and transformative change.”
The Book: This volume comprises essays contributed by well know professionals, all unified in their belief that Pakistan has the potential to alter its trajectory, solve its problems, and surmount its challenges, setting it on a path toward recovery and rejuvenation. On the basis of their expertise, they propose ideas and policy strategies aimed at fostering governance that is attuned to the needs of the people.
It showcases a range of viewpoints and perspectives, yet all authors share the conviction that meaningful change necessitates bold reforms, which they outline in their contributions. Furthermore, they concur that the people of Pakistan must take an active role in redefining and rescuing their country from its current predicament.
The topics addressed in this book span the wide spectrum of challenges facing Pakistan and the critical opportunities awaiting action.
It delves into governance, civil-military dynamics, economic rejuvenation, internal and external security issues, demographic shifts, human development, climate change, religious extremism, international relations, and women’s roles, offering insights on addressing these concerns.
A recurring theme throughout the text is the emergence of a robust state that serves its citizens rather than a select few, achievable only through a comprehensive reform agenda that confronts Pakistan’s deep-seated and structural challenges, ensuring its long-term stability.
