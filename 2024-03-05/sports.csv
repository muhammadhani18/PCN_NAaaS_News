7,Three going to buy cheap pickup truck abducted in Kashmore,Kidnappers demand Rs15 million in ransom from relatives,"In a gripping tale of crime and deception, three individuals, including the skilled mechanic Nazir Kashmiri, his apprentice Aslam Shah, and their relative Anwer Kashmiri, were abducted in Kashmore district under ominous circumstances.
The saga began when Nazir Kashmiri, seeking to purchase a bargain pickup truck advertised on a social media platform, ventured to Kashmore along with his companions. Little did they know that this journey would plunge them into the hands of ruthless criminals lurking amidst the riverine forests along the Indus River.
Trusting the seller's invitation, the trio embarked on what seemed like a routine transaction, only to find themselves ensnared in a nefarious trap. Cut off from communication, their loved ones embarked on a frantic search, only to be met with silence.
However, hope flickered dimly as the abductors made contact with the distraught families, demanding a hefty ransom of Rs15 million for their safe return. 
Threats of violence echoed through the phone lines, sending shivers down the spines of the desperate relatives. 
The kidnapers made the relatives listen to screams of their loved ones as they were brutally beaten, pleading to make the payment to rescue them.
In a chilling twist, one family member revealed the grave consequences awaiting if the media were to intervene, painting a harrowing picture of potential harm or worse, should their plight be publicized.
Yet, amidst the shadows of fear and uncertainty, a beacon of solidarity emerged as the community rallied behind the beleaguered families, pooling resources to secure the safe release of their loved ones.
As authorities grapple with the unfolding crisis, the boundaries blur between jurisdictions, with the Tando Adam police urging the families of the abductees to coordinate with Kashmore police to file the case.
