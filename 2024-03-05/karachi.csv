4,SHC annoyed over closure of Sir Shah Suleman Road during PSL matches for security,"Contempt application filed against police, local administration officials for defying earlier court order.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday warned police and the district administration of legal consequences on a plea seeking contempt proceedings against the authorities for blocking Sir Shah Suleman Road near the National Stadium during the Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches in defiance of an earlier court order.
Led by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, a two-judge bench directed the officials to come up with comments on Tuesday (today) after they requested for time to file a joint statement.
When the bench took up for hearing an application filed by a petitioner seeking contempt proceedings against the officials for violating a recent order of the SHC, the DIG-traffic was found absent and a reply filed on his behalf stated that he had communicated the court order to the officials concerned for the compliance.
 
 

Expressing resentment over his absence and closure of Sir Shah Suleman Road despite an undertaking filed by police, the chief justice directed the DIG and other officials to appear in court immediately.

Contempt application filed against police, local administration officials for defying earlier court order

Thereafter, DIG Iqbal Dara, along with some officials, appeared in court and submitted that the traffic police had not closed the road in question.  The DIG-operations informed the court that the road was blocked due to security reasons.
The chief justice remarked that the entire city had been put at stake on the pretext of security concerns and advised the officials that the traffic on roads adjacent to the stadium might be stopped only when the teams arrived or left the ground.
He asked the officials present in court to file written statement/undertaking that no road would be closed without any cogent reason.
The chief justice said that he was very disappointed with the replies of the officials concerned despite the fact that the court had passed a very clear order on the subject matter.
He also stated that fortunately people still had faith in judiciary and warned that the public might take to streets if they could not get justice from courts.
He directed the officials to ensure that the subject road must not be blocked.
A provincial law officer, along with other officials present in the courtroom, requested the bench to grant time to file a joint statement on the behalf of the officials concerned.
The owner of a supermarket had petitioned the SHC on Feb 20, submitting that the store was located on Sir Shah Suleman Road and during the PSL as well as international cricket matches at the stadium, the authorities used to block the thoroughfare in question along with adjacent service roads in the past and set to do so during the ongoing PSL.
On Feb 27, the bench disposed of the petition after a statement filed on behalf of the DIG-traffic assured it that the road in question would not be blocked during the matches of 9th edition of the PSL to be held in the city.
The DIG-traffic had submitted that a meeting about the PSL was held under the chairmanship of Sindh police chief at Central Police Office wherein it was decided that Sir Shah Suleman Road would not be closed during the PSL matches in the provincial metropolis.
However, the petitioners filed an application seeking contempt proceedings against the DIG and DC for not complying with the Feb 29 order of the SHC and stated that on March 3, the alleged contemnors blocked the road in question as well as streets and lanes leading to the main road for three to four hours before the start of the match and blockades were not removed even after the match ended.

5,"Veteran classical artist entertains, enlightens music lovers","Ustad Raza Ali Khan says someone having passion for music, but without a good voice, can sing well after rigorous riyaz","KARACHI: A conversation with Ustad Raza Ali Khan, the grandson of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, at the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) on Monday evening entertained and enlightened music lovers on some finer points of classical music.
The event was moderated by Sharif Awan whose Tehzeeb Foundation co-hosted it.
After a rather effusive introduction to classical music with reference to dhrupad and khayal, Mr Awan asked Ustad Raza Ali Khan, who also performed at the recently concluded 21st edition of the All Pakistan Music Conference (APMC), about his opinion on the subject. 
The Ustad said Hazrat Amir Khusrau initiated the idea of the khayal but it was the later musicians who established it firmly. In that context, he told the audience about how the ragas were formed and how they were fine-tuned by introducing segments such as bandishein and bahlavey.

Ustad Raza Ali Khan says someone having passion for music, but without a good voice, can sing well after rigorous riyaz

The chitchat was interspersed with live music. Ustad Raza Ali Khan in order to demonstrate what he had told in response to the first question performed raga jhannjoti (the raga in which the famous ghazal Gulaon mein rang bharey is composed) and during the performance educated the audience, which hadn’t turned up in a big number, on how a raga is embellished.
The second question that Mr Awan put to him, after highlighting the interconnectedness of poetry and music, was to do with: how to have the rass in singing. Explaining it, the Ustad said the essential element of the rass is produced to moisten (tar) the voice and not let it dry (khuhsk). The ultimate aim is to achieve roundness (golai) or beauty of the voice that touches the heart. He demonstrated that bit as well.
The next query was related to the formation of new bandashein. The Ustad said his grandfather did come up with his own bandishein such Prem Jogan that he sang for the iconic film Mughal-i-Azam. Naturally, he was then asked to sing it, which he did.
After that the floor was opened for the audience to ask questions. 
One of them asked about what if someone who doesn’t have a good singing voice sees the light of day in a musical family. The Ustad answered that with rigorous riyaz and passion for the music someone who ostensibly doesn’t have a good voice can sing well.
The audience then requested the Ustad to sing raga hameer. He did a nice job with hameer. He sang a tappa in raga bhairvi as well.

8,A glimpse into an architect’s heart,KARACHI: Listening to architect Mukhtar Husain in conversation with fellow architect Khadija Jamal to introduce his...,"


 
KARACHI: Listening to architect Mukhtar Husain in conversation with fellow architect Khadija Jamal to introduce his book of memoirs, titled Foundations and Form, at the Karachi Club Annexe on Monday felt like the author greeting you from a window of his house and then opening a door to invite you inside to meet up close the architect, teacher, writer, critic and family man.
Written originally for his grandchildren, all of whom reside abroad and have gone through different cultures and experiences while their own country Pakistan has been left out, he wanted to tell them about this land, which is his base, by writing about his life and experiences here.
While talking about his career as an architect, he said that he had decided at the age of 10 that he was going to become an architect. “But then after completing school, I realised that there was no architectural college in Karachi. That was when one of my teachers in Grammar School suggested I study architecture in Turkiye,” he said.
He was 17 when he proceeded to Turkiye to be exposed to that part of the world. Today, he calls it his second home. Graduating in December 1971, almost at the same time as the fall of Dhaka, he was asked by his father to not return home as things were not looking up here. “He asked me to study further in order to stay back in Turkiye so I thought I would do a Master’s in industrial design,” he added.
The course was supposed to take him two years to complete but circumstances were such that he finished the course in six months to keep pace with a teacher who was going away. As things had still not improved in the job market by June 1972 in Pakistan, Mukhtar was again asked by his father to not return. So this time he went to Europe, to Munich and then Frankfurt where he settled down as a worker in a food factory.
Making a bit of money after working there for three months, he returned to Turkiye in February 1973 but soon his parents asked him to return to Pakistan where he started working with a private sector construction company. In 1997, he also decided to open his own firm after working with other companies. He also worked on the airport project in Karachi.
“Karachi has always been my anchor. I was born here, I studied here but Karachi has changed as it grew from a city of a million to a city of 25 million people. Still, I belong here. I have traveled to more than 40 countries but I always yearn to return here,” he said.
Throughout the book, as observed by the moderator, there are two main persons, who have had a huge influence in his life; his father Inayat Husain and his better half Rumana Malik Husain. “There are few people who know me, who also knew my father but everyone who knows me, knows Rumana because she takes interest in my work and is always by my side,” he said.
About his father, he said that he looked up to him. “I used to constantly correspond with him from Turkiye, Germany, Switzerland, etc. I had his guidance throughout. Then when I returned to Pakistan, he gave me all the letters I had written to him. When I re-read them, I found so much data. Also, I have been writing travel diaries myself. So when writing my memoirs, I had so much data and records thanks to both of these sources,” he said.
On the occasion, Mukhtar’s life partner, Rumana Husain disclosed that her rukhsati was exactly 47 years ago. She said had she written a book about Mukhtar, it would focus on her 47 years with him. “He is the most caring and loving husband,” she said, adding that he is also a very honest man. “I have also seen him turn down projects. We may not be rolling in money but our conscience is clear,” she said.
Adil Husain, the couple’s son, also spoke on the occasion. He said that he left home to go abroad some 27 years ago. “There have been moments in my life when I have needed his advice and regardless of the distance between us, he has always been there for me.”
Jamal Sangu, the Consul General of Turkiye, the chief guest on the occasion, also spoke about some great architectural designs in the world that are all the creation of great human architects.

The team of international auditors, led by Oscar Annabel Rubio, had arrived at Karachi on Feb 18 to conduct its 10-day full-scale audit. The audit, which aimed at enhancing the standards of aviation security through a process of regular evaluation and oversight mechanism, was completed on Feb 27.
In a briefing held at the CAA headquarters, the visiting team provided an overview of the full-scale audit and congratulated the authority’s director general on the significant improvements made, particularly following the recent enactment of the CAA Act 2023. 
“The team was pleased to see that CAA not only surpassed the new 2023 ICAO benchmark effortlessly, but also came close to achieving the ICAO goals set for 2030,” said a CAA press release.
During the assessment, the audit team primarily focused on evaluating the CAA Aviation Security Directorate for five days. Subsequently, for the following four days, they examined the implementation of security protocols in various aviation security areas at Jinnah International Airport, including the airport itself, the Airport Security Force (ASF), domestic and international airlines, cargo companies, ground handling companies, catering companies, etc. 
Additionally, the team visited the Passport Office and received a briefing, and expressed their satisfaction with what they observed. They also interacted with the FIA immigration staff and reviewed their procedures. 
This comprehensive assessment took place after 2019, which was not a full-scale audit. 
The ICAO USAP-CMA Audit Team expressed their deep appreciation for the warm and welcoming hospitality they experienced in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, an ASF press release said that its core responsibilities such as, access control mechanisms, screening processes, perimeter defence strategies, security training initiatives, and adherence to established rules, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and protocol questions (PQs) were some of the main areas assessed.
The chief security officer of the ASF provided an in-depth briefing to the audit team on aviation security measures, and the ASF’s proficiency and preparedness in managing emergency scenarios at the airport. 
“The auditors meticulously examined the adherence to ICAO’s Security and Passenger Facilitation Standards and Recommended Practices, monitored ongoing security operations, inspected access control and passenger screening measures, visited the CCTV surveillance centres, and conducted interviews with the staff.
It said that the audit team commended ASF’s aviation security framework during the concluding ceremony held on Feb 27. 
They affirmed that Pakistan has not merely met but exceeded the newly established ICAO benchmarks for 2023. Furthermore, the security strategies implemented by the ASF were considered as closely aligned with the ICAO’s standards for 2030, heralding a significant accolade for Pakistan, it added.

12,NHA woos foreign firms to build M6 after contract cancelled by caretaker govt,"HYDERABAD: The National High­way Authority (NHA) is said to have engaged different firms, including those based in...","HYDERABAD: The National High­way Authority (NHA) is said to have engaged different firms, including those based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and China, in talks on executing the 306km Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway (M6) project the contract of which was cancelled by the caretaker government last month.
The contract was cancelled when, according to some NHA officials’ claim, the Italian-based firm was unable to achieve financial close -- a term used in contracts for arranging finances for the project to be executed by the firm or consortium of firms concerned.
“Yes, NHA is in the process of talking to UAE- and China-based firms for starting the project afresh now and it is very logical. When I say afresh, it means starting process to finalise financial modalities of project,” an official confided to Dawn. He said that a UAE-based firm had shown some interest in the project. “But it is just preliminary stage that talks are under way with Chinese and UAE firms,” he explained.
Another NHA official pointed out that since a new federal government was being formed, the process of a new contract would be expedited.
“The firm based in the UAE is engaged with NHA through the forum of Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and World Bank has also been separately approached to discuss loan modalities for the project,” said one official, who avoided to speak on the revised cost of the project considering the price escalation factor. He said that WB‘s requirements were to be understood if it came to arranging finances for the project. One official, however, hinted that the overall revised cost might be around Rs700bn.
The M6 project was supposed to be completed within 24 months after its groundbreaking in Dec 2022 by then PM Shehbaz Sharif, who has just taken oath of his office for a new term. However, a mega corruption scam jeopardised the project after embezzlement was reported in Matiari and Naushahro Feroz districts, both left bank districts of the province. The motorway section is to pass through seven districts of Sindh.
“In 80pc cases [of project execution], we have land available with us,” said an official while alluding to the land acquisition issue that was otherwise marred by the Oct 2022 scam. A handsome amount was recovered by Sindh government and now the matter is pending a trial before the Hyderabad Accountability Court.
The land acquisition process was not halted. NHA had transferred Rs15bn for land acquisition to Sindh government.
It may be recalled that the then officials like deputy commissioners of Matiari and Naushahro Feroze were allegedly involved in the land acquisition scam. Naushahro Feroze DC Tashfeen Alam Khan fled abroad while Matiari DC Adnan Rashdi was arrested, besides Saeedabad AC Mansoor Abbasi.
In all, 42 characters were booked in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) reference. Bail pleas of the prime accused has already been rejected and a couple of others have opted for plea bargain.

The university’s vice chancellor, Prof Dr Tauha Hussain Ali, said at the youths’ moot that students were brand ambassadors of MUET and the time and energy spent by teachers on their students would go a long way in shaping their careers.
He said that it was indeed encouraging to see students arguing in the model UN committee sessions. Learning something new and recreating oneself were the most appreciable achievements a man could attain, he said. 
He said that these conferences were organised with a serious purpose of helping students know issues confronting the society. The students also learned about present day challenges being faced by member states of the United Nations, he said. 
He said that MUET had been holding the model UN sessions for last one decade and these had almost become a permanent feature of the varsity.
Prof Dr Aftab Ahmed Memon said that universities were supposed to instill confidence and discipline in students besides helping them achieve academic brilliance.
