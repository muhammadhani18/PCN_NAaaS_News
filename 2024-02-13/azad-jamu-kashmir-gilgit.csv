During Monday’s hearing, the SSP Investigation informed the court that he was ashamed of the arrest made by a police officer from the IHC premises. 
“Generally, arrest is not made from the court premises. I don't know why it happened in this case. The concerned ASI has been suspended and further investigation are under way,” he informed the court.
In his remarks, the IHC judge told the police officer that the purpose of calling him in person was to inform the police that arrests were being made from the court premises. “She is a woman and as soon as she left this court she was arrested. You know the facts. An FIR was registered in May, 2023. We asked if there was any other case and we were told that there was no case. However, when she went out, she was arrested,” the judge remarked.
The court directed the SSP Investigation to immediately hold a meeting with the IGP and inform the court of the outcome within two days. The court adjourned further hearing of the case until Thursday.
