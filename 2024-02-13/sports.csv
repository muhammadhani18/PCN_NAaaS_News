3,"Everyone busy in polls, city in a mess","With staff of civic bodies on election duties, heaps of garbage pile up; roads remain inundated, sewers clogged","Amidst the fervour of the general elections, Karachi, the metropolitan hub, found itself engulfed in chaos as heaps of garbage, overflowing sewerage, and deteriorating roads marred the cityscape, leaving citizens grappling with numerous challenges in commuting.
Despite the administrative and civic agencies' ostensibly busy schedules during the election period, the reality on the ground painted a starkly different picture. Public transport services remained scant, exacerbating the difficulties faced by residents navigating through the urban sprawl.
The disruption in Karachi's routine affairs stemmed from the holiday observed on February 5, coinciding with the Election Day. Local representatives affiliated with various political parties were preoccupied with election campaigns, throwing their weight behind their respective candidates.

The absence of essential services exacerbated the situation further. The staff of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board failed to report for duty, resulting in the accumulation of thousands of tons of waste across the city. Similarly, the Water Corporation personnel were conspicuous by their absence, neglecting crucial cleaning tasks in affected areas. Many officers from these agencies were deployed for election duties or chose to extend their holidays, compounding the city's sanitation woes.
The breakdown of the sewerage system aggravated the situation, with multiple locations such as Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Korangi, MA Jinnah Road, Bahadurabad, Tariq Road, North Nazimabad, and PIB Colony bearing the brunt of neglect.
Furthermore, the state of disrepair of city roads added to the citizens' woes. While some roads fall under the jurisdiction of local town administrations, others, including main thoroughfares, are the responsibility of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
As Karachi grapples with these pressing issues, it underscores the urgent need for concerted efforts from both administrative bodies and elected representatives to address the city's longstanding infrastructure and sanitation challenges, especially during critical periods like elections.

The SHO B-Section police station Muhammad Anwar Laghari, who is complainant in the FIR, said three of the attackers were identified while the police have apprehended two of them including the MNA-elect Irfan Laghari and his Qambar Laghari. 
Qamabar while talking to the media said they had not intentionally attacked the army soldiers. He added that they have high regards for the soldiers and that they cannot even think of opening fire on them.
The police have booked the suspects under section 6/7 of Anti-Terrorism Act and sections 148, 149, 324 and 353 of Pakistan Penal Code. 
Amid high security, the suspects were taken from Dadu to Anti-Terrorism Court in Naushehro Feroze. But due to absence on leave of the judge, the accused were produced before the Session Judge who granted their jail remand till February 16.
The PPP's opponents from the Grand Democratic Alliance in Dadu have blamed the winning candidates for rigging the results. 
The successful candidates, on their part, deny the charges and claim that their services during the previous government and popularity of the PPP's leadership had won them votes.
