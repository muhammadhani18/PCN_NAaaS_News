0,Google commits $26.9m to Europe for AI,Firm has expanded its free online AI training courses to 18 languages,"Google has pledged 25 million euros ($26.98 million) to help people in Europe learn to use artificial intelligence (AI). Announcing the funding on Monday, the tech giant said it had opened applications for social enterprises and non-profits that could help reach those most likely to benefit from training.
The firm will also run a series of “growth academies” to support companies using AI to scale their companies and has expanded its free online AI training courses to 18 languages.

“Research shows that the benefits of AI could exacerbate existing inequalities, especially in terms of economic security and employment,” said Adrian Brown, executive director of the Centre for Public Impact, which is running the nonprofit scheme alongside Google.
“This new programme will help people across Europe develop their knowledge, skills and confidence around AI, ensuring that no one is left behind.” Last month, Google announced it would invest $1 billion into building a data centre just outside of London, as it moves to meet growing demand for internet services in the region.
The data centre, located on a 33-acre site bought by Google in 2020, will be located in Waltham Cross.

1,Remittances soar to 3-month high,"Surge by 26% to reach $2.39b in January 2024, signalling confidence in economy","The inflows of workers’ remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis reached a three-month high at $2.39 billion in January 2024, instilling confidence in the domestic economy following the disbursement of the second loan tranche of $700 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the same month.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), remittances surged by 26% to $2.39 billion in January compared to $1.90 billion in the corresponding month of the previous year. This marked a nearly 1% increase from the $2.38 billion received in December 2023.
However, cumulatively in the first seven months (Jul-Jan) of the current fiscal year 2023-24, remittances remained 3% lower at $15.83 billion compared to $16.32 billion in the same period of the previous year.
SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed had anticipated late last month in January that remittances would grow in the second half (Jan-Jun) of the fiscal year 2023-24, following the announcement of incentives aimed at attracting higher remittances. Additionally, the outlook for the global economy has improved in recent months, supporting non-resident Pakistanis in earning and sending more money back home.
He projected that remittance receipts would increase to $28 billion for the full fiscal year 2023-24, compared to $27 billion in the previous fiscal year 2022-23.
Central bank data suggests that remittance inflows have been comparatively higher in each of the last four months (Oct-Jan) compared to the same months in the previous year.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Arif Habib Limited, Head of Research, Tahir Abbas said that remittances are expected to remain high with two Eid festivals falling within the last five months of fiscal year 2023-24.
“Historical data suggests that remittances peak around the Eid festivals,” he stated.
According to central bank data, remittances reached their highest levels of $2.53 billion in fiscal year 2022-23 and $3.12 billion in fiscal year 2021-22 during the months coinciding with the festivals.
Abbas said that his research house has estimated that full-year remittances for fiscal year 2023-24 would range between $28.5 billion and $29 billion, close to the IMF projection of $29.4 billion for the year.
He stressed the need to address the recent political turmoil in the country through dialogue to maintain stability in remittances and economic activities. Additionally, the government’s new economic roadmap would provide direction to overseas Pakistanis regarding remittance flows.

Government efforts towards securing a new IMF loan programme at the completion of the current one of $3 billion in March 2024 will also be a significant development which the world will observe before taking financial decisions for Pakistan.
Market discussions indicate that the latest receipt of the IMF loan tranche has instilled new confidence in local businesses, financial and capital markets, and Pakistan’s foreign Eurobonds in global markets. Pakistani expatriates have demonstrated confidence in the country by sending higher remittances to their families and friends back home.
Abbas recalled that remittances began improving after the outgoing caretaker government cracked down on foreign currency smugglers in early September 2023. This crackdown significantly curbed illegal outflows, resulting in an increased supply of US dollars in the domestic economy. As a result, the Pakistani currency has appreciated by almost 10% in the past five months to $279.33/$ in the interbank market as of Monday.
The restoration of stability in the rupee-dollar exchange rate and the crackdown on illicit hawala-hundi operators have encouraged more overseas Pakistanis to send funds through official channels such as banks and registered exchange companies.
Region-wise remittance inflows
Remittances from Saudi Arabia increased by 43% to $587 million in January 2024 compared to $409 million in the same month of the previous year.
Remittances from the UAE rose by 51% to $408 million in January compared to $270 million in the corresponding month of the previous year.
Pakistanis sent 9% higher remittances from the UK, amounting to $362 million compared to $331 million.
Remittances from EU countries increased by 20% to $290 million compared to $242 million. The diaspora sent $283 million from the US, marking a growth of 32% compared to $214 million. Remittances from other countries totalled $467 million in January, exhibiting an 8% increase from $433 million in the same month of the previous year.

2,High taxes weigh on tobacco industry,"Lead to 40% decline in production, ineffective T&T system results in losses of over Rs310b","The legitimate tobacco industry in Pakistan faces a severe crisis, with heavy taxes on tobacco products leading to a significant decrease in production and substantial tax losses.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, legal cigarette production has plummeted by 40% in just five months due to the widening price gap between legal and illegal cigarettes, primarily attributed to increased excise duty. Between July and November of the current fiscal year, the legal cigarette industry witnessed a staggering 39.31% decrease in production, a figure four times higher than the average decline in other large-scale manufacturing industries.
Overall, large-scale manufacturing output experienced an average decline of 0.80% during the same period, marking a negative 10.3% in the twelve months of the previous fiscal year. The production of the tobacco industry as a whole decreased by 39.31% from July to November 2023, with tax-paying tobacco companies recording a 28.4% decrease in production during the twelve months of the previous fiscal year.
The average monthly legal production of cigarettes also saw a substantial drop from 4.41 billion cigarettes in the first nine months of 2022 to 2.836 billion cigarettes in the same period of 2023.
One major contributing factor to the economic setback is the ineffective implementation of the Track & Trace system within the tobacco sector, resulting in a staggering loss of over Rs310 billion. Despite this significant revenue loss, the government and authorities seem hesitant to take decisive action against illicit cigarette manufacturers.

Read Strict T&T system a must: tobacco industry
Head of Investment Banking at Intermarket Securities, Syed Saifullah Kazmi, stated that “The legal tobacco companies contributed Rs241 billion in taxes during the current financial year.” However, he noted a massive loss of Rs310 billion due to tax evasion by illicit cigarette manufacturers, underscoring that this revenue could have been utilised for the betterment of the economy.
Kazmi suggests the implementation and enforcement of the Track & Trace system, targeted enforcement against illicit trade across the value chain with a focus on the retail level, and the implementation of fiscal measures as crucial steps to control illicit trade in the tobacco industry. These proposed changes aim to not only curb tax evasion but also contribute to the economic growth of the country.

3,Rupee dips slightly but largely stable,Rupee remains largely stable at Rs279.33 against US dollar in the inter-bank market,"Although Pakistani currency dipped slightly, it remained largely stable at Rs279.33 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Monday as heightened political turmoil in the country following general elections did not leave a large impact on the currency.
According to SBP data, the rupee ticked down 0.02%, or Rs0.03, against the greenback on a day-on-day basis, ending its three-day winning streak. The currency market came under moderate pressure, though the central bank reported improvement in workers’ remittances to $2.4 billion for January 2024. It indicated that the supply of foreign currency remained better in the inter-bank network.

Read Rupee ticks up to 3-1/2-month high
The latest decrease in the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves, however, forced importers to pay a higher price for purchasing the US dollar. The bank reported on Friday evening that the reserves dropped $173 million to $8.04 billion on foreign debt repayments in the week ended on February 2. The currency has cumulatively gained 9.96%, or Rs27.82, in the past five months, reaching a three-and-a-half-month high at Rs279.28.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported that the currency dropped 0.06%, or Rs0.18, and closed at Rs281.19/$ in the open market. Treasury firm Tresmark projected on Saturday that the rupee would remain stable and may improve to Rs272/$ in the first two weeks post-general elections held on Thursday last week. The emergence of heightened political instability in the aftermath of alleged tampering with election results is likely to prevent the rupee from notching up further gains. Any hung parliament may deal a blow to the economic achievements made over the past few months under the caretaker administration.

4,Debt burden surges to record high of Rs81.2 trillion,Debt and liabilities increase by another Rs17.4tr as of end-Dec,"Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities have peaked at Rs81.2 trillion – a figure that grew at a faster pace of over 27% during the past year, posing emergent management challenges to the newly elected government.
The bulletin released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday showed that the country’s total debt and liabilities increased by another Rs17.4 trillion as of the end of December compared to the previous year.
The total debt and liabilities now stand at Rs81.2 trillion, including Rs4.6 trillion in liabilities. The government accumulated debt at a rate of 27.2%, averaging Rs48 billion per day since December 2022. This is one of the highest monthly increases in public debt, which includes five months of the caretaker government.
Managing public debt and the growing cost of interest payments will be one of the paramount challenges for the newly elected government and may require tough decisions. However, a visibly weak coalition government may find such choices hard, particularly when there are ideological differences among potential coalition partners.
The Ministry of Finance’s latest Fiscal Policy Statement 2024 also showed a sharp rise in the debt burden during the fiscal year 2022-23, which was the year when the Pakistan Democratic Movement ruled Pakistan.
The debt burden of every citizen jumped by 25.2% to Rs271,624 by the end of the previous fiscal year. In absolute terms, every person’s debt burden increased by Rs54,500 within one year, according to the statement.
The SBP debt bulletin showed that the country paid Rs4.4 trillion in just interest costs during the first half of this fiscal year, which was Rs1.7 trillion or two-thirds higher than the same period of the last fiscal year.
The cost of servicing the debt cannot be diminished until the central bank reduces the key policy rate and the government negotiates with commercial banks for a reduction.
However, the party manifestos of the PPP and the PML-N do not offer any solution to the growing debt burden, except betting on a reduction in interest rates to reduce the annual debt cost. But any such reduction would be offset by the new amount of debt that the government will have to take to remain afloat.

Read PDM economic management led to sharp rise in per capita debt
The gross public debt, which falls under the direct responsibility of the finance ministry, totalled Rs67.3 trillion by the end of December, according to SBP data. There was also an increase of Rs14.5 trillion or 27.4% in gross public debt in one year.
In the previous fiscal year, the federal budget deficit soared to a record Rs6.7 trillion, attributed to the expansionary and politically motivated fiscal policies of the PDM government. The surge in public debt exceeded the budget deficit, indicating the impact of currency devaluation.
During their respective five-year terms, the PML-N added approximately Rs10 trillion, the PPP Rs8 trillion, and the PTI alone accumulated over Rs19 trillion in public debt.
The burden will persist until significant reforms are initiated, including reviews of provincial projects, winding up of ministries operating in areas now under provincial control, and addressing debt expenses.
The main reasons behind the surge in public debt remain lower-than-targeted tax collection, steep currency devaluation, higher interest rates, increased expenditures, losses by state-owned companies, and mismanagement of debt. Public Sector Enterprises’ debt and liabilities reached Rs3.9 trillion by the end of December, surging by one-fifth and reflecting uncontrolled losses by these enterprises. No government has taken steps to reform state-owned enterprises.
Political appointees fill the boards of these SOEs, including interim Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, who sits on the boards of the Pakistan Stock Exchange and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited. The Auditor General Pakistan has framed an audit objection over the unknown amounts of board fees paid to the officers of the finance ministry sitting on 60 such boards.
The SBP data showed that the average exchange rate at the end of December was Rs281.9, depreciating by 264.4%, significantly impacting the government’s external debt. The external debt also increased 26% to reach Rs33.6 trillion within a year, with a net increase of Rs7 trillion, primarily due to currency depreciation and foreign currency reserve building through borrowing.
The country’s debt from the IMF grew by 30% to reach Rs2.14 trillion by the end of December, according to the SBP.

5,Edible oil industry advocates tax reform,"Calls for reduced duty on crude palm oil, abolishing section 8B of Sales Tax Act","Edible oil manufacturers have called for reducing the duty on Crude Palm Oil (CPO), abolishing section 8B of the Sales Tax Act, and enhancing taxes on commercial importers. The aim is to encourage farmers and others to boost industrial growth in the country.
They reported that over 3.2 million metric tonnes of palm oil are imported into the country. The edible oil sector sources raw materials from domestic and global sources, manufacturing 4.5 million metric tonnes of standardised and high-quality Banaspati and cooking oil to meet the national demand.
While speaking to The Express Tribune, they noted that the edible oil sector’s annual turnover exceeds Rs2,400 billion per annum. Manufacturers contribute up to Rs550 billion directly or indirectly to the national exchequer in terms of duties, taxes, and other levies. This sector ranks among the top five revenue spinners of the country, as announced by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Ministry of Finance. The oil palm industry is a pillar of the country’s economy and plays a key role in meeting the ever-growing national demand.
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President and former chairman of the Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association (PVMA), Atif Ikram Sheikh stressed the need for more economic and political stability in the country to promote industrialisation and bolster the national economy, benefiting all industrialists and the business community.
Discussing numerous issues in the edible oil industry, he reiterated his previous statement that section 8B of the Sales Tax Act 1990 should be abolished. He pointed out that the 10% differential, disfavouring and discouraging industrialists compared to commercial importers, should be eliminated, as it disrupts cash flow.
He further suggested that higher tariffs should be imposed on commercial importers than on industries to facilitate local industries. There should be a significant difference in tariffs between manufacturers and commercial importers, with manufacturers receiving lower rates.
Finally, he called for reducing duty on Crude Palm Oil (CPO) since many refineries are closed due to the high duty on crude palm oil. He noted that in the past, there was less duty on the import of crude palm oil, resulting in better industrial growth.

Read Increase local production of edible oil: experts
Speaking about oil palm plantations in the country, he mentioned that both the local industry and the government are working on it. Previous attempts were made, and oil palm fruits also grew, but proper yield was not achieved due to certain weather conditions such as excessive rains.
He mentioned that the stakeholders have resumed their efforts, expressing hope that fresh fruit would yield abundant harvests in regions like Thatta and Sujawal, where weather conditions favour fruit cultivation.
“The government is currently unable to offer direct assistance to the industry. However, it should consider increasing taxes on commercial importers to create more room for the local industry to grow and thrive. Currently, the industry pays an 18% sales tax and 2% income tax, while commercial importers pay the same sales tax and 3% income tax. The government should contemplate imposing a 20% to 22% sales tax and a 5% income tax on commercial importers, thereby discouraging them,” remarked KK Group of Industries CEO Khalid Islam Sheikh.
He stressed that if the government formulates favourable and supportive policies, it would incentivise farmers to cultivate more sunflower, canola, and soybean instead of concentrating solely on wheat.
“Approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million metric tonnes of canola, sunflower, and soybean seeds are imported for oil extraction purposes. By increasing import duties on these seeds, the government can encourage growers to cultivate more of these crops for subsequent harvests and also supply seeds to the industry. Consequently, this policy would reduce the import bill for seeds,” he added.
Wrapping up his remarks, he noted, “During a two-month season, we solely rely on domestic cottonseed oil to meet a local demand of 200,000 to 250,000 metric tonnes. However, this oil is predominantly consumed by other industries.”

6,IMF chief confident on soft landing,Cautions to expect the unexpected in wake of Covid-19 pandemic,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is now “very confident” the global economy will see a soft landing, its Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Monday, adding that interest rates would start coming down around mid-year.
“We are very confident that the world economy is now poised for this soft landing we have been dreaming for,” after some of the sharpest interest rate hikes in decades, Georgieva said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.
On the prospect of interest rates being cut in leading economies like the United States, she added, “I expect to see by mid-year interest rates going in the direction inflation has been going on for the last year.”
She cautioned to expect the unexpected in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and said a prolonged war between Israel and Hamas would impact global economies.
“I fear most a longevity of the conflict because (if) it goes on and on the risk of spillovers go up,” the IMF chief said.

“Right now we see a risk of spillover from the Suez Canal,” she said referring to recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea. “But if there are other unintended consequences in terms of where the fighting goes, then it can become much more problematic for the world as a whole.”
A day ago, Georgieva said Middle East economies were lagging below growth projections due to oil production cuts and the Israel-Gaza conflict, even as the global economic outlook remained resilient.
Despite uncertainties, “the global economy has been surprisingly resilient,” the IMF managing director told the Arab Fiscal Forum in Dubai, while warning of a potential wider impact on regional economies of continued conflict in Gaza.

7,No obstacles to SME listing at stock market,Many issues addressed to allay concerns of investors,"There is a misconception among businessmen and people that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) cannot be listed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), said a leading businessman. In this regard, many issues have been resolved to address concerns of investors.
While presiding over an awareness session, organised in collaboration with the PSX, Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President Kashif Anwar said that companies should be listed at the stock market as it would provide them with a lot of benefits.
He voiced hope that liaison between the Lahore Chamber and PSX would prove to be very fruitful.
Anwar called the bourse an important indicator to examine the health of economy. “Currently, Pakistan Stock Exchange is performing well,” he said.
He added that the purpose of the awareness session was to inform LCCI members about the PSX, encourage them to get their companies listed on it and highlight issues of capital and liquidity.
Speaking on the occasion, PSX Director Ahmad Chinoy said that the PSX had taken various initiatives and people were being informed about its benefits through a door-to-door campaign.

He stressed that they were spreading awareness about listing at the PSX, investment and other matters. “This is the best forum for investors. Listed companies make people shareholders at market value. This brings diversified experience and provides a better advice.”
Chinoy announced that they had introduced reforms in the stock market where a company could get listing certificate in just 29 days.
This turns local companies into international brands and also improves their profile. At present, 534 elite companies are listed at the stock exchange and “our local companies will also get the status of elite companies by getting listed on the bourse”.
He emphasised that the entry of domestic companies into the PSX would lead to the development of the economy and increase market capitalisation. At the event, where PSX CEO Farrukh Khan was also present, a detailed presentation was given about the aims and objectives of the bourse.

8,Riyadh cites transition for oil capacity U-turn,Halt in oil expansion plan to reach net zero emissions by 2060,"Saudi Arabia’s U-turn on its oil capacity expansion plans was because of the energy transition, its energy minister said on Monday, adding that the kingdom has plenty of spare capacity to cushion the oil market.
The Saudi government on January 30 ordered state oil company Aramco to halt its oil expansion plan and target maximum sustained production capacity of 12 million barrels per day (bpd), 1 million bpd below a target announced in 2020 and set to be reached in 2027.
“I think we postponed this investment simply because ... we’re transitioning,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at the IPTC petroleum technology conference in Dharan, adding that Aramco has other investments to make in areas including oil, gas, petrochemicals and renewables.
Saudi Arabia has said it aims to reach net zero emissions by 2060, with Aramco targeting net zero emissions from its own operations by 2050.
Prince Abdulaziz said that the kingdom had a “huge cushion” of spare oil capacity in case of major disruptions to global supplies caused by conflict or natural disasters.
Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser told reporters on the sidelines of the same conference that the state oil giant remained ready to raise capacity should it be needed. “We have adequate spare capacity of about 3 million barrels,” Nasser said.
“And as a company – because this is a decision for the government – we remain ready whenever they want to increase MSC (maximum sustained capacity); we are always ready to expand.”

Read Oil rises 1%, heads for weekly gain
Under cuts agreed by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, together known as OPEC+, Saudi oil production is about 3 million bpd below its 12 million bpd maximum sustainable capacity, making it the world’s biggest holder of spare capacity.
“We are ready to tweak upward, downward, whatever the market necessity dictates,” Prince Abdulaziz said.
He criticised a decision coordinated by the International Energy Agency in 2022 to release oil from emergency reserves to cool global prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“Why should we be the last country to hold energy capacity, or emergency capacity, when it is unappreciated and when it is not recognised?”
Nasser said he expected oil demand to increase to 104 million bpd this year and to 105 million bpd in 2025, downplaying suggestions that it will peak soon. OPEC figures show oil demand reached a record of more than 102 million bpd last year.

9,Political turmoil rattles PSX,"Benchmark KSE-100 index dives 1,878.43 points, settles at 61,065.32","As political uncertainty deepened in the wake no clear majority for any political party in general elections, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plunged on Monday, giving up nearly 1,900 points as investors resorted to panic selling to avoid hefty losses.
The market slumped despite announcement of robust financial results and a 26% year-on-year (YoY) surge in remittances that amounted to $2.4 billion in January 2024.
In the morning, the trading day commenced on a relatively positive note, with the KSE-100 index touching the intra-day high at 62,634.37 points. However, it started falling rapidly from that point onwards owing to heightened selling pressure, primarily sparked by the growing political noise and the delay in circular debt management plan, where the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) approval was pending.
Additional factors that contributed to the downturn included Bloomberg’s assessment of default risks, Moody’s rating concerns in the face of political instability, policy uncertainty and high leveraged positions at the PSX.
The index reached its intra-day low at 60,647.67 points about an hour before close of trading. However, value hunters seized the opportunity to make selective purchases of attractive stocks, which helped to erase some prior losses.
Exploration and production (E&P), power, and cement sectors registered significant declines and the bourse closed the day slightly above the 61,000-point mark.
“Stocks fell sharply on election deadlock and political turmoil after the announcement of general election results,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Strong financial results and upbeat data showing $2.4 billion in remittances, which surged 26% YoY in January 2024, supported the index to close above the day’s low,” he said, adding that caution by Bloomberg about default risk, Moody’s rating concerns over political instability, policy uncertainty and high leveraged positions at the PSX played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the stock market.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a plunge of 1,878.43 points, or 2.98%, and settled at 61,065.32.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, said that “continuing last week’s momentum, Pakistan equities commenced business on a negative note.”

“The aforesaid selling spree can be attributed to further delay in the circular debt management plan where the IMF’s nod is awaited and may likely be received this week, as informed by the Petroleum Division,” it said.
In addition, uncertainty on the political front about the formation of a new government dampened market sentiment.
Resultantly, E&P, power and cement sectors contributed negatively to the KSE-100 index as Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Mari Petroleum, Hub Power and Lucky Cement lost a total of 640 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that only three stocks rose while 88 shares fell on the KSE-100 index. Oil and Gas Development Company (-7.5%), Pakistan Petroleum (-7.5%) and Mari Petroleum (-5.59%) were the biggest contributors to the decline.
It added that the MSCI would announce results of its February 2024 Index Review later in the day, which could be beneficial for Pakistan concerning passive flows at the end of the month.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal stated that the market sentiment weakened owing to the lack of clarity on the political front. “Delay in reforms, upcoming debt repayments and currency devaluation are the key concerns,” he pointed out.
“Going forward, we recommend investors to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy in banking and fertiliser sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 349.97 million shares against Friday’s tally of 258.1 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.7 billion.
Shares of 354 companies were traded. Of these, 35 stocks closed higher, 300 dropped and 19 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 50.3 million shares, losing Rs0.44 to close at Rs4.21. It was followed by WordCall Telecom with 34.6 million shares, losing Rs0.07 to close at Rs1.21 and Oil and Gas Development Company with 14.9 million shares, losing Rs10.88 to close at Rs134.20.
On a day when many investors opted for heavy selling, foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs808.5 million, according to the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL).
