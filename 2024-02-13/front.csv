0,LHC dismisses 18 PTI pleas against election results,Courts issue notices to election commission on several other petitions,"The Lahore High Court dismissed petitions challenging the election results of 18 national and provincial constituencies, deeming them inadmissible. Meanwhile, the high courts in Karachi and Peshawar have summoned the Election Commission to respond to similar challenges.
Courts nationwide are inundated with electoral disputes as numerous candidates contest provisional results in hopes of altering outcomes. Most challengers are independents backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
Multiple petitions have been heard in high courts in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar, contesting discrepancies between Form 47, issued by returning officers (ROs), and the data on Form 45. Form 45 is the primary document containing candidate vote data per polling station, while Form 46 details ballot handling.
Form 47 provides candidate vote breakdowns based on all Form 45s, offering unofficial results. Form 48 compiles total candidate votes in a constituency, while Form 49—the Gazetted Form—presents the official outcome.
In the Lahore High Court, Justice Ali Baqir Najafi presided over the petitions. Following arguments, the court reserved its ruling, later pronouncing the reserved judgment that the petitions were inadmissible and thus dismissed.
Among those contested were the electoral victories of prominent figures such as Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders Maryam Nawaz, Khawaja Asif, and Aun Chaudhry of Istehkam-e-Pakistan (IPP).
In its verdicts, the court directed petitioners to seek redressal from the Election Commission under the Election Act. The Election Commission would then determine whether to compile results with or without the applicant's presence, adhering to the Election Act.
Challenges in the LHC included constituencies such as NA-117 with Aleem Khan, NA-119 with Maryam Nawaz, NA-126 with Malik Saiful Mulook Khokhar, NA-127 with Atta Tarar, NA-128 with Aun Chaudhry, NA-117 with Khawaja Asif, NA-80 with Shahid Usman, and NA-87 with Malik Shakir Bashir Awan.
Additionally, challenges extended to Punjab Assembly constituencies including PP-167 with Irfan Shafi Khokhar, PP-169 with Malik Khalid Khokhar, PP-46 with Faisal Ikram, PP-47 with Chaudhry Muhammad Mansha, and PP-53 with Rana Abdul Sattar.
In the Sindh High Court (SHC), a two-member bench, led by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, issued notices to the Election Commission and the Federation for February 13 (today) regarding all petitions contesting the results of 40 constituencies of the national and provincial assembly in Karachi.
During proceedings, Barrister Farogh Naseem, representing the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), questioned the maintainability of the petitions. Barrister Salahuddin, counsel for the petitioners, emphasized their desire for returning officers (ROs) to tally Form 45 in the candidates' presence.
Chief Justice Abbasi inquired whether any applications had been submitted to the Election Commission, highlighting the Commission's authority, including the ability to order re-polling in entire constituencies. He cautioned against disrupting the electoral process at this stage.
Barrister Salahuddin urged the bench to direct the Election Commission to halt notification issuance and consider their requests before making a decision. However, Barrister Naseem opposed such instructions, preferring to allow the Election Commission to carry out its duties.
The chief justice clarified to the Election Commission's counsel that the court wasn't issuing orders but warned against any attempt to be cunning. Notices were issued to the Election Commission and the Federation for February 13.
Similarly, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) issued notices to the Election Commission and summoned the returning officers of the relevant constituencies for February 15 regarding petitions filed by leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf alleging result tampering.
A two-member bench, comprising Justice Shakeel Ahmed and Justice Syed Arshad Ali, heard petitions from Sajid Nawaz, Taimoor Salim Jhagra, Mehmood Jan, Kamran Bangash, Arrab Jehandad, Mohammad Asim, Ali Zaman, Malik Shahab, and Syed Farin.

Petitioners' lawyers argued that Form 45s favored their clients, showing significant leads, but final results on Form 47s were altered. They sought to halt result issuance.
Justice Shakeel Ahmed questioned the Election Commission’s lawyer about Form 48 and Form 49 issuance. The lawyer confirmed Form 49 issuance for most Peshawar constituencies. Justice Arshad Ali noted that if Form 49 was issued, the court couldn't suspend it.
Justice Ali clarified that the court couldn't instruct the Election Commission to recount votes. Shumail Butt, petitioner's counsel, clarified they weren't requesting a recount but urging result announcement per Form 45.
Lawyers of successful candidates argued against case hearings, while petitioners' lawyers requested an injunction on result declaration. Justice Ali highlighted the court's limited jurisdiction in such cases.
The court issued notices to the Election Commission and summoned ROs for February 15. During the hearing, a female officer presented a plea, leading to the court adjourning proceedings for simultaneous hearing of all petitions.
Meanwhile, the Election Commission stopped the issuance of final results of NA-52, NA-53, NA-56, NA-57, NA-60, and NA-69, NA-87, NA-106, NA-126 and NA-127, besides Punjab Assembly’s constituencies of PP-4, PP-6, PP-7, PP-12, PP-15, PP-17, PP-33, PP-43, PP-53, PP-121, PP-126, PP-128, PP-133 and PP-279.
The Election Commission also stopped the final result of two Balochistan Assembly constituencies, PB-14 and PB-44 Quetta. The Election Commission also ordered re-polling at 7 polling stations of NA-253 and PB-9 in Balochistan.
The Election Commission has formed two benches to hear the election related matters. It took up a complaint against IPP’s Firdous Ashiq Awan regarding slapping an official. The lawyers for Awan sought the copy of the complaint. The bench accepted the plea and adjourned the matter.
On PTI-supported candidate Ayaz Amir's request pertaining to the results of NA-58 and NA-59 Chakwal the ECP bench issued notices to the RO concerned. The commission reserved its decision on a petition related to the snatching of the polling material in PS-19 Ghotki.
The case of 6 polling stations in NA-43 Tank, where no vote was cast, was also heard. The RO concerned said that the polling could not be held because of the deteriorating law and order situation.
He added that some polling staff could not reach the polling stations, while a presiding officer was injured in firing.
Separately, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, requesting the apex court to declare the February 8 general elections null and void and order fresh elections under Judicial Supervision.
The petitioner Ali Khan said in his petition,” seeking justice and redressal for the grave injustices and irregularities witnessed during the general elections held on the 8th of February 2024”. He requested the court to order fresh elections under the supervision of the Judiciary.

1,Bilawal wants to see Zardari become president,PPP chairman say his party won’t join govt,"Sensing the dangers in supporting a weak government at the Centre after the recently concluded elections sprang a hung parliament, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Tuesday offered the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz support in forming its government at the Centre but in return sought to see his father, Asif Ali Zardari, become president.
""We will support a political party without becoming part of the government,"" the PPP chairman said while addressing a news conference after attending the Central Executive Committee meeting in the federal capital.
The announcement would to some extent help end an atmosphere of stalemate after the Feb 8 vote gave a split verdict, sparking worries of fresh political instability in the country.
Bilawal said his party wasn't interested in a new alliance with the PML-N but would support any government formed by them on certain issues.
""But we will support the votes of prime ministership, budget, and legislation on an issue-to-issue basis,"" he said.
The former foreign minister said he would like to see his father become president again.
""And I am not saying this because he is my father. I am saying this because the country is in a huge crisis at the moment and if anyone has the capacity to douse this flame, it is Asif Ali Zardari,"" he said.
The move is seen in the political circles as a bargaining chip given the fact that the head of state usually enjoys a secure five-year term and the president is immune to any corruption charges as long as he sits in the presidency.
Zardari, who served as the president of the country during from 2008 to 2013, has faced corruption allegations throughout his political life so far.
He faced a myriad of cases in courts but comes out unscathed – thanks to his political sagacity and skills.
Besides, it is believed that the PPP also wants the posts of National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman in addition to governors of its choice in the provinces.

In response to a question, Bilawal said all political forces needed to think about the country and end the politics of division.
“They must not just think about themselves … this way the enemies of the country would want to benefit from this crisis. It takes two to tango.”
The PML-N is the largest recognised party with 75 seats and the PPP is second with 54.
Together, the two parties have enough for a simple majority in the 264-seat legislature.
Independent candidates backed by jailed former premier Imran Khan have won 92 seats, making them the largest group, but they cannot form a government on their own, having run as individuals and not a party.
Bilawal’s chances of forming a government with the support of PTI-backed independents got slim after the PTI ruled out joining forces with the PML-N or the PPP. ""That leaves us with the PML-N which is the only political party in the National Assembly which has reached out to the PPP and invited us to join their government,"" he told the media.
In his news conference, the PPP chairman criticised the PTI’s political strategy of perpetual confrontation, saying the PTI’s refusal to speak to “any political party” reflected that they were creating an “environment of political instability”.
Bilawal alleged that the PTI wanted to continue an “extreme populist politics in which they want to play the role of a spoiler”.
He said the Imran Khan-led party wanted to de-legitimise as many democratic processes as possible.
“They believe it’s to their political benefit to spread chaos in this country.”

He said the PTI was taking decisions that were not favourable for democracy. “Saying that we will not talk with anyone, okay don’t. But why did the people give you a vote? They voted for you to resolve their problems … a political force must listen to others.
“When they don’t do that, it damages the country.”
On the contrary, the PPP chairman said: the PPP “does not want a perpetual economic crisis or a fresh election leading to a political crisis in the country”.
He stated that the PPP had today once again decided to raise the slogan of “Pakistan khappay” only for the sake of the country and in the interest of the people.
“We will support political parties without becoming part of the government in the shape of ministries or PDM 2 as people are saying. We will not become part of it.”
He added that if the PPP had not joined the PML-N, the country would have suffered.
""It cannot be that one party always raises objections against the poll results.
“We want all the political parties to address the shortcomings so that no one can point fingers at elections the next time. We will also utilise available forums like the ECP and parliament in addressing these issues,"" Bilawal said.
""We want a government at the Centre which should be allowed to function. I will not be putting myself forward for the candidacy of the prime minister of Pakistan,"" Bilawal said, adding that the PML-N and independents had a greater number at the Centre.
Bilawal said the PPP decided to form a committee to engage with other political parties for the formation of government and political stability.

“The PPP has decided that we are unable or not in a position to join the federal government ourselves, nor are we interested in taking ministries in such a set-up. We also don’t want to see political chaos in the country,” he said.
“The PPP has decided that we ran this election on a manifesto based on issues of public importance. We want to restore political stability and want to end this environment of political toxicity.
“To that end, the PPP will be willing to support the case of important votes — a candidate of the PM of Pakistan — and issue to issue basis to ensure that the government is formed and political stability is restored,” Bilawal said.
Separately, PPP Co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari said that he and other political leaders gathered with him decided to form the government together.
“We will take Pakistan out of difficulty,” he said, adding that reconciliation was also needed and the PTI was included in that process.
“This is not that we want that the PTI does not enter reconciliation. It should and every other political force should come and talk with us. Our economic and defence agenda should be common. We should move forward with our commonalities and then make the house of Sharif and others successful so we can make Pakistan successful.”

2,PTI puts wheels in motion for coalition govt,"Imran green-lights coalition talks with all parties except PML-N, PPP, MQM-P","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday charted its own course for coalition-building at the Centre and in Punjab, hitching its wagon of independents to the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM).
The party’s founder and former prime minister Imran Khan also gave the green light to coalition with two parties, namely the MWM in the Centre and Punjab, and the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa for reserved seats.
PTI’s Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan announced the decision at a news conference in Islamabad.
“We're heading towards government formation in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, doubling down on efforts for the Centre, and figuring out what to do about the Punjab government,"" Hasan said.
""These are his (Imran’s) decisions, and we are going to implement them. We've already started working on them,"" he added.
In addition, he revealed that the incarcerated party leader has identified three parties - PML-N, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, and PPP - but beyond them, he's given the party the nod to reach out to all other political parties.
Imran has instructed the party to sit down with parties and partner with them to form not just a coalition government but a democratic authority.
Moreover, Amir Dogar was appointed as the party's chief whip in the National Assembly.
The party’s central information secretary said that Imran's directive for intra-party elections to be held as soon as possible also landed on the table, adding that he was determined to hold it as he was responsible for it.
“As per our estimates, around 180 seats were the PTI’s in the NA but whatever has come after reducing them is before you. The first precondition according to him (Imran) is that a government be allowed to form in line with the mandate the nation has given and be allowed to continue because only this would make it possible to increase the confidence and investment of overseas Pakistanis.”
The spokesperson asserted that approximately 65 seats had been ""absconded"" from the party, urging a swift restitution.

Imran emphasised a cautionary note for the “current power players”, urging them to reflect on their actions, saying that the rightful winners of the election deserve the opportunity to assume governance and should be accorded that right.
Meanwhile, in a media interaction at Adiala Jail, Imran Khan said that the PTI-backed candidates secured over 90 seats in the National Assembly, surpassing the PML-N with 75 seats.
Imran firmly ruled out the possibility of forming a coalition government with the PML-N, the PPP, and the MQM-P.
He accused the leaders of those parties of being ""the biggest money launderers"", directing his party leaders to engage in talks with other parties, excluding the three.
Imran announced that the PTI would challenge the election results.
""We will also approach the Supreme Court against the poll results,"" he added.
The former premier claimed to have gauged PTI's victory when PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif postponed his news conference, asserting that both Nawaz and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz, had suffered defeats in the elections.
Addressing the question of the prime ministerial post, Imran clarified that no decision had been reached, and discussions would be undertaken.
PTI demands Imran's release
Meanwhile, the PTI also demanded that the public mandate must be respected as it was pre-requisite for survival and strength of the state and Imran should be released instantly as he was the only leader who could pull the country out of the prevailing quagmire of problems.
The PTI spokesperson made it clear that the elements, who were hell-bent on desecration and snatching the mandate of the people to impose the criminals, were enemies of the country because such attempts would further widen the fissure between the state and the people, which would further weaken the state.
He hinted that there was a possibility of talks with everyone to bring political and economic stability in the country provided the stolen mandate was returned to the real representatives and the rightful people of the country.
He stated that the people, especially the young generation, under the leadership of the PTI founding chairman, gave the PTI the right to represent them in an unequivocal manner, and ignoring it would be tantamount to enmity with the county.
He went on to say that the nation had given a clear and unwavering expression of Imran Khan's leadership with their power of votes and only he had the ability to bring Pakistan out of the current untold crises.

3,PDM resurrected,"Nawaz takes a strategic backseat, nominates Shehbaz for PM slot; PDM leaders renew coalition in a bid to form govt","In a political plot twist, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday emerged as a leading contender to reclaim the reins of power, with his former coalition comrades – PPP, MQM, PML-Q, BAP, and IPP – once again rallying behind him.
The development came as his party chief, Nawaz Sharif, took a strategic backseat, nominating Shehbaz for the prime ministerial position and his daughter Maryam for the role of chief minister of Punjab.
A powerhouse gathering at PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat's Islamabad residence saw the heads of political parties, including Shehbaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, Khalid Maqbool Saddique, Chaudhry Shujaat, and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani (representing BAP), along with IPP President Aleem Khan, uniting for a joint press conference.
They declared unequivocal support for Shehbaz and pledged to tackle the country's issues jointly as a coalition government.
While the power-sharing formula remained under wraps, the undertones of the press conference hinted at Asif Ali Zardari's prospects for the next presidency of the country.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, in an earlier announcement supporting the PML-N-led coalition, advocated for Zardari as the next president for the nation's betterment. The former foreign minister declared the party’s intent to abstain from government portfolios, though it seemed this position would be limited to ministries and advisories.
However, the conspicuous absence of three key players—Nawaz Sharif, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Maulana Fazlur Rehman—from the press spectacle raised eyebrows. Nawaz Sharif, making a grand return after a four-year self-imposed exile, aimed for a record fourth term as prime minister, intending to steer Pakistan out of crises, per his party's narrative.
A notable of absence of Bilawal, who held a separate press conference in Islamabad following his party's CEC meeting, also did not go without notice. Similarly, the JUI-F chief, who led the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) alliance that ousted the PTI government, was also missing.
PML-N sources whisper that Nawaz Sharif's decision to step back from the PM race wasn't entirely voluntary, hinting at unspecified external factors that influenced his choice.
The emergence of PDM 2.0, with Shehbaz Sharif at its forefront, did not catch seasoned political observers off guard. The political grapevine had long predicted the scenario well before the elections.
It is an open secret that Shehbaz Sharif's cosy rapport with the current establishment positioned him as the anticipated PM successor, irrespective of voting patterns.

Zardari holds out olive branch to PTI
Former president Asif Ali Zardari opened the press conference, announcing the joint decision of the parties to form a government to alleviate the crises facing Pakistan.
Acknowledging the challenges of reconciliation, Zardari stressed the need to involve even PTI in crafting a shared economic agenda for the country.
In the same breath, he expressed the parties’ support for Shehbaz Sharif in his endeavours for public service
He stated that the remarks made during the elections were intended for that specific stage, and now that the election phase is over, they will collaborate. He added that there were no ideological differences between them.
Meanwhile, MQM convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui stated that his party’s sole priority was Pakistan, and through constitutional cooperation, it aims to strengthen democracy.
He mentioned that they had supported Shehbaz Sharif in the past and pledged to continue supporting him in the future.
As for his part, Chairman Senator Sadiq Sanjrani, representing BAP, conveyed that his party president Khalid Magsi couldn't be present himself and instead asked him to attend. He, too, expressed support for Shehbaz.
IPP President Aleem and PML-Q President Chaudhary Shujaat also announced their endorsement of Shehbaz.
Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari's perspective of moving forward and putting electoral differences aside, adding that the parliament would be formed soon, and their primary focus was on the challenges that lie ahead.
He highlighted that addressing economic stability, reducing debt, managing inflation, and fostering growth are among the critical challenges that they are determined to address on a war footing.
The former premier expressed that the purpose of the gathering was to declare acceptance of the split mandate. He extended gratitude to all the party leaders for their support.

Referring to the press conference held earlier in the day, he mentioned that if PTI-backed independent candidates, whom his party is actively courting to strengthen its position, have a majority in the house, they should proceed to form the government.
In such a scenario, Shehbaz assured that they would gladly and willingly take their place on the opposition benches and fulfil their role.
Regarding a question about Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s absence, with whom the PML-N leadership had not yet held their first post-election meeting, he explained that Maulana was occupied with other engagements.
Responding to a question about his economic plan, given the historic inflation during his outgoing term and a rudderless approach to critical issues, Shehbaz Sharif proudly stated that their most significant achievement was steering the country away from bankruptcy.
In response to another question concerning PPP and their participation in the coalition government, the PML-N president mentioned the establishment of committees tasked with determining the rules of engagement.
Regarding the allocation of power, he clarified that decisions on who receives what would be made through consensus.
He declared Maryam Nawaz as the party's choice for the coveted slot of CM Punjab. When asked if Zardari would be the next president, Shehbaz, in a lighter vein, remarked, ""We won't disappoint you.""
Shehbaz extended another invitation to all for a charter for the economy and urged the promotion of a charter of democracy. He emphasised the need for everyone to set aside their differences for the betterment of the country.
Earlier today, Shehbaz conducted a press conference in which he commended the chief election commissioner, the armed forces, and Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa along with his bench for their handling of the allegedly 'tainted' elections on February 8.
Throughout his address, he reiterated PTI's accusations of ""35 punctures"" during the 2013 elections to challenge its credibility in claiming rigging in the 2024 elections.
He asserted that the 2018 elections were extensively rigged and despite their grievances, the party refrained from organising long marches or rallies and avoided causing damage to public or private property.
However, in making this claim, Shehbaz seemed to overlook the protest rally they organised against the election results in Islamabad and the numerous rallies and marches conducted by his party and its coalition partners throughout PTI's four-year tenure.
He recalled that all elections were rife with allegations of rigging, and this occurrence was not exclusive to the recent elections.
He questioned the possibility of rigging in this election by pointing out the losses of PML-N stalwarts from Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Abbottabad.
However, he expressed regret over the media, which, on the first night of the elections, he started shaping an impression in favour of independent candidates and against political parties despite only receiving 10 per cent of the results.
He said that they accept and respect the majority of independent candidates and invite them to make their own government by showing the majority, and if they don’t have the numbers then PML-N is the biggest party given that it has the support of other political parties that will form its government.
When asked about why his party was poaching PTI-backed candidates and engaging in horse trading, he said what is anyone, if independent candidates out of their free will join their party.
He had a long opening speech in the presser mostly against Imran Khan and his government. He termed Imran Khan a narcissist and fascist for not sitting with them even on the most important national issues.
Despite praising security agencies and ECP for holding free and fair elections, he did say that he heard stories that in K-P non-state actors wielding guns had taken over to ensure the victory of one party (PTI).
Shehbaz announced that they have a simple majority in Punjab while in the centre they have consolidated their number to 80.
He also dodged a question regarding a demand for a judicial commission to probe rigging to settle these allegations once and for all.
When asked if PML-N losing to PTI was a rejection of its narrative, he in a cryptic manner blamed rigging for it, saying that PML-N’s narrative lost its traction “when we were deprived of our seats in 2018”.
Shehbaz announced that Pakistan, will have to go for another IMF package almost immediately and that there was no escape from it.

4,Energy sector plans get IMF’s thumbs down,"Nathan Porter terms interim government’s proposals doubtful, risky","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday turned down Pakistan’s proposals to settle Rs1.3 trillion of energy sector circular debt and reduce electricity prices for industries, saying these proposals would overburden the residential consumers and also carry fiscal risks.
“The proposed (industrial tariff reduction) plan does not address the underlying problems and in particular, the circular debt neutrality of the tariff rationalization plan is doubtful,” IMF’s Mission Chief to Pakistan Nathan Porter said in a statement issued on Monday.
The IMF’s public disapproval of both the plans dampens the hopes of the interim government that was expecting to at least settle over one-fifth of the energy sector circular debt before leaving office.
The mission chief further added that the industrial tariff reduction plan “would place a significant additional burden on vulnerable households”.
The interim government had proposed to reduce the cross-subsidy burden of the industrial sector by 91% or Rs222 billion and in return it suggested to increase the subsidy burden of the residential consumers of over 400 units by 41% or Rs22 billion.
The government’s plan was also throwing an additional burden of Rs50 to Rs3,000 per month fixed charges in the electricity bills of all residential consumers.
The interim government’s proposal would have put an additional burden on the already overburdened residential consumers who are now facing extreme difficulties in paying their monthly bills.
“We will share our views on the IMF’s concerns and will continue our engagement on circular debt reduction and tariff rationalization to work towards finding common grounds to address both issues faced by the country’s power sector,” Energy Minister Mohammad Ali told The Express Tribune.
Porter said restoring the viability of the energy sector was critical to Pakistan's economic recovery and fiscal sustainability. However, it is essential for the government to focus on broad-based reforms, including reducing the high cost of energy, improving compliance and reducing theft and line losses.
He also emphasized focusing on ending gas to the captive power plants owned by the industrialists and fixing the governance and management of distribution companies (DISCOs), as well as keeping up with regular tariff adjustments to address the circular debt issue.

The consumers of up to 400 units of equal monthly consumption are receiving Rs592 billion subsidies at Rs13.65 per unit rate. Out of this Rs592 billion, the lifeline and protected consumers get Rs375 billion subsidies –a burden that the federal government should pick instead of passing on to other consumers.
The industrial consumer is paying Rs8.61 per unit subsidy and the residential consumer using more than 400 units is paying Rs5.88 per unit.
However, the government’s plan was about relieving industrialists from their Rs8.61 per unit burden but adding into the burden of Rs5.88 per unit of the industrial consumers.
Circular debt plan also rejected
The IMF has also not approved the government’s proposal to reduce the circular debt by 22% or Rs1.27 trillion by using Rs902 billion supplementary grants.
“The circular debt reduction plan entails fiscal risks given the chain of transactions involved and would also continue the use of supplementary grants which have placed a considerable burden on the fiscal accounts in recent years,” said the mission chief.
But Porter said the IMF was open to working with the government and other international partners to advance a sustainable reform plan addressing the issues mentioned above which, if successfully implemented, would allow tariffs for all classes of consumers to fall.
The circular debt stands at Rs5.72 trillion as of November last year.
The government had proposed to reduce Rs1 trillion gas sector debt and another Rs255 billion power sector debt through use of the Rs902 billion budget and the dividends of the gas exploration and production companies owned by the government.
The IMF was told that a grant of Rs745 billion was needed for only two days to trigger the entire process. The actual funds that would go back to the kitty in the shape of dividends and taxes would be Rs748 billion, they claimed in the plan submitted to the IMF.
Once implemented, the gas sector debt will come down from over Rs3 trillion to Rs2 trillion. The power sector circular debt will drop to Rs2.5 trillion.
Out of the Rs902 billion supplementary grant, the lion’s share of Rs556 billion, or 62%, was planned to be given to one firm – the Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL).
The market prices of the OGDCL and the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) kept swinging during the period the plan was under review of the Special Investment Facilitation Council and the IMF.
