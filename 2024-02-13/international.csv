2,Uncertainty looms over K-P’s budget,"In principle, the caretaker govt was expected to announce budget in late February","As the second four-month budget from November 2023 to February 2024, presented by the caretaker government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, approaches its term completion on February 29, the question of who will present the budget for the final four months (March to June) of the current financial year 2023-24 hangs in the balance. 
Sources said that no concrete decision has been reached on this matter thus far. The caretaker government, in its current term, revealed a budget of Rs529 billion for the period of November 2023 to February 2024, reflecting a deficit of Rs79 billion. 
The budget showcased an estimated income of Rs450.004 billion against an expenditure of Rs529.118 billion.
Allocations within the budget included Rs112.118 billion for development projects and Rs71 billion for the merged districts of the province. For the initial three months (July-September), the caretaker government had presented a budget of Rs462.930 billion.
Comparatively, this year's budget expanded to Rs992.055 billion, surpassing the previous fiscal year's eight-month budget of Rs888.00 billion. The breakdown reveals a budget of Rs350 billion for the first four months, followed by a second-quarter budget of Rs417.00 billion, culminating in a total development budget of Rs225.015 billion for eight months.
The second quarterly budget indicated a province income of Rs450 billion, while the earnings from July to October stood at Rs442.50 billion.
The caretaker government's financial approach maintained the tax and rate adjustments implemented during the PTI's Mahmood Khan government for the fiscal year 2022-23, reflecting consistency in its first and second four-month budgets.
Notable changes included the removal of property tax exemption for houses up to 5 marlas, with tax now applicable to 3 marla houses. In addition, the stamp value increased to Rs150 from Rs100.
The tax structure on various tobacco products was also revised: Rs12 per kg for Virginia tobacco, Rs6 per kg for white snuff, and Rs5 per kg for snuff tobacco.
While buildings owned by federal and provincial governments remained exempt from property tax, taxes on government buildings leased out for profit were retained based on annual rent. Moreover, religious places of worship such as mosques, churches, and gurdwaras continued to enjoy exemption from property tax.
However, as preparations for the budget for the next four months (March to June) are underway, uncertainties persist regarding which government—caretaker or newly elected—will present it. 
Sources said that in principle, the caretaker government is expected to announce the quarterly budget in late February, while the newly elected government would be responsible for the fiscal year 2024-25 budget, aligning with its manifesto and policy. 
However, a final decision on this matter is yet to be made. It is noteworthy that the finance department has already initiated the budgetary preparations for the next fiscal year 2024-25, guided by the instructions received from the elected government.

3,K-P Assembly members set to take oath on 29th,Highly unlikely provincial governor to convene meeting earlier,"After the general elections, the meeting of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly is constitutionally required to be convened by the 21st day, which is Feb 29. However, after the Election Commission has issued the gazette notification of the election results, the provincial governor can call the assembly session even before that.
Under Article 130(2) of the Constitution, the first meeting of the provincial assembly after the general election must be convened by the 21st day of the polls.
As the general elections were held on Feb 8, the constitutional deadline for convening the meeting of the provincial assembly is Feb 29.

In this regard, it has been clarified in Article 130(2) of the Constitution that after the publication of the gazette notification of the victory of the successful candidates by the Election Commission, the governor can call a meeting of the assembly even before the 21st day if he wishes.
However, due to the election procedure and other engagements on the part of various candidates, it is likely that the meeting of the K-P Assembly will be called on Feb 29 in which the successful members will take oath, after which Assembly Speaker Mushtaq Ghani will release the schedule for the election of the speaker and the assembly session will be adjourned.
After two days, the speaker will be elected in the assembly through a secret ballot. After that, the speaker will conduct an election for the post of deputy speaker. Once again the members will elect the deputy speaker through a secret ballot.

5,PTI protest leaves travellers stranded,Journey of a few minutes turns into an hours-long one,"Travellers in Peshawar witnessed a tumultuous scene as they found themselves caught in a gridlock due to a protest organised by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) against the alleged poll rigging. 
The protest demonstration, which entered its third consecutive day in opposition to the election results, disrupted normal life, particularly affecting the flow of traffic on GT Road and surrounding areas where continuous queues of vehicles blocked an entire network of intersecting streets. 
The situation aggravated as ambulances were also stuck in traffic, raising concerns about prompt access to emergency services.
According to reports, the congestion stretched to the nearby streets such as Dalazak Road as the drivers looked for alternative routes to avoid the protest venues.

Nonetheless, these diversions did not provide any respite to the annoyed travellers. The overwhelming number of demonstrators and cars stopped the traffic despite the presence of law enforcement officials trying to control the situation and allowing for easier traffic flow. 
While the authorities struggled to keep the peace and ensure that traffic flowed smoothly, the PTI activists persisted in their protest, demanding a review of the election results. 
The Peshawar residents appeared to be prepared for more disturbances as the demonstrators and law officers remained at odds.
