2,PM withdraws decision to grant honorarium,Three salaries reward to officers would have cost Rs30m,"The Prime Minister’s Office has decided to withdraw the decision of giving three salaries in reward to the officers serving at PM’s House and Office – in a move that would help save Rs30 million in addition to avoiding any public resentment.

But the low-paid employees serving against basic pay scales of 1 to 16 would still be entitled to the honorarium equal to their three monthly basic salaries, according to the government sources.

Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Monday partially reversed his earlier decision of giving three salaries in reward for all the employees serving in grade 1 to 22 at the Prime Minister’s Office and House.

Earlier, it had been decided that all the officials (grade 1 to 16) and the officers (grade 17-22) would be given a departing gift by the prime minister in the shape of three salaries in rewards. When contacted, a senior functionary of the PM’s Office stated that it has now been decided that the rewards would not be given to the officers serving in grade 17 to 22.

However, all the employees serving in grade 1 to 16 would still be entitled to the honorarium. The low-paid employees are more vulnerable to the inflationary pressures and they do hope that every premier would honour their services at the time of departure by giving them monetary benefits, the senior functionary said.

There is a possibility that in the next few days, at least two of the three biggest largest political parties would form an alliance and make a government, which would end the term of Anwaarul Haq Kakar that began in August last year.

The senior functionary said that it was not unusual that every prime minister would give such benefits at the end of the term of the office. But he said that it has now been decided that the officers would be exempted from the honorarium.

The decision would help save Rs30 million of the exchequer – a sum not substantial in itself but carries significant symbolic value. The cost of giving honorariums is over Rs50.6 million, according to the officials.

The premier’s fresh decision reflects the ground realities, suggesting a sensitivity to public sentiment on the matter.

Earlier, on a proposal from his staff, the caretaker prime minister had approved giving three months’ basic salary as honorarium for “completion of the official tasks in the current financial year in a befitting manner”.

After the PM’s decision, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had also approved a supplementary grant by creating a room in the budget.

If the ECC's approved decision had been executed as planned, it would have incurred a cost of Rs80.63 million to the exchequer. At the time of the approval, the Ministry of Finance had expressed reservations about giving the honoraria. However, the majority of ECC members insisted that the cabinet body should recognise the prime minister’s authority.

The ECC had approved Rs42 million for rewards for the public wing of the PM’s Office and Rs38.63 million for the PM’s House.

Pakistan faces a precarious fiscal situation, making it imperative to refrain from such rewards, especially to public servants who receive substantial salaries and can withstand challenges of high inflationary pressures.
Inflation has persisted in double digits for an extended duration, reaching over 28% in January.

The federal government’s budget deficit widened more than 50% during the first half of this fiscal year, requiring a prudent fiscal management and leaving no room for any kind of rewards.

Compared to the private sector, the low-paid employees are getting higher salaries and enjoying job security.

In the first half, the federal government’s total expenditures surged by 58% compared to the same period of the previous year. The total expenses amounted to Rs6.7 trillion – higher by Rs2.5 trillion. There was also a 50% increase in the current expenditures that amounted to Rs6.6 trillion in six months.

3,SC’s role in spotlight,Lawyers lament both superior bars safeguarding the interests of powerful circles," 
The recently concluded general elections have once again brought the role of the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, into the spotlight, mirroring the controversies of the 2018 elections.

Despite expressing its grievances with other state institutions on various occasions, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was unable to catch a break from the CJP under whom the top court could not grant relief to the embattled former ruling party.

Although the court played its part in ensuring elections on February 8 on the demands of parties, including the PTI, lingering doubts emerged about the credibility of the entire electoral performance.

The situation has cast the country back to a scenario witnessed in 2018 when the leadership of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) found itself behind bars just two weeks before the polls.

The role of former CJP Mian Saqib Nisar in those elections was also met with scepticism.

During that time, a three-judge bench led by ex-CJP Saqib Nisar had declared Imran Khan as ""Sadiq and Ameen"" (truthful and trustworthy). However, simultaneously, the SC ensured the conviction of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz before the elections.

In the lead-up to the 2024 general elections, a larger bench, presided over by CJP Isa, revisited its earlier decision on the disqualification of lawmakers under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution. The ruling notably benefited PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and Jahangir Khan Tareen.

However, a different bench led by Chief Justice Isa deemed the intra-party elections of PTI illegal, leading to the party's loss of its election symbol just before the polls. The credibility of the elections came into question following the order on January 13

'Symbol case crumbles'

According to former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar, the PTI election symbol case crumbled on Feb 8 thanks to the people’s verdict.

""It was an act of judicial raw power reminiscent of Muhammad Munir, Sheikh Anwaarul Haq and Irshad Hassan Khan. In the words of U.S Justice Antonin Scalia it constitutes “… an affront to the principle of democratic rule… robs the People of the most important liberty: the freedom to govern themselves,” he noted.

He pointed out that consequences include marred elections, an assault on democracy, constitutional ambivalence, a deeply fractured nation and loss of public legitimacy in constitutional institutions.
“There cannot be many who fail to grasp the cause and effects,"" Tariq Khokhar added.

Shahbaz Khosa, the Additional Secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), also voiced dissatisfaction with the SC’s involvement in the recent general elections, highlighting the deprivation of the PTI from its election symbol.

He also criticised the conduct of the SCBA over the past couple of years, asserting that both superior bars are safeguarding the interests of powerful circles.

Legal experts argue that the SC now possesses a golden opportunity to rectify its previous mistake by safeguarding the mandate of a political party.

The focus of the discussion has shifted to whether the judiciary will offer relief to the PTI in election disputes, although election issues can only be contested in the election tribunals as per Article 225 of the Constitution.

Several candidates supported by PTI have lodged appeals with the higher courts contesting the election outcomes declared by Returning Officers (ROs).

It is pertinent to note that the strained relationship between PTI and the apex court intensified after the court deemed intra-party elections as illegal.

PTI also withdrew a contempt petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other entities, citing a lack of confidence in obtaining relief during the elections.

An important aspect revolves around the allocation of reserved seats to PTI. The majority of lawyers believe that PTI should be granted reserved seats, and questions arise about whether PTI-backed independent candidates can form a parliamentary party.

A PTI lawyer disclosed that various options are under consideration to secure reserved seats. The decision on whether PTI will approach the SC to obtain reserved seats and bind their independent candidates from defection is still pending.

With the invalidation of intra-party elections, the question arises: who will assume the role of the party head and provide guidance on the applicability of Article 63-A of the constitution?

A senior government official emphasised the need for clarity on the interpretation of Article 63-A to deter the defection of independent candidates who were backed by the PTI.

Article 63 A (2) of the Constitution says that a member of a house shall be deemed to be a member of a parliamentary party if he has been elected as a candidate or nominee of a political party which constitutes the parliamentary party in the house or, having been elected otherwise than as a candidate or nominee of a political party has become a member of such parliamentary party after such election by means of a declaration in writing.

In view of this provision, there is a need to get clarification about the party 'nominee' and candidate'.
Lawyers believe that awarding three convictions to Imran Khan sent the wrong message to the public.
Despite these hurdles, the public voted for PTI-backed candidates.

A political leader not affiliated with PTI suggested that female voters were displeased with the Iddat case decision and mostly voted for PTI-backed candidates.

This situation also poses a test for the Supreme Court, examining how it will restore public faith in the judicial system.

4,"FIA uncovers fake passport, ID scam","Arrests 16, including passport and NADRA officers","The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has uncovered an international racket allegedly involved in issuing Pakistani identity cards and passports to Afghan nationals.

As part of its crackdown, the agency has apprehended 16 individuals, including officials from the immigration and passport department, as well as the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA).

According to the FIA spokesperson, those detained include three assistant directors from the Passport and Immigration Directorate, which operates under the Ministry of Interior, four NADRA officers, four agents, and five Afghan citizens.

The FIA initiated action based on a complaint from the Passport and Immigration Directorate.
An investigation is currently underway, with additional raids being conducted to apprehend other officials and agents implicated in issuing Pakistani identity cards and passports to Afghan residents, the spokesperson added.

Last year, Pakistan launched a massive crackdown on Afghan nationals residing in the country without proper documents, amid strong protests from the Afghan government. As a result of the campaign, thousands of Afghan citizens were compelled to leave the country.

On December 28, 2023, the FIA’s Anti-Corruption Circle Islamabad apprehended a four-member gang of former NADRA employees involved in fraudulent activities related to issuance of identification cards to Afghans and foreigners by illicitly adding them to Pakistani family trees.

The illegal activities had taken place at the NADRA Mega Centre at Islamabad Blue Area, where the accused provided identity cards to foreign nationals during the years 2019 and 2020.

The suspects were alleged to have illegally collected biometric data of laborers participating in the Ehsaas programme and registered Afghan individuals in their family trees.

5,PML-N’s hand ‘stronger to stitch together govt’,PML-N burning the midnight oil to form govt at Centre without splitting the baby,"As the political chessboard sees its pieces shifting and alliances forming in the aftermath of the Feb 8 vote, the PML-N’s hand appeared stronger on Monday to pull off the task of stitching together a federal government – without splitting the baby as it holds extensive consultations with allies on nitty-gritty.
Following the post-Feb 8 vote whirlwind, where no party emerged as a simple majority, the PML-N and PPP have been engaged in a strategic tango to form a central government with the support of their allies.
The PML-N, in particular, is burning the midnight oil to piece together a government in the Centre, Punjab, and Balochistan.
Meanwhile, as political wheeling and dealing also reached a fever pitch, seven freshly elected members of the Punjab Assembly joined PML-N, meeting with the party's chief organizer, Maryam Nawaz.
Sohail Khan from PP-240 Bahawalnagar, Khurram Virk from PP-48 Sialkot, and Shehzada Gazin Abbasi from PP-249 Ahmed Pur Sharqia were among the MPAs making the strategic move.
Joining the ranks were Khizar Mazarr from Rajanpur, Zulfiqar Ali Shah, Saqib Chadhar from Chiniot, and Rana Fayyas from Pasroor.
During the meeting, Maryam hailed the decision of the independent candidates, saying it was a game-changer in providing facilities to the common people. Meanwhile, the independents expressed complete confidence in the prowess of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.
Simultaneously, behind closed doors at the residence of PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, political activities buzzed with intensity.
Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) president Abdul Aleem Khan and newly elected National Assembly member Awn Chaudhry arrived at the former prime minister’s residence, according to party sources.
The two leaders delved into a detailed discussion on the current political landscape and government formation.
'PM after consultations'
Meanwhile, in a press conference at the party secretariat in Model Town, PML-N's Deputy Secretary General Attaullah Tarar hinted at the party's strength to pull off the task of creating a federal government.
However, he said that the selection of their prime ministerial candidate would be announced only after reaching a thorough consensus with political allies.
Tarar revealed discussions with the PPP and MQM-P were underway for the Centre, coupled with efforts to rope in newly elected members into the party.
Tarar expressed confidence in the PML-N's ability to establish a government in Punjab as the party attained a simple majority in the province.
The PML-N leader underlined the importance of proper consensus among all political allies before announcing the candidate for the premiership. Tarar extended congratulations to all PML-N workers, elected members, and leaders for the anticipated government formation in Punjab.
Regarding the election results, Tarar said there were certain elements that had prematurely celebrated success based on the initial 25 per cent result announcement. However, he pointed out that when final results were announced, these elements began alleging electoral malpractice and raised concerns about rigging.
Tarar admitted that prominent PML-N figures, including Rana Sanaullah, Mian Javed Latif, Sheikh Rohail Asghar, and Khawaja Saad Rafique, had lost their seats. He argued that if there had been rigging by the PML-N, these seats could not have been lost.
Despite the losses, he said the party had gracefully accepted electoral results in areas where they faced defeat.
Meanwhile, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb dismissed premature claims about the party's PM candidate, asserting that senior leader Khawaja Muhammad Asif's statement was being taken out of context.
maintained that the final decision would only be made after due consultation with political allies, promising transparency in the process.
The PML-N, despite notable losses in seats held by prominent figures like Rana Sanaullah and Mian Javed Latif, remains undeterred, gracefully accepting defeat in areas where electoral results did not favour them.
It is pertinent to note that the PML-N and PPP, with 75 and 54 seats respectively, are engaged in constructive discussions.
A recent meeting between Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari at Bilawal House in Lahore, though shrouded in mystery, is seen as a pivotal moment in shaping the political landscape.
With the PTI-backed independent candidates leading with at least 93 seats in the National Assembly polls, the political arena is alive with speculations. The PML-N, however, continues to navigate the complex terrain with a mix of confidence and careful strategy.

6,SC to review judges accountability verdict,Asks AGP to suggest names of legal experts to assist the court," 
The Supreme Court has accepted an intra-court appeal (ICA) filed by the federal government against an apex court order that stated that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) could not conduct misconduct proceedings against retired judges of superior courts.
A five-member larger bench, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard the ICA. The court decided to appoint amici curiae in the case and asked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan to suggest names.
Civil society activist Afiya Shehrbano Zai had filed a complaint against former chief justice of Pakistan (CJ) Mian Saqib Nisar under Article 209 of the Constitution, dealing with misconduct by superior court judges, over an alleged breach of the judges’ code of conduct.
However, a division bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, set aside the complaint on June 27, 2023, declaring that judges who retire or resign do not fall within the ambit of Article 209.
Last month, on January 23, the federal government filed an appeal against the SC ruling. In its appeal, the government requested the court to set aside the verdict in the Afiya Shehrbano Zia case.
This development occurred against the backdrop of the resignation of Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, who relinquished his post on January 10 as the SJC was about to conclude its misconduct proceedings against him.
A day after his resignation, another senior SC judge, Ijazul Ahsan, resigned reportedly ahead of the filing of a similar reference against him.
The appeal argued that the SC’s June 27 verdict failed to distinguish the consequences upon resignation of a judge under Article 206, retirement under Article 179, and removal under Article 209.
“The judgment has rendered the functionality of the SJC redundant by making Article 209 inapplicable to a judge who has retired or resigned while inquiry proceedings were pending against him and/or a show-cause notice has been issued to him,” it said.
During Monday's hearing, the AGP noted that according to the Afiya Shehrbano case verdict, the Supreme Court can neither issue directives to the SJC nor regulate it.
Read: CJ says judges are undeterred by criticism
“The federal government agrees with this part of the verdict that the Supreme Court cannot give directives to the SJC. However, an ongoing SJC inquiry cannot be concluded solely on the basis that the judge has retired or resigned.
“This is not just an issue of judges' pensions but rather a matter of public trust, transparency, and accountability in the judiciary,” he said.
Justice Irfan Saadat Khan observed that there were some judges who might be directly affected by this appeal. ""Whether they should be issued notices or not,"" he questioned. “Shouldn’t these judges be given the right to defense?”
Justice Mussarat Hilali asked whether this recent case is regarding the two SC judges who recently resigned or is it about the future.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail stated that the present case is not about any specific judge but relates to a principle. “If the SJC proves misconduct against a judge, what will be the legal consequences? Judges are not above the law, but they have certain constitutional protections.”
Justice Mandokhail noted that complaints full of baseless allegations are filed against judges. These complaints are followed by a social media campaign in which the same allegations are repeated, he said.
Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi remarked that when some honest judges deliver judgments, blackmailers file complaints against them. He asked what actions bar councils take against the lawyers who file such complaints. The court later adjourned till February 19.

In the notice submitted to the Senate, Senator Murtaza posed the following concerns: 1) How were the elections conducted in the country by the Election Commission (ECP), the caretaker government, and other institutions? 2) Did the election results align with the public's expectations? 3) How many political parties accepted the election results? 4) What situation has unfolded in the country following the release of the poll results?

Senator Murtaza emphasised the need for a comprehensive debate in the upper house to pre-empt any potential political or economic crisis in the coming days. He expressed optimism that such discussions would pave the way for finding viable solutions to the challenges at hand.

8,Protests against ‘rigging’ continue,Balochistan hit hardest; Sindh witnesses demonstrations,"Widespread protests in Balochistan, Sindh, and other parts of the country against the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections held on Feb 8 entered their fourth consecutive day on Monday.

Political parties, including the National Party, PPP, JUI, BAP, BNP-Mengal, PkMAP, and PkNAP, staged protest demonstrations engulfing major thoroughfares and district returning offices, demanding recounts and challenging the declared outcomes.

Balochistan appeared to be cut off from the rest of the country as candidates who did not make their way to the provincial assembly continued to block highways.

""Our protest will continue until justice is served,"" Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shahi, the central leader of the NP, said while addressing a demonstration outside the deputy commissioner's office in Quetta on Monday.

Four political parties, including the BNP-M, PkMAP, and the Hazara Democratic Party (HDP), announced joint protest demonstrations against the alleged election rigging in the province.

""We are determined to get our voters' rights,"" Haji Atta Muhammad Bangulzai, another leader of the NP, said. He claimed his victory was turned into defeat by the returning officer.

The protesters have blocked the main Anscomb Road Chowk in Quetta's high security zone suspending traffic in the city.

They also established a joint protest camp to mount pressure on the Election Commission of Pakistan to reconsider its results about their constituencies.

""The ROs snatched our democratic right,"" Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, the central leader of PkMAP, said.
He said the ROs and the ECP were responsible for what he called “record rigging in the province”.

Various political parties, including the Awami National Party, JUI and some candidates blocked main highways linking Balochistan with Karachi, Sindh, Punjab and other parts of the country.

Common people were the worst affected by the blockade of highways in Balochistan.

""We are at the mercy of protesters for the last two days,"" Abdul Shakoor, one of the passengers stranded in Kalat, told The Express Tribune via telephone.

Shakoor said that women, children, senior citizens and patients were suffering because of the blockade.

The PTI also levelled serious allegations, claiming that it was deprived of three National Assembly and nine provincial assembly seats.

The political parties have also announced a joint shutter-down strike on Tuesday across Balochistan in this regard.

In Sindh, the political parties also protested against the alleged rigging. The PTI staged a demonstration outside the ECP headquarters, the JUI blocked road links in the province, and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) staged sit-ins in various parts of Karachi.

The JUI leaders and workers barricaded the highway that connects Sindh and Balochistan, claiming that the results of the polls on Feb 8 were rigged to benefit the PPP. They warned that the protests would continue if a fair vote recount was not conducted.

The JI organised sit-ins at eight significant junctions in Karachi, calling on the ECP to renounce the “fake results” of the general elections.

Meanwhile, in Islamabad, the capital police has asserted that Section 144 is in force in the city and that legal action will be taken against any illegal assembly of people. ""Some people are inciting illegal gatherings around the election commission office and other government institutions. It should be noted that incitement to gather is also a crime,"" it said on social media platform X.(With input from News Desk)

9,"Shehbaz should be PM, ‘else dark horse will emerge’",Vawda claims bidding of independents currently under way," 
Former senator Faisal Vawda has said that if Nawaz Sharif becomes the prime minister and PPP does not become a part of the alliance, the firecracker will go off in six months – suggesting that the government will not last for even six months against the constitutional mandate of five years.

In a conversation with a private TV channel, the politician credited PPP Co-chairman Asif Zardari for the party’s “win-win position”. “A coalition government will be formed and the PPP will take over everything,” he claimed

Vawda said that he had already said that it was an issue of horoscopes.

“If the father [Nawaz] becomes the prime minister, the daughter [Maryam Nawaz] will not become the chief minister. If the daughter will be the chief minister, the father will not be the prime minister.”

After that, Vawda said, there are “more chances that Shehbaz Sharif should be the prime minister, otherwise a dark horse [an unexpected winner] will emerge”.

In response to a question regarding independent members of the National Assembly supported by the PTI, he said that under the judicial selection 2024, a reference to the general elections, if “you catch 93, then 30 are those who are not in their favour”.

“They are always independent, they come and wherever the government is formed, they go there.”
