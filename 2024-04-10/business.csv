The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) achieved a remarkable milestone during the outgoing holy month, as it usually sees low volume and lacklustre activities in Ramazan. However, this year, the month proved to be different due to political stability post-election and other developments, tossing the market to new peaks in the last session before Eid holidays.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the equity market settled at a record amid upbeat remittances data rising year-on-year by 16.4pc to $2.95bn in March and affirmation of a $5bn investment package from Saudi Arabia for economic support.
Last year, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $25 billion within the next five years under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which is seeking investments in the energy, IT, minerals, defence and agriculture sectors from the Arab countries.
The $5bn investment is expected to be made in the minerals sector, especially the Reko Diq gold and copper mines. Saudi Arabia has already been studying the prospects of tapping into this sector, though the kingdom also has interests in petroleum, agriculture, and IT sectors.
Mr Mehanti said the rising global crude oil prices and renewed hopes for support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to settle Pakistan’s external financing needs of over $25bn in the next fiscal year also fuelled the bullish sentiments.
He said speculations ahead of new IMF loan programme talks due next week and expectations of a cut in the SBP policy rate amid falling inflation triggered value-hunting across the board.
Topline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Officer Muhammad Suhail said the benchmark KSE 100 index has surged by an astounding 70pc over the past nine months (equivalent to a 75pc increase in US dollar terms) from end June, marking a historic rally not witnessed in the PSX for the past two decades. 
Despite this rally, the average market price to earnings (PE) ratio is 4x, half the historical average of 8x, he added.
Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank Ltd, Hub Power Company Ltd, Mari Petroleum Ltd and Engro Fertilisers contributed 471 points to the index. 
As a result, the benchmark KSE 100-share index surged to an intraday record of 70,677.30, gaining 1,057.31 points. However, it closed at 70,314.72 points after adding 694.73 points, or 1pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume rose 15.95pc to 389.39 million shares. The traded value also increased by 12.78pc to Rs17.31bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (34.37m shares), Pakistan International Bulk Terminal (27.81m shares), Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (19.03m shares), Fauji Foods Ltd (13.01m shares) and Agritech Ltd (12.73m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs100.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs55.85), Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs24.00), Abbott Laboratories Ltd (Rs21.67) and Millat Tractors Ltd (Rs14.75).
The shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd (Rs60.00), Bata Pakistan (Rs50.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs30.31), Pakistan Hotels Developers Ltd (Rs15.53) and Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs11.67).
Foreign investors remained net buyers as they bought shares worth $2.47m.

1,Rupee holds steady ahead of holidays,Some analysts still fear any shock can destabilise exchange rate within days.,"KARACHI: In the lead-up to the Eid holiday break, the rupee displayed resilience, staying steady against the US dollar in Tuesday’s interbank trading.
According to the State Bank, the dollar closed at Rs277.94 on Tuesday compared to Rs277.95 the previous day.
Over the past three months, the rupee has appreciated by around Rs3 against the dollar, signalling a period of stability and incremental growth in the local currency’s performance.
While this exchange rate stability did not directly spur foreign direct investment, March witnessed a significant uptick in domestic bond inflows.
The SBP’s data reveals an inflow of $89 million into treasury bills during March, the highest monthly inflow during the current fiscal year. The figure also outpaced equity inflows, which stood at $26.4m, even as the stock market experienced notable volumes.

Some analysts still fear any shock can destabilise exchange rate within days 

Currency experts say the current boom in the equity market is mainly due to stability in the exchange rate, but the treasury bills proved more attractive for foreign investors.
The gradual appreciation of the rupee against the dollar supported the exchange rate, but exporters were perturbed by this situation. Some bankers say the rupee may appreciate more rapidly if the local currency sets it free, but the government and the State Bank are trying to manage the exchange rate in favour of exporters.
Exporters express concern over the potential for decreased earnings due to the dollar’s devaluation, with forward booking premiums dropping significantly.
The State Bank’s latest report shows its foreign exchange reserves at slightly above $8bn, which is insufficient to keep the exchange rate stable amid continuous debt servicing payments.
The outflows for debt servicing eat up over 85 per cent of the remittances coming into the country. The remittances are higher than export proceeds and play a key role in curbing the current account deficit.
Facing increasing debt repayment obligations, which are undermining the nation’s financial stability, Pakistan requires an ambitious $25 billion for the next fiscal year (2024-25) to manage its external account effectively. This necessitates a strategy focused on equating exports with imports to mitigate the trade deficit.
However, the current government approach largely mirrors past tactics, relying on seeking new loans from the IMF, soliciting additional support, aid and grants from friendly nations, and negotiating loan rollovers with key partners like Saudi Arabia, UAE and China.
“There is no hope for a strong future of the local currency. Any shock could destabilise the exchange rate within days,” a currency dealer said.

2,Pakistan’s exports to central Asian states jump 21pc in 8 months,"Despite existing prospects, bilateral trade volume yet to attain full potential.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports to five central Asian countries (CACs) witnessed a growth of 21.17 per cent during the first eight months of the current fiscal year over the corresponding period last year.
Despite the existing prospects, the country’s exports to the region have yet to attain their full potential. Similarly, imports from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and other countries to Pakistan have not increased significantly, despite regular high-profile visits.
In absolute terms, the value of Pakistan’s exports to the five central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — rose by 21.17pc to $158.07 million in July-February 2024 from $130.45m during the same period last year.
Imports from the region fell by 18.56pc to $17.46m in 8MFY24 from $21.44m during the same period last year. The majority of these imports came from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.

Despite existing prospects, bilateral trade volume yet to attain full potential

Pakistan’s trade with CACs is between $400 and $500m annually via transit of Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has already implemented its transit trade agreement with Pakistan, under which 1,200 containers were imported in February.
Tajikistan imported three trucks loaded with potatoes from Pakistan under the transit agreement.
Pakistan’s exports to Turkmenistan stood at $0.735m in 8MFY24 from $0.79m over the corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 6.33pc. Imports from Turkmenistan recorded a growth of 113pc to $4.96m during the period under review against $2.32m over the corresponding months last year.
The export proceeds to Uzbekistan reached $47.07m in 8MFY24 against $53.22m over the corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 11.55pc. Imports from Uzbekistan also declined by 19.87pc to $9.11m from $11.37m over the corresponding months last year.
In terms of value, Kazakhstan has the highest export value, with $90.76m in 8MFY24 compared to $59.55m during the same period last year, representing a 52.40pc rise. The value of imports from Kazakhstan fell 85.74pc to $0.62m this year against $4.35m over the corresponding months of last year.
Pakistan’s exports to Kyrgyzstan stood at $6.37m in 8MFY24 against $2.78m over the corresponding months last year, indicating an increase of 129pc. Imports from Kyrgyzstan stood at $0.27m this year as against $0.14m over the last year, a decline of over 92pc.
Exports to Tajikistan stood at $13.14m in 8MFY24 against $14.11m over corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 6.87pc. Similarly, imports from Tajikistan also dropped 23.3pc to $2.50 against $3.26m over the corresponding months last year.
Pakistan and Tajikistan have already signed and implemented a transit trade agreement. Under the agreement, Tajikistan will import goods via Pakistani seaports.

3,International Finance Corporation approves $400m for PTCL to buy Telenor,Financing agreements with IFC will be completed by July 31.,"ISLAMABAD: The International Finance Corporation (IFC) board has approved $400 million in financing for PTCL Group’s purchase of Telenor Pakistan.
The decision follows Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd’s (PTCL) signing of a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Telenor Pakistan to acquire a 100 per cent stake in the company on a cash-free, debt-free basis.
As the takeover of Telenor Pakistan by the PTCL is in progress, the financing agreements with IFC will be completed by July 31.
While the UAE-owned company e&, formerly Etisalat, had management control of the PTCL, sources in the PTCL revealed that the IFC would provide the financing to the Government of Pakistan, which is still the largest shareholder of the PTCL.
PTCL’s management is with ‘e&’, which has 26pc of the shares. The largest shareholding of 62pc is with the Government of Pakistan and the remaining 12pc has been floated through the PSX.
However, the financing details will be made public when the loan will be materialised in July.
Since PTCL was a listed company, the IFC decision was also informed to the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited (PSX) under the rules.
The PTCL has informed the PSX that in December 2023, after approval by the PTCL board of directors, the company entered into an SPA with the shareholders of Telenor Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd for the acquisition of its 100pc shares in Pakistan at Rs108bn on a cash-free and debt-free basis.
PTCL had approached the IFC for financing to materialise the deal.
The acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by PTCL Group is subject to necessary regulatory approvals, including the formal clearance by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).
Currently, there are four players in the telecom sector led by Jazz, Telenor, Zong and Ufone, while Ufone is a subsidiary of the PTCL; after the intended acquisition of Telenor Pakistan, both Ufone and Telenor will be merged to become equally as large as Jazz.
The competitors have raised concerns to the CCP over the acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by the PTCL.
The acquisition of Telenor by the PTCL will be one of the largest mergers in Pakistan’s telecom sector, as the joint company of Ufoneand Telenor Pakistan will bring their subscriber base close to that of Jazz, the largest telecom in the country.

4,Oil prices ease amid deadlock in Gaza truce talks,Brent crude futures fell 91 cents to $89.7 per barrel by 12:50pm ET; US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.12 at $85.29.,"HOUSTON: Oil prices dipped for a second day on Tuesday, as talks for a ceasefire in Gaza continued, but losses were limited to less than a dollar a barrel as Egyptian and Qatari mediators met resistance in their search to find a way out of the war.
The talks in Cairo, also attended by the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency William Burns, have so far failed to reach a breakthrough.
Hamas said an Israeli proposal on a ceasefire met none of the demands of Palestinian militant factions, but it would study the offer further and deliver its response to mediators.
Brent crude futures fell 91 cents, or 1 per cent, to $89.7 per barrel by 12:50pm ET (1650 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down $1.12 cents or 1.3% at $85.29.
On Monday, Brent posted its first decline in five sessions and WTI its first in seven as a fresh round of Israel-Hamas ceasefire discussions in Cairo raised hopes of a breakthrough.
“Without an end to the conflict, there is an elevated risk that other countries, particularly Iran, Opec’s third-largest producer, could be drawn into the war,” said Fiona Cincotta, Senior Financial Market Analyst at City Index.
The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard’s navy said it could close the Strait of Hormuz if deemed necessary. About a fifth of the volume of the world’s total oil consumption passes through the strait daily.
Turkiye announced it would restrict exports of various products, inclu­ding jet fuel, to Israel until there is a ceasefire. Israel said it would respond with its own curbs.

6,OICCI seeks steps for ease of doing business,OICCI members contribute about one-third of the country’s tax revenue and are also the largest investors in Pakistan.,"LAHORE: Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has emphasised the need for significant progress towards Ease of Doing Business measures, especially in taxation and regulatory compliance.
“There is also a need to critically examine the need for a large number of regulatory bodies, in line with other similar economies as Pakistan appears to be an over-regulated economy, which discourages initiative and investment by local and foreign investors,” the chamber said on Tuesday in a letter to Federal Minister for Ministry of Privatisation and Board of Investment and Communication Abdul Aleem Khan.
OICCI is the collective body of Pakistan’s top 200 foreign investors from 30 countries, said the letter. 
OICCI members contribute about one-third of the country’s tax revenue and are also the largest investors in Pakistan. In the last ten years, they have invested about $22 billion to expand their footprint in the country and transfer technical and managerial best practices.
“We offer valuable global insights to benefit Pakistan’s investment ecosystem. Once finalised, the results of the OICCI and McKinsey reports for a few selected sectors will be duly shared with the government of Pakistan,” it said.

7,SBP develops payment framework for BISP beneficiaries,"About 9.3 million BISP beneficiaries can open a ""BISP Sahulat Account"" in a single visit to designated bank branch.","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has developed a framework to onboard the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) beneficiaries for receiving social welfare payments into their accounts to be opened in all banks and microfinance banks.
The SBP said the framework has been developed in consultation with the BISP and banks.
Under the framework, about 9.3 million BISP beneficiaries can open a “BISP Sahulat Account” in a single visit to the designated bank branch within their vicinity. The BISP has mapped its beneficiaries with a bank branch near them.
However, given the large number of beneficiaries, the framework will be implemented in phases. Initially, a pilot phase will be run in Karachi and Lahore to, onboarding about 300,000 BISP beneficiaries. After the pilot phase is successful, the framework coverage will be extended to other cities in consultation with BISP, said the SBP.
The SBP said, “The framework is expected to facilitate the efficient and transparent disbursement of social welfare payments to BISP beneficiaries, enhance women’s financial inclusion, and promote the digitisation of financial services.”
The BISP was widely criticised for gross misuse of funds, but the government finds it helpful for people who are unable to pay their day-to-day expenses. The latest move is apparently to plug the leakages and pilferages of the funds.
To enable the BISP’s beneficiaries to receive their financial assistance directly into their bank accounts, the SBP has asked banks and microfinance banks to open accounts for the beneficiaries as per the arrangement made for this purpose. The framework will initially be adopted as a pilot for onboarding BISP beneficiaries in Karachi and Lahore. After the successful implementation of the pilot phase, the scope of the framework, with adjustments if needed, will be extended to other cities. The BISP will disburse the funds into these accounts through RAAST/IBFT.
The banks will arrange employee training programmes to facilitate BISP beneficiaries during the account/ ATM PIN activation and subsequent disbursement process. The banks will recover all upfront and ongoing costs associated with account opening, issuance and maintenance of ATM cards from the BISP, and no such charges will be levied on the BISP beneficiaries.
However, the fee for issuance of a replacement or duplicate debit or ATM Card before its expiry will be recovered from the BISP beneficiary.
The banks will not issue chequebooks to the BISP account holder or activate internet/mobile banking facilities.
