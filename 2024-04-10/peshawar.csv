He said the business community could make contact with the chamber to take advantage of these research study reports.
The SCCI president unveiled the report prepared by the chamber’s research and development cell regarding natural resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and potential in agriculture and fishery sectors during an Iftar-dinner hosted in honour of executive members of SCCI here.
The Iftar-dinner was attended by SCCI’s senior vice-presidents Sanaullah, Ejaz Afridi, former presidents Hasnain Khurshid, Riaz Arshad, Zahid Shinwari, Adeel Rauf, Faiz Mohammad, Sherbaz Bilour, former vice-presidents and SCCI executive members.
Fuad Ishaq said that SCCI planned to organise a business conference with the theme – traders and industrialists are builders of the nation – in the second week of May.
He said that political leaders, government officials from relevant institutions and representatives of stakeholders would be invited to the conference.
Mr Ishaq said that a joint economic roadmap would be designed during this important moot. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is blessed with abundant natural resources like oil, gas and hydel electricity. However, despite that the province is lagging behind as compared to the other federating units in the journey of progress,” Mr Ishaq deplored.
The SCCI president said that traders and industrialists were in trouble in the prevailing circumstances, while jobs were not available to the talented and highly-qualified youth. He said economic growth and prosperity would only come with flourishing business, industry and trade.
The chamber president urged the relevant authorities to take pragmatic steps to mitigate hardships of the business community because when traders and industrialists would be prosperous then business and trade could be enhanced, leading to generation of employment opportunities in the province.

“Air ambulance service should be launched to make sure that people in remote and inaccessible areas reach hospitals on time,” he told a meeting here.
The meeting was also attended by health minister Syed Qasim Ali Shah, health secretary Mahmood Aslam Wazir and Sehat Card Plus CEO Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli, according to an official statement.

He also says matters about Sehat Card Plus programme should be made more transparent

The chief minister said that the provincial government would provide the required funds for the initiative as it was the need of the time to provide prompt healthcare to the people in the event of emergencies to protect their lives.
He also ordered the launch of a motorcycle response unit to help transport patients to hospitals in emergencies from congested areas.
Mr Gandapur said the Executive Health Checkup programme should be launched in hospitals to enable people over 65 years of age to undergo free checkups every three months.
Officials told the CM that 52,542 patients received Rs1.314 billion free treatment under the SCP programme since March 12.
They also said that artificial intelligence was being used to make services under the SCP more transparent and use taxpayers’ money to benefit the people.
The officials said that a mobile app was being prepared through which the names of family heads and other members would be available to all people.
They said the government was making full use of modern technology to make the initiative more transparent and people-friendly.
The officials said a “system of open kutcheris” had been launched to let people ask questions about the SCP programme and lodge complaints.
They added that during those events, most of the complaints were resolved on the spot.
The officials said there was also another mechanism of feedback through Nadra’s system, where 98.5 per cent of the people were found to be satisfied with the health insurance programme.
On the occasion, CEO of the SCP Dr Riaz Tanoli said the health insurance programme benefitted all residents of the province.
He said all people with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s computerised national identity cards could seek treatment not only in the province’s hospitals but in those in other provinces as well.
“There is a laid down criteria for the selection of hospitals, where the people can seek quality services on the production of the Sehat Cards,” he said.
Dr Tanoli said no compromise was made on the quality of services.
He said more hospitals with modern infrastructure and staff would be empanelled for the programme.
“We have suspended empanellment of many hospitals after finding complaints against them true,” he said.

4,PHC seeks KP Assembly speaker’s reply over plea of members elected on reserved seats,Court clubs instant plea with three other petitions over oath issue.,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Tuesday sought reply within a fortnight from speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly to plea of some opposition members elected on seats reserved for women and non-Muslims seeking implementation of the court’s order directing him (speaker) to take oath from them.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Fazal Subhan issued the order after preliminary hearing of a petition jointly filed by eight of the MPAs notified by Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on reserved seats including Ms Mehr Sultana, Behari Lal, Suresh Kumar, etc.
The bench also directed to club the instant plea with three other petitions filed by some other opposition members on reserved seats including Shazia Tehmas Khan, Aiman Jalil Jan, etc.
The petitioners have stated that despite clear directives of the court to the speaker to take oath from them prior to the April 2 Senate polls, he did not administer oath to them.

Court clubs instant plea with three other petitions over oath issue

They have requested the court to issue order to the KP Assembly speaker for implementation of its order.
Barrister Saqib Raza appeared for the petitioners and stated that the petitioners and several other MPAs, who were notified as MPAs on reserved seats, had filed petitions seeking declaration of the court that the non-administration of oath to them was illegal and unconstitutional.
He stated that the petitioners had further requested the court to direct the respondents including the speaker and the deputy speaker of the assembly to administer oath to them so as to enable them to participate and cast their votes in the April 2 Senate election.
He contended that the high court had accepted the said petitions on March 27 and had directed the speaker to administer oath to the petitioners and also to allow and facilitate them in casting their votes in the Senate election.
He stated that not only the counsel for the respondents (speaker and deputy speaker) was present rather the order was pronounced in open court.
He stated that till date no oath taking had been arranged, thus openly defying the court’s order.
He stated that the respondents had been dragging their feet on the matter.
He argued that the speaker should have done necessary correspondence for requisitioning of the session of the assembly and including administering oath to the MPAs as agenda item No. 1 by April 2 but no process for oath taking had been arranged, thus openly defying the time-bound order of the high court.
It is pertinent to mention that on April 3, a bench of the high court had sought response of the speaker and deputy speaker to a contempt petition filed by four of the MPAs-elect seeking to initiate contempt proceedings against the speaker and the deputy speaker for not implementing the court order of taking oath from them.
Those petitioners have also requested the court to order disqualification of Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi from holding any public office as they had willfully flouted the March 27 order of the high court.
The speaker has also filed a review petition in the high court, requesting it to recall its order of March 27.
The speaker has stated that administering oath to the members was only possible when assembly session was summoned or requisitioned as per the mandate of Article 65 of the Constitution. He added that the speaker couldn’t summon a session on his own unless requisition was filed by one-fourth of the members of the assembly.

6,Artists’ community termed true ambassador of pluralistic society,ANP vows to stand with artists through thick and thin,"PESHAWAR: Speakers at an event held at Bacha Khan Markaz here the other day termed artists’ community true representative of a pluralistic and just society and their services should be recognised duly.
Unfortunately, artists and musicians didn’t get due status in our society and therefore their financial position remained pathetic due to lack of cultural activities, they said.
A free Eid food packages distribution ceremony was arranged under the auspices of Bacha Khan Patient’s Welfare Organisation (BKPWO) and Malgari Doctoran at Bacha Khan Markaz here.
Over 100 deserving artists, musicians and their families were given free Eid food packages comprising 10kg flour, 5kg sugar, one kg beans, a packet of spices and vermicelli for the upcoming Eid festival.

ANP vows to stand with artists through thick and thin

Roman Gul, an Afghan folk artist, told Dawn that he and his several colleagues couldn’t earn enough to support their families while Meena Arshad, a local female artist, remarked had the doors of Nishtar Hall opened on them, they could earn a decent livelihood.
Mian Iftikhar Hussain, general secretary of Awami National Party, on the occasion pointed out that the role of artists and musicians in promoting human values in the society was evident and their status should be upheld at all costs. Artists were ambassadors of peace, and goodwill in a pluralistic and just society, he added.
Mr Hussain stated that the doors of Nishtar Hall were open in his tenure to all kinds of literary and cultural activities while deserving artists and performers were helped out against the threat of militants, but, unfortunately, today artist’s community was forced to live in penury.
He regretted that artists and musicians were being degraded rather threatened for their contribution to the society and they never got their due status, while in other societies, artists ran charity projects. In our country artists were being forced to beg, he added.
My party would always stand by the artist’s community through thick and thin, assured the ANP leader.
Rashid Ahmad Khan, director of Angaze Music Production and chief of Artist’s Welfare Society (AWS), on behalf of Bacha Khan Markaz announced that folk singers and artists would be provided an opportunity to record their music pieces free of cost.
Dr Mohammad Shahzad, chairman BKPWO, said that his organisation had launched free of cost medical treatment of artists and performers to lessen their financial burden. Dr Haider Ali Khan chief of Malgari Doctran, Dr Sohaib Farrukh, Dr Nawaz Khalil and Dr Mujeeb also addressed the event.

KHYBER: The Landi Kotal Bazaar has reported high sales of traditional caps, which are worn by residents with Eid clothes.
Sellers offer a variety of caps with varying prices to customers, mostly youth and children, while elders prefer those with modest designs.
Iqbal Khan, a cap seller in Landi Kotal Bazaar, told Dawn that his sales had multiplied as Eidul Fitr drew closer.
“Parents and children consider their Eid preparations incomplete without new caps,” he said.
He said he sold caps from Bangladesh, China, Karachi, Dir, Charsadda, and Peshawar, but the youth preferred white ones from Charsadda and Peshawar.
“People mostly buy colourful caps for their children aged below 15,” he said.
The shopkeeper said handmade white caps from Dir were mostly liked by tribesmen over the age of 40.
He said handmade caps cost more than others.
“Bangladeshi, Chinese and Peshawari caps liked by youth because they’re lightweight, mostly machine-made, and have affordable prices,” he said.
Javed Khan, 24, said he inherited the cap business from his father, who migrated to Landi Kotal from Bajaur in 2002.
“My business picks up momentum days ahead of Eidul Fitr and Eidul Azha. In other months, it is business as usual for me,” he said.
The shopkeeper said the caps made in Wahid Garhi and Bakhshu Pul areas of Peshawar had become popular with the youth due to their light weight and fine finishing.
“Wearing a cap is our tradition. Any festive occasion is considered incomplete without the addition of a new cap to the youth’s wardrobe,” he said.
Mr Javed, however, regretted that the demand for traditional handmade white caps from Dir was gradually declining due to the “influx” of both imported and lightweight caps with colour and design variations.
People in Jamrud and Bara areas of Khyber tribal district said the demand for caps in the two tehsils was not as high as it was in Landi Kotal.
They said the tradition of wearing caps was fast fading away, with only the elderly strictly following it.
During its ‘occupation’ of Bara tehsil from 2005 to 2011, a local militant organisation, Lashkar-i-Islam, had made it mandatory for men to wear caps. However, the restriction eased after the 2012 elimination of the outfit in a military operation.
Turab Ali, a social activist, insisted that as tribal traditions were fast losing their appeal for local youth, they mostly wore caps or lungi to weddings and cultural events only.
Sajid Ali Kukikhel of Jamrud said tribal youth were more influenced by new fashion trends, while some among them insisted that caps “ruined” their hairstyles.
“Now, caps are mostly worn by youngsters for offering prayers. However, elders put on caps as a tradition,” he said.

Another resident, Abdul Razzaq, said Tanawal lacked basic facilities and development. “People of the erstwhile Amb and Pulrah states have been peacefully advocating the cause of Tanawal district for along time. The government should notify Tanawal as a separate district,” he said.
Mr Razzaq said the residents of Tanawal were still widely deprived of their basic amenities and development. “If the government is sincere about our development, it should declare Tanawal a district,” he said.
HELD: The police have claimed to have arrested around 100 drug peddlers and seized a large cache of narcotics across Mansehra district last week.
