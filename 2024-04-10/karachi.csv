1,CM urged to upgrade Wasa to ‘water board corporation’,HYDERABAD: Hyderabad Cha­mber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) has said that inefficiency of Water and Sanitation...,"HYDERABAD: Hyderabad Cha­mber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) has said that inefficiency of Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has caused insanitation in main markets and bazaars and urged Sindh chief minister to upgrade the agency to a corporation through reforms.
HCCI president Adeel Siddiqi said while speaking to representatives of various trade organisations during his visit to different markets on Tuesday that all main roads were overflowing with sewage, causing great difficulties to residents as well as motorists. 
He said that Wasa had failed to deliver and had become highly inefficient civic body. HCCI had received complaints from residents of other areas as well, he said. He said that traders and businessmen paid Rs60bn to provincial government in taxes and it was incumbent upon the government to announce a package for business community of Hyderabad.
He maintained that it was time that Sindh chief minister should upgrade Wasa to a ‘water board corporation’ and launch reforms in the civic body. Biometric system should be introduced in Wasa and number of sanitary workers should be increased, he said.
He said that filtration plants being managed by Wasa should be improved as well because these were providing drinking water to people. Legislation should be introduced in Wasa which should treat ‘vandalising of water supply lines’ as an offence, he suggested.
He proposed that members of HCCI and traders’ representatives and social figures should be inducted in the board of directors of the upgraded ‘water board corporation’ so that collective efforts should be made for better working of Wasa.
He said that legislation should be made to ensure disconnection of illegal connections and 100pc recovery of bills. Concessions and installments should be given to consumers on bills so that service delivery could be improved, he said.
Mr Siddiqui was informed by Anjuman Tajiran Cut Piece Cloth and General Merchants Mohammad Rashid Qureshi that HCCI had played an important role in resolving serious problems of shopkeepers. Traders were being facilitated by Hyderabad Electric Supply Company, Traffic Management etc, he said.

5,Chand raat brings up win-win situation for Karachi’s henna artists and their clients,There are rows after rows of chairs placed on the service road there to accommodate the henna artists and their clients.," 

Endless rows of chairs take over the service lane near Teen Talwar to accommodate henna artists and their clients on chand raat. A happy client (right) shows her decorated hand to her friends, on the eve of Eidul Fitr. — Shakil Adil / White Star

KARACHI: When every last minute detail for Eid has been taken care of by the ladies of the house, there is only one thing left to do … henna application. After that you can’t do much else as you have to wait for the henna to dry out before getting your hands into anything else.
And all these ladies could be found at Teen Talwar in Clifton looking for the best henna artists for the job. There are rows after rows of chairs placed on the service road there to accommodate the henna artists and their clients.
On Tuesday evening, there were all kinds of henna artists there. Experts, who charged more, in the vicinity of Rs500 to Rs800 per side and slightly less in expertise, who charged Rs200 to Rs300 per side. Most of these were applying henna designs to little girls’ palms as older clients were going for the experts for intricate designs. Many had also saved the designs of their choice in their phones to show to the henna artists to replicate.
Kanwal and her daughter were quite okay with the charges as they told Dawn that there is only this one night, chand raat, when they can go out to get their hands decorated with the fragrant henna. “Mehndi is at the heart of Eid. It is a tradition and has much to do with happiness and celebration. It also adds to the show of a new Eid dress and matching bangles,” said Kanwal, who also provided that they come to Teen Talwar every year for henna application.
Varda, the henna artist applying the mehndi, said that she is a student of Matric arts and doesn’t mind coming here every year to earn some extra pocket money. “I hope to make a nice amount for myself by the time we wrap up from here,” she said.
Radhika was another young henna artist. A student of Matric Science, she was charging Rs250 per side. There was also Uswa, who was doing her BA honours from the University of Karachi. She was charging Rs500 per side. Huma, the lady seated before her to get her hands decorated, said she had also come here last year for mehndiand Uswa had decorated her hands. “I was overjoyed to find her here again,” she said.
Fareeha was also studying at KU and said that she has been applying henna on chand raat since she was in class seven. “I used to also offer my services at beauty parlours but they cut into our earnings. If I am charging Rs300 here, there I would only be allowed to take home Rs100 while the parlour would have kept Rs200. So it is far better to come here and work for myself,” said the girl.
None of the henna artists were alone. All had their mother or older sister with them. Some said that their brother or father would come to pick them up when they are done at around 2am or later. Asked if they wouldn’t be afraid of going home with so much of the cash they have made so late, they smiled and shook their heads. “Actually, there is so much ronaq [liveliness] with people everywhere and bright lights on chand raat with also the police vigilant, there are no holdups expected,” said one mother of a henna artist who had come there from Ranchore Line.
Most clients were also not alone. They had come in groups, patiently awaiting their turn with an artist. Manaal was there for the first time as her friends Ayesha, Ayat and Hala had coaxed her into coming with them there. “My mother calls a henna artist at home for all this work. But today I came here to experience this ronaq,” smiled.
More groups had more friends, cousins from joint families, married sisters with their daughters, mothers and mother-in-laws with their daughters and daughter-in-laws all getting their hands decorated till late on chand raat. It was a win-win situation for both them and the henna artists.

6,Army officer shot by robbers in Karachi dies during treatment,Major Saad Sheikh is survived by a widow and two children including a son.,"KARACHI: A serving officer of the Pakistan Army, who was shot at and wounded by robbers in the city on March 31, died during treatment at a hospital, police and relatives said on Tuesday.
DIG-South Syed Asad Raza said that Major Saad Sheikh was posted at Pakistan Coast Guard in Hub. He said on March 31 he had left his office for Iftar on a motorcycle. The motorbike developed some fault and he took it to a mechanic near Gulbai where armed robbers on a motorbike arrived. 
He said that the major was in plain clothes and carrying his weapon. When the robbers saw his weapon they opened indiscriminate fire and fled without any loot. 
The wounded major was initially taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi from where he was taken to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Malir. He remained admitted there and died during treatment on Monday. 
The DIG said that the army officer suffered four bullet wounds.
Major Sheikh is survived by a widow and two children including a son.
On Tuesday, he was laid to rest with full military honours.
Regarding investigations of the case, the DIG said that the robbers had abandoned their motorbike while fleeing and the police seized it.
He claimed that investigators traced and identified those who killed the army officer.
Later in the evening, SSP-Keamari Faizan Ali claimed to have arrested one of the suspects, identified as Usman, involved in the killing of the major after an encounter. 
He said that the police also recovered a pistol used in the murder.

7,No respite from water crisis in Karachi even on Eid days,Supply from seven government hydrants to remain suspended till Thursday.,"KARACHI: While people continue to face acute water shortages in many parts of the metropolis on the eve of Eidul Fitr, there is no respite in sight from the water woes even during the three-day of the religious festival with suspension of supply through water bowsers for the next two days, it emerged on Tuesday.
The worst-hit will be the salubrious parts of the city, including Defence Housing Authority and Clifton, where residents mainly rely on supply of potable water through water bowsers.
Residents from almost every part of the city complained that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation had piled miseries on them during Ramazan as they faced acute water shortages in their respective areas.
A spokesman for the water utility, however, said that the KWSC had made special arrangements for supply and drainage of water across the city before and during Eid.

Supply from seven govt hydrants to remain suspended till Thursday

He said that water supply was affected in some parts of the city due to mechanical activities, adding that the supply had to be suspended for repair and maintenance work that led to water scarcity in some areas.
KWSC chief executive officer Syed Salahuddin Ahmed told Dawn that all pumping stations in the city were functioning normally and 520 million gallons of water per day was being supplied to the city from the Dhabeji Pumping Station.
“The demand of water has increased with the hot weather,” he said adding that effective measures for the supply and drainage of water would be taken around Eid gatherings, mosques, imambargahs, and schools throughout the city.
However, residents said that water had not flowed through the main pipelines for the past several days in their localities leaving them with no option but to be fleeced by mushrooming water tanker mafia to meet their daily requirement.
Tauseef Shah, resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal Block-13, said that the 2,000-gallon water tanker which they used to buy for Rs2,000 was now available at Rs5,000 to 6,000 in his area.
“It happens on every Eid,” he said adding that the tanker mafia with connivance of water utility officials minted millions of rupees each year during religious festivals.
In district Central, water shortage continued to hit residents who alleged that the water meant for the district was being supplied to other parts of the city.
They said that the Sakhi Hasan Hydrant was closed for the past three days due to shortage of water, thus depriving the residents of alternative arrangement for water supply.
Sources said that the Sakhi Hasan Hydrant was made operational only for eight hours to supply water in the district.
Meanwhile, the water utility said that the supply of water through tankers from seven official hydrants would remain suspended on Wednesday and Thursday as the tanker drivers would not turn up at duty due to Eid celebrations.
In charge of hydrant cell Elahi Bux Bhutto said that there were 2,800 registered water tankers supplying 12 to 15 MGD water to various parts of the city.
He said that the water tanker service remained closed on the first two days of Eid as drivers went to holidays.

9,"PPP under fire from opposition PTI, Jamaat over surge in street crime, killings in Karachi",Haleem Adil Sheikh demands resignation of Sindh police chief.,"KARACHI: A day after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan demanded that Karachi be handed over to the army, the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Jamaat-i-Islami on Tuesday expressed serious concerns over the deteriorating security situation in the province, particularly the metropolis, and blamed the Pakistan Peoples Party government for failing to curb crimes.
While PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh demanded the resignation of the Sindh police chief, recently elected JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman reiterated his demand to purge the Sindh police of “black sheep” and induct local residents in the force.
Speaking at a press conference, PTI’s Sheikh condemned an alarming rise in incidents of street crime and murders in Karachi and held the PPP-led Sindh government responsible for “rampant corruption and violence”.
He said that over the past three months, 58 Karachiites had lost their lives while resisting robberies. He said only in the month of Ramazan, around 20 citizens were killed by robbers. 
Talking about the poor security situation in other parts of the province, Mr Sheikh noted that over the course of a year, dacoits in Kandhkot and Kashmore abducted more than 400 people. He said that even police confirmed that 35 to 40 individuals were still in the custody of the riverine area gangs.
He demanded the resignation of the Sindh inspector general of policce over failing to maintain law and order both in urban and rural areas of the province.
PTI leader Jamal Siddiqui accused the PPP of having no interest in the welfare of Karachi and its people and alleged that the police were compromised and ineffective due to political interference.
The leaders called for accountability and immediate action to address the worsening security and economic situation in Sindh.
Hafiz Naeem visits slain workers’ home
The JI also condemned the PPP government in Sindh over an alarming surge in street crime in Karachi.
Hafiz Naeem, who visited the families of slain JI members killed during robbery bids recently, told the media that around 20 innocent Karachities had been killed by street criminals in the month of Ramazan. 
He said that the people of Karachi had been left at the mercy of street criminals. He lambasted the police high-ups and the home minister over their “total failure in handling crimes and criminals” in Karachi.
On the occasion, he reiterated his demand to purge the Sindh police of black sheep and induct locals in the police.
He was of the view that community policing was the only way to bring peace and maintain law and order in the mega city.

10,Is the cinema business under threat?,"Watching films on big screen has become an elitist affair, opines Ahmed Shah","• Watching films on big screen has become an elitist affair, opines Ahmed Shah
• Experts believe footfall will improve if govt allows screening of Indian movies          
KARACHI: The much bandied about phrase ‘revival of the film industry’ doesn’t seem to hold true anymore. A visit on a public holiday or weekend to Karachi’s multiplexes will not give an impression of bustling recreational spots. The business of those who run single or multiple screens now largely depends on Hollywood releases, especially its tent-pole ventures. 
The last Pakistani film that made its presence felt in a resounding way was The Legend of Maula Jatt (2022) directed by Bilal Lashari. Ever since, there’s been a lull in cinema houses in terms of footfall. 
It would be difficult to recall which local movie saw the light of day after Maula Jatt that created a ripple in the placid waters of cinema business. In the last decade or so there have not been many films that raked in considerable chunks of money for their makers. Punjab Nahin Jaongi filled up cinema halls in quick time, but that happened in 2017.
According to one estimate, for 250 million people in this country there are only 60 cinemas and 150 screens. Even if this is hard to corroborate, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that for such a huge population the number of cinemas is not sufficient. What also needs to be analysed is whether Pakistani filmmakers have their finger on the public’s entertainment pulse.
Talking to Dawn, Arts Council president Ahmed Shah, who hosts discussions on the film industry at the council’s flagship events such as the Urdu Conference, said, “To be honest, our industry never sprang back to its feet after Gen Ziaul Haq’s era. Until you give liberty to the creative lot to make films on subjects they wish to touch upon, it won’t happen. Another important aspect in that regard is that film business is shifting to OTT platforms. Film is no more the medium of the poor or the underprivileged. In the old days, a rickshawala or tonga wala used to save money to go to cinema. Not anymore. It is an elitist affair now. I’m in favour of having more screens, but they should be in neighbourhoods such as Landhi, Korangi and F.B. Area.”
Painting a larger picture, Mr Shah pointed out that the overall situation in Karachi is no different arguing not many people stepped out of their houses to watch PSL matches. 
This was the sentiment echoed by renowned director and actor Mohammed Ehteshamuddin, who has Superstar and Dum Mastam to his directorial credit, “The film industry reflects society, that is, every other field. In fact, it isn’t an industry anymore because no one is willing to invest in it. This just doesn’t have to do with the government… there are other factors involved. While film business has been affected all over the world due to new technological devices, they have found ways to counter it. They create magic through IMAX and other experiments etc in a big way which compels people to queue up to watch movies in theatres. We make some good films and some not-so-good ones, but we make so few of them that the ratio doesn’t matter.” 
Will re-permitting Indian movies to screen in Pakistan make a difference? Mr Shah answered, “Indian movies should be screened here. You may remember when they were shown, people used to go to cinema houses in droves. There were houseful shows. As a result of that, people would also have a good look at posters for Pakistani films and watched them.”
Ehteshamuddin said, “We live in a global village. We get to see stuff being made in other countries. If we have Indian movies in our country footfall in cinemas will improve (cinema aabaad ho ga). Otherwise, the small number of theatres that we have, they might shut down. In that respect a policy could be made to see which films from across the border can be shown and which can’t. The policy should also entail that Indian distributors can screen our films if they want to.”
Seasoned actor Behroz Sabzawri expressed a similar opinion.
“I can guarantee (likh lein) the moment you permit Indian films to be shown, things will improve. Some cinema owners are my close friends. In their private conversations they share these views. You see, India makes trash movies but good films, too. Having them here would help increase revenue,” he added.
The experts touched on a couple of other issues as well. 
Ehteshamuddin mentioned the high prices of tickets and suggested that there should be a discounted amount for students so that a movie-watching culture could be developed.
Sabzwari said, “The most important thing is we should give a free hand to our filmmakers. Reality-based films always work.”

11,Two Urdu films set to hit cinemas on Eid,Daghabaaz Dil is directed by Wajahat Rauf while Noman Khan made Hum Tum Aur Wo,"KARACHI: It is utterly disappointing that only two Pakistani films are getting released on Eidul Fitr. What could be more festive than Eid? And yet, there aren’t enough local cinematic ventures to entertain the public. The films that are going to see the light of day on Eid are: Daghabaaz Dil and Hum Tum Aur Wo.
This clearly suggests that neither the producers are willing to invest in movies nor there seem to be sparkling ideas coming from filmmakers. It is worrisome both on commercial and creative levels. To boot, the Hollywood films hitting the cinema screens on Eid don’t boast of big, A-list names. Where is cinema business headed?
Daghabaas Dil is directed by Wajahat Rauf who has film such as Karachi Se Lahore and Lahore Se Aagey to his credit. It has Mehwish Hayat, Ali Rehman, Babar Ali, Salim Sheikh and Beo Rana Zafar in the cast. 
Hum Tum Aur Wo is helmed by Noman Khan. A few days back its lead actress Amna Ilyas was in the news for posting on social media her displeasure at the fact that the project was meant to be a telefilm and not for cinema. Junaid Khan is her co-actor in the movie.

Daghabaaz Dil is directed by Wajahat Rauf while Noman Khan made Hum Tum Aur Wo

Only two films in the national language on Eid is a serious shortcoming. While one wishes that they do well at the box office, the number of releases is insufficient. 
Television dramas have gained a lot of viewership in recent times (which has always been the case, actually). Does it suggest that cinema will now have a niche market and not a mass following? Time will tell.

The investigation officer (IO) of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) produced Head Constable Azharuddin before Judicial Magistrate (East) Muhammad Waqas Afzal after getting one-day physical custody, requesting to extend the custody for further interrogation.
However, the court dismissed the IO’s request and ordered the suspect to be sent to prison.
During previous proceedings, the IO informed the court that acting on a tip-off, the CTD conducted a raid near the KMC Sports Complex on Kashmir Road and apprehended the suspect in possession of pistols in a school bag.
The CTD’s intelligence wing claimed to have recovered five pistols of 30 bore and 9mm calibre from the suspect. Since the suspect failed to produce licenses for the pistols, the CTD registered an FIR under Section 34-A of the Sindh Arms Act 2013.
According to the remand report, the suspect had previously been involved in the smuggling of illicit arms into Karachi and was associated with Daniyal, a resident of the KP, who was a key accomplice of three arms dealers in KP — Qadeer, Saddam and Nadeem.
The police stated that the detained suspect was a serving policeman in the KP police force and part of an interprovincial arms smuggling network engaged in illegal weapons’ sales through social media channels, supplying them to Karachi and other parts of the country.

14,Booking office removed from military  land as builder fails to complete procedures,Quarter Master General Branch warns public against any activity on its property,"HYDERABAD: A piece of commercial land (1289.38 sq-yds) belonging to the Military Estate Office (MEO) has been got vacated from a builder, who claims to be owner of the pricy property. 
The builder, Kashif Amin, is in the process of purchasing the land for Rs1.4 billion since becoming the highest bidder in an auction, an MEO official said on Tuesday. 
However, the MEO removed the builder’s office, set up in twin containers, functioning at the site for about a month. A visit to the site revealed that the site had now been sealed with barbed wires from two sides/corners. 
A banner has been erected at the site informing the general public that “the land is owned by the QMG (Quarter Master General Branch”. The banner read: ‘Ye zameen army (Quarter Master General branch) ki milkiyat hey. Iss zameen par kisi bhi qisam ki sargarmi sakhti say mana hey: ba-hukum QMG branch.
The land-related affairs of the MEO are looked after by the QMG branch in Rawalpindi.

Quarter Master General Branch warns public against any activity on its property

MEO Hyderabad Chaudhry Babar neither attended calls nor did he reply Dawn’s message sent to him on Tuesday to explain why this action was taken though the site was meant for a commercial plaza. Likewise, Kashif Amin and his younger brother, Danish Amin, appeared not willing to share their position. Kashif Amin didn’t respond to the messages sent to him through his mobile phone nor did he attend phone calls. Danish Amin, however, spoke to Dawn but only to say that he would get back later as he was busy somewhere. “You have already reported [the matter] earlier, therefore, you may report whatever you know [about the fresh development]. I will talk to you later,” he said.
The builder had been floating his company’s promotional stuff targeting potential buyers through Whatsapp messages and other social media means. The company was offering booking of spaces on 30pc down payment. Different numbers of contact persons were given by the company and one of such numbers (0300-3111175) belonged to Mohammad Ali Shaikh.
When Mr Shaikh was contacted on Tuesday, he claimed that “there was some parking issue and that’s why the Cantonment [board] authorities sealed the site. A contractor of the Cantonment was using it as a charged parking area and collecting parking fee from people”. 
He said that a one-month pre-launch time was given to his cousin, Kashif Amin, which had since expired and now booking office would work from [a new place on] Autobhan Road after Eidul Fitr. 
He could not explain why the site was sealed when it had been auctioned to his cousin.
The Cantonment Board Hyderabad (CBH) has been maintaining silence on the issue but insisting that the land [as of now] belongs to the MEO.
The plot in question is located paces away from the CBH and the Station Headquarters. 
According to sources in the CBH, the builder had opened his business office, just before Ramazan, without obtaining necessary approval, supposed to be granted by the QMG. No building plan was approved by the CBH. “Both these processes involve several stages and certain procedures were also yet to be completed; but the builder opened the office at the site,” said an official.
MEO Babar had previously claimed, while talking to Dawn, that the approval for the Rs1.4bn project by the office concerned under defence ministry had not yet been issued. He had also pointed out that the successful bidder had reportedly sought time till March 25 from the relevant forum in the ministry for depositing the one/tenth of the bid amount, i.e. Rs140m. “I can’t say with certainty that he is allowed the time by the ministry,” Babar had told Dawn.
Some social media activists had lately been raising the issue of the builder’s commercial activities arguing that he was using the MEO land for commercial purposes without having been given necessary approval and without getting the building plan of his project approved.

The WAF delegation consisting of Amar Sindhu, Dr Arfana Mallah, Dr Haseen Musarrat and others met with Hyderabad senior superintendent of police (SSP) 
Amjad Shaikh and voiced concerns over rumour mongering about the case and character assassination campaign 
against Priya’s mother.
The delegation sought information about progress on Priya and other high-profile cases. SSP Shaikh, who was inquiry officer of the Priya case, shared investigation so far into the case and rejected all social media reports about the case.
He said that police, however, had not so far found any conclusive findings in the case but they had not lost hope for her recovery. Police were not sure about the place where she had held captive, he clarified.
He said that police were probe the case from all angles and termed speculative all reports on social media that pointed to her place of captivity and her life. Similarly, all reports about Priya’s mother were baseless, he said.
