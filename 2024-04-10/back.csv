2,Pakistan smiles brighter than India in UN happiness report,"Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Australia among top 10","Pakistan has once again stolen the spotlight from India in the latest United Nations-backed Happiness Report, retaining its 108th position while India lagged behind at 126th in the rankings released on Wednesday.
Finland remained the world's happiest country for a seventh straight year while Nordic countries kept their places among the 10 most cheerful, with Denmark, Iceland and Sweden trailing Finland.
Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Australia claimed the remaining spots in the top 10.
Afghanistan, plagued by a humanitarian catastrophe since the Taliban regained control in 2020, stayed at the bottom of the 143 countries surveyed.
For the first time since the report was published more than a decade ago, the United States and Germany were not among the 20 happiest nations, coming in 23rd and 24th respectively.
In turn, Costa Rica and Kuwait entered the top 20 at 12 and 13.
The report noted the happiest countries no longer included any of the world's largest countries.
""In the top 10 countries only the Netherlands and Australia have populations over 15 million. In the whole of the top 20, only Canada and the UK have populations over 30 million.""
The sharpest decline in happiness since 2006-10 was noted in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Jordan, while the Eastern European countries including Serbia, Bulgaria and Latvia reported the biggest increases.
The happiness ranking is based on individuals' self-assessed evaluations of life satisfaction, as well as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity and corruption.
This year, for the first time, a separate list of countries by age was also compiled. Lithuania ranked first for happiness among under-30s. Pakistan is ranked 107, India 127 and Bangladesh 128.
Similarly, in the list of people aged 60 years and above, Denmark was first, Pakistan at 112, India at 121 and Bangladesh at 120.
In this list of 143 countries, the last 20 countries have been included in the 20 unhappiest countries in the world, with Afghanistan at the top. Unhappy countries include Yemen, Jordan, Egypt, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, along with India.
Growing inequality
Jennifer De Paola, a happiness researcher at the University of Helsinki in Finland, told AFP that Finns' close connection to nature and healthy work-life balance were key contributors to their life satisfaction.
In addition, Finns may have a ""more attainable understanding of what a successful life is"", compared to for example the United States where success is often equated with financial gain, she said.
Finns' strong welfare society, trust in state authorities, low levels of corruption and free healthcare and education were also key.
""Finnish society is permeated by a sense of trust, freedom, and high level of autonomy,"" De Paola said.
This year's report also found that younger generations were happier than their older peers in most of the world's regions -- but not all.
In North America, Australia and New Zealand, happiness among groups under 30 has dropped dramatically since 2006-10, with older generations now happier than the young.
By contrast, in Central and Eastern Europe, happiness increased substantially at all ages during the same period, while in Western Europe people of all ages reported similar levels of happiness.
Happiness inequality increased in every region except Europe, which authors described as a ""worrying trend"".
The rise was especially distinct among the old and in Sub-Saharan Africa, reflecting inequalities in ""income, education, health care, social acceptance, trust, and the presence of supportive social environments at the family, community and national levels,"" the authors said.

3,Hyderabad’s delicacy: Eid bangles go from furnace to forearms,"Over a dozen may contribute to crafting a single bangle, from factories to skilled designers decorating them by hand","Layers of intricately decorated bangles are a staple fashion accessory for women, a carefully considered part of their Eidul Fitr celebrations.
More than a dozen people can be involved in the making of a single bangle, from sweltering factories to the homes of designers who skilfully decorate them by hand.
""Whatever the fashion trends, when we attend any event and wear any outfit it feels incomplete without bangles,"" said 42-year-old Talat Zahid, who uses beads, stitching and embroidery to embellish bangles.
""Even if you don't wear jewellery but wear bangles or a bracelet with your outfit, the outfit looks complete.""
In the lead-up to this week's Eidul Fitr festivities that mark the end of Ramazan, market stalls are adorned with a glittering array of colourful bangles, each turned over and inspected for their beauty and imperfections by women who haggle for a good price.
They are often sold by the dozen, starting at around Rs150 and rising to Rs1,000 as stones and silk are added.
Hyderabad is home to the delicate ""churi"" glass bangle, where a single furnace can produce up to 100 bangles an hour from molten glass wire shaped around an iron rod.
The work is arduous and frustrating – labourers are exposed to oppressive temperatures in unregulated factories prone to frequent power cuts, while the fragile glass threads can snap easily.
""The work is done without a fan. If we turn on the fan the fire is extinguished. So, the heat intensity is high. As it becomes hotter our work slows down,"" said 24-year-old Sameer, who followed his father into the industry and earns less than the minimum wage of Rs32,000 a month.
After the partition of British-ruled India in 1947, migrating Muslims who had produced bangles in the Indian city of Firozabad took their trade to Hyderabad –- where hundreds of thousands of people rely on the industry.
But soaring gas prices after the government slashed subsidies have forced many factories to close or to operate at reduced hours.
""The speed at which the government has increased the gas prices and taxes, (means) the work in this area has started to shrink instead of expand,"" said 50-year-old factory owner Muhammad Nafees.
Most bangles leave the factory as plain loops, sent off to be embellished to different degrees by women who work from home, before they're finally passed on to traders to be sold in markets. The production is often a family affair.
Saima Bibi, 25, works from home, carefully adding stones to bangles with the help of her three children when they return from school, while her husband works at the furnaces.
""They go through a lot of hands to be prepared,"" she said. AFP

5,HPSB meeting not held for 13 months,CSB huddle for promotion of grade-21 and -20 officers was also held seven months ago,"The meeting of the high-powered selection board (HPSB) for the promotion of bureaucrats to grade-22 has not been held for 13 months.
Besides, the Central Selection Board (CSB) meeting for the promotion of grade-21 and -20 officers was also held seven months ago.
During the Pakistan Democratic Movement regime, the HPSB’s meeting was held on March 2, 2023.
Later, the CSB meeting was held from August 1, 2023 to August 4, 2023.
As a result of the general elections on February 8 this year, the PML-N has completed the process of forming the government including the Senate polls.
The bureaucrats said the board meetings should be held twice a year to consider their promotion.
During the caretaker government, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not allow the Establishment Division to convene a meeting of the HPSB for the promotion of officials.
The officials said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should direct the Establishment Division not to allow any further delay in the process of promotion in the bureaucracy and hold a meeting of the HPSB and CSB immediately.
The last time a meeting of the HPSB was held was in March 2023.
Back then, over 20 officers were promoted from grade-21 to grade-22.
In August, the interim government promoted 26 officers to grade-20, against 243 vacant positions.
The CSB he Board recommended the promotions of 24 PAS officers in BS-21, 26 in BS-20, nine  officers of Police Service of Pakistan in BS-21, 22 in BS-21, 10 officers of Foreign Service of Pakistan in BS-21, 17 in BS-20, one officer of Inter-Services Intelligence in BS-21 and one in BS-20, six officers of Inland Revenue Service in BS-21, 19 in BS-20, six officers of Pakistan Custom Service in BS-21, 20 in BS-20.
The CSB also recommended promotions of 42 ex-cadres officers to grade 20 and 21.
Out of those who could not be promoted, 33 officers were not considered as their assets declaration forms were not brought on the board’s record.

6,Saudis to up their deposits in SBP by $2b,Riyadh to set up $14b oil refinery and $7b copper mine in Pakistan,"Riyadh and Islamabad have reached an agreement to surge the Saudi deposits in the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) by $2 billion – increasing them from $3 billion to $5 billion.
Saudi Arabia Holding Company CEO Mohammad AlQahtani in a social media post shared that following the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Saudi Arabia and his meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the two countries have agreed to step up the implementation of the $5 billion “massive” plan.
The pact was made between PM Shehbaz and the Saudi crown prince in Makkah on Monday during the premier’s three-day visit to seek economic support from the Kingdom.
The two leaders discussed ways for strengthening bilateral ties with special focus on Kingdom’s supportive role in Pakistan’s economy and the mutual desire to strengthen trade and investment ties, according to a joint communique issued simultaneously from Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of the meeting.
“Both parties affirmed their commitment to expediting the first wave of investment package worth $5 billion, which was discussed previously,” it added.
AlQahtani explained that the agreements included injecting investments into a new oil refinery and copper mines.
The Saudi Arabia Holding Company CEO elaborated that these steps were part of a broader agreement reached earlier, where Riyadh was in talks to invest $21 billion in Islamabad.
He added that they included the setting up of an oil refinery at cost of $14 billion and a copper mine at a sum of $7 billion.
Last year, Saudi Arabia had pledged to invest $25 billion in Pakistan within the next five years under the Spe¬cial Investment Facilita¬tion Council (SIFC), which was seeking investments in the energy, information technology, minerals, defence, and agricultural sectors from the Gulf countries.
The Saudis are expected to invest $5 billion in the minerals sector, particularly in the Reko Diq Copper-Gold Project located in the Chaghi district of Pakistan’s Balochistan province.
AlQahtani further wrote that these investments were seen as a positive step towards strengthening economic relations between Islamabad and Riyadh, supporting Pakistan’s economy as well as creating new job opportunities.
He added that PM Shehbaz had described this agreement as 'historic"" and a ""milestone"" in the relationship between the two countries.
“The investments come at a time when Pakistan is facing a severe economic crisis, with high inflation rates and a shortage of foreign currency. Pakistan hopes that these investments will help improve its economy and create new job opportunities. Pakistan has a strong and reliable ally in Saudi Arabia, which has been providing extensive financial and political support for a long time,” he wrote.

7,UNSC urged to implement Gaza ceasefire resolution,Ambassador Akram calls for admitting Palestine as a full member of United Nations,"Pakistan has urged the UN Security Council to take appropriate measures to ensure implementation “in letter and spirit” of its resolution seeking ceasefire in the war-torn Gaza and called for imposing an an immediate ban on the export of weapons and ammunition to Israel.
Speaking in the General Assembly, Pakistan’s Permanent Represented Ambassador Munir Akram demanded of the Security Council to hold Israel responsible for its crimes against the Palestinian people in the enclave.
The 193-member Assembly met on Monday to debate the use of veto on the Middle East situation and the Palestinian Question. The session was called after the veto of a draft resolution submitted by the United States.
Ambassador Akram reiterated Pakistan’s unflinching support for the admission of Palestine as a full member of the United Nations, saying, “This step will make a Palestinian state a political reality and inevitability.” He expressed his disappointment at Israel’s non-compliance with the ceasefire resolution.
Noting that the vetoed resolution contained several positive elements, Akram said there were significant deficiencies in it, particularly the absence of a demand for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, which had the overwhelming support of the entire UN membership.
The criticised the vetoed resolution for its failure to address Israel’s military actions adequately, including the killing of innocent Palestinians and the absence of reference to the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) preliminary findings and recommendations.
Referring to Israel’s military campaign against Gaza, Ambassador Akram underscored the urgency of a ceasefire, condemning Israel’s actions that resulted in the loss of thousands of innocent lives, targeting of essential infrastructure, and obstruction of humanitarian aid.
He called for the revival of the peace process, inclusive of key Arab and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries, saying, “The brutality and bloodshed in Gaza has persisted for too long. These must end now, and their recurrence must be prevented through a durable two-state solution.”
