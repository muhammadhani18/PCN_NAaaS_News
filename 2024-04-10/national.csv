0,Islamabad Bar Council slams move against Justice Kayani,"Attempts being made to erode public trust in judiciary, notes bar council","ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad Bar Council (IBC) on Tuesday condemned and denounced a “baseless” and “frivolous reference” against Islamabad High Court senior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Dawn.com reported.
A day earlier, a former office-bearer of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had filed a complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Kayani. 
Former IHCBA general secretary Mohammad Waqas alleged that IHC Justice Kayani “waged a war against the forces of Pakistan in a planned manner by inducing and convincing other judges of high court”.
Justice Kayani is among the six judges who recently wrote a letter to the SJC detailing alleged harassment at the hands of state institutions. In the letter, the judges had accused the intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.

Attempts being made to erode public trust in judiciary, notes bar council 

In a statement released on Tuesday, the Islamabad Bar Council said Vice Chairman Adil Aziz Qazi expressed deep concern and strongly condemned the move. The filing of the “baseless reference” was deemed to be an “affront to the esteemed judiciary” and was regarded as a “blatant abuse” of the legal process, he added.
According to the statement, Justice Kayani had served the judiciary with the “utmost dedication, impartiality and integrity”, adding that the judge’s “unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law and dispensing justice fairly is commendable and beyond reproach”.
It said it was “imperative” for the legal community as the guardians of justice to “vehemently condemn such malicious attempts to undermine the judiciary and tarnish the reputation of our esteemed judges”, adding that “frivolous references” not only wasted valuable judicial resources but also eroded public trust in the legal system.
The bar council statement added that the IBC unequivocally condemned the filing of the complaint, stood in solidarity with the judge and reaffirmed the body’s unwavering support for judicial independence and integrity. “Let it be known that the legal fraternity will not tolerate any attempts to undermine the sanctity of our judicial institutions,” it concluded.

3,Of ‘protest iftars’ and mingling with other faiths,Muslims in United States experience Ramazan in a multitude of settings.," 

PEOPLE break their fast at the Hussain Masjid in Woodbridge, Virginia, during an Iftar held to promote harmony amongst all sects.—Aziz Jatoi

WASHINGTON: As the sun gently dips below the horizon, marking the end of another day of fasting, I find myself among fellow Muslims gathering for iftar.
The air is tinged with anticipation, my eyes automatically searching for the comforting sight of pakoras, samosas, and Rooh Afza. However, my heart sinks a little; they are nowhere to be found. Resigned, I reach for a simple glass of water.
“Sometimes, it feels fitting to break our fast with something as elemental as water,” muses Shah Jee, a Pakistani-American hailing from Lahore.
Even at a recent iftar at the offices of The Washington Times newspaper, where I had expected a lavish spread, the absence of those cherished delights was palpable. Just as I resigned myself to breaking my fast with water, a stranger, later introduced as Dave, a Jewish man, kindly offered me dates.

Muslims in United States experience Ramazan in a multitude of settings

This iftar at the paper’s offices was hosted by a group of Muslims who recently visited Israel. Though the discourse navigated themes of harmony and shared values among Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the focus was not on the pressing need for peace in Gaza.
Culturally enriching
This Ramazan, the Muslim community has had the privilege of experiencing several other iftars in a multitude of settings.
The most culturally enriching was the iftar in Springfield, Virginia, arranged by a group called Make Space on the evening of Jummatul Wida (the last Friday of Ramazan). It proved to be not only a memorable spiritual occasion but also a distinctive culinary delight for food enthusiasts.
Around 400 participants contributed homemade dishes, fostering a sharing of culinary delights from diverse regions. Amid the feasting, prayers were offered for peace in Gaza and for an immediate ceasefire.
The event was a diverse gathering, with an equal representation of women and men, and it transcended sectarian divides as well, as Make Space discourages such divisions.
‘Protest iftars’
In Washington, one of the major iftars was hosted at the Pakistan Embassy, where a significant number of guests were US officials and diplomats from various nations. The embassy also invited representatives of other religions — Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs — to its iftars and encourages them to address the gatherings.
And a Shia Islamic Centre, Shah-i-Najaf, invited their Sunni friends every weekend during this Ramazan. At this, and the Turkish mosque in Lanham, guests witnessed firsthand the spirit of hospitality and generosity that defines Ramazan. Despite theological differences, they came together as one community.
Two ‘protest iftars’ also took place. The first occurred outside the IMF headquarters during a protest organised by PTI USA, leading to the IMF allowing participants to observe iftar and perform Maghrib prayers under their roof.
Subsequently, a coalition of Muslim organisations arranged a protest iftar outside the White House, while President Joe Biden hosted some Muslim leaders at his official residence.
Mosques in New York, however, also served another purpose this Ramazan — sheltering refugees from African countries.
Many mosques opened their doors to these migrants during the daylight hours to rest and recover, oftentimes following restless nights sleeping on the streets or in the subway. During the last 10 days, many spent their nights as well.
Zahid Hussain Bukhari, executive director of the Council for Social Justice in Washington, says there are almost 3,500 mosques in the United States.
“Mosques are increasingly becoming community hubs where Muslims extend invitations to people of other faiths for events like iftar, particularly significant during the last 10 days of Ramazan,” he said.

4,Cop martyred in shooting on outskirts of Peshawar,He was returning home after offering taraveeh prayers at a mosque when he was targeted in Sheikh Muhammadi village.,"PESHAWAR: A police officer was martyred when unidentified attackers targeted him in the Badaber village on the outskirts of provincial capital, late on Monday night, while two militants were killed in an intelligence-based operation in South Waziristan district.
Police said when assistant sub-inspector Maroof Shah was returning home after offering taraveeh prayers at a mosque when he was targeted in Sheikh Muhammadi village on the outskirts of Peshawar.

The martyr cop was later laid to rest in his ancestral village.
Two militants killed
Separately, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in South Waziristan district, according to the military’s media wing.
The Inter-Services Public Relations said two militants were killed in an intense fire exchange during the operation.
It said that weapons along with a large quantity of explosives were also recovered from the slain militants, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area as security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” the ISPR statement added.

5,"Events may lead to another ‘Dhaka tragedy’, PTI warns","In message from jail, Imran reminds powers that be that countries and institutions can not survive without stable economy.","ISLAMABAD: Drawing a parallel between current developments in Pakistan with the circumstances leading to the 1971 Dhaka tragedy, PTI founding chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday warned that the present situation could result in economic collapse, reminding the powers that be that countries and institutions could not survive without stable economy.
Sharing Mr Khan’s message during a presser at National Press Club after the party’s legal team met him in Adiala Jail, PTI Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan said Salman Akram Raja, Intazar Panjutha, Shoaib Shaheen and Naeem Panjutha were among those who met the incarcerated ex-PM.
Barrister Raja told the media Mr Khan looked determined, though worried for the country and its people. “When you don’t give rights to the people, you cannot say the economy will grow. In 1970, army chief Yahya Khan wanted a hung parliament, but when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s party got a clear majority army held a fraud by-election in which 80 seats of Awami League were snatched as Yahya Khan wanted to become president,” he said, while narrating the PTI founder’s message.
“I want to remind Hamoodur Rahman Commission report that we are again going to repeat the same blunders which we made in the past. In 1970 there was London Plan and today again a government has been imposed through London Plan,” Barrister Raja quoted Mr Khan as saying.
However, he said, time and again he hinted that he was ready to talk to the military establishment, claiming that it would be in the best interest of the country.
On the occasion, Shoaib Shaheen said special prosecutors were not attending hearings in cases against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi due to which proceedings were being delayed.
Intazar Panjutha said Mr Khan compared the current situation of Pakistan with 1971 and warned that it would result in economic collapse and when economy collapses countries and institutions do not survive.

6,ECC meeting ‘extended to take provinces on board’,"Meeting ""reconvened"" on April 5, says statement.","ISLAMABAD: A recent meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet, which reviewed wheat procurement targets, was extended to a second day in order to take the provinces on board, a finance ministry official told Dawn.
The ECC meeting, held last week, was supposed to approve summaries for the provinces’ cash credit limits, among other matters. During the meeting, it was suggested that the provinces should also be consulted, and their representatives were invited to give their input via Zoom, the official said.
The Ministry of Finance did not issue its customary concluding statement after the meeting ended on April 5.
But a statement issued subsequently said that after considering the views of the relevant federal ministries, ECC members “felt that it would be advisable to include the provincial governments in the deliberations”.
This was why the meeting was “reconvened” on April 5, the statement said.
