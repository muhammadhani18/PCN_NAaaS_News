• Ali Zafar, Azam Tarar disagree over definition of ‘duly constituted’ in Article 60 of Constitution
• Khawaja Asif says PTI ‘treading path of chaos’
ISLAMABAD: Amid raucous protest and walk-out by PTI members, PPP’s Senator Yousuf Raza Gillani and PML-N’s Senator Syedaal Khan Nasar were elected unopposed as the Senate chairman and deputy chairman, respectively, on Tuesday.
Mr Gillani, the joint candidate of the PML-N-led ruling coalition, now holds the distinction of being elected to three of the four top constitutional offices — the president, prime minister, National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman.
He served as the PM from March 25, 2008 to June 19, 2012 and as NA speaker from October 17, 1993 to February 16, 1997.
He is the second Senate chairman to have been elected unopposed, the first being Mian Raza Rabbani, also from PPP.
Shortly after announcing Mr Gillani’s victory, the presiding officer, Senator Ishaq Dar, took oath from the newly elected Senate chairman.
Mr Gillani then took his seat at the helm, announced his deputy’s victory, and administered the oath.
Senator Khan, the deputy chairman, was elected to the house from Balochistan on PML-N’s ticket and was nominated by his party colleague Azam Nazeer Tarar and PPP’s Sherry Rehman.
Slogans and protests
The announcement of Mr Gillani’s victory was followed by loud slogans of “long live Bhutto” raised by PPP activists sitting in visitors’ galleries.
However, their chants failed to drown the noise of PTI senators who protested over the elections of Senate chairman and deputy chairman in an “incomplete house”.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 11 seats in Senate are vacant as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had postponed the election due to a controversy over the delay in administration of oath to KP assembly members elected on reserved seats.
PTI senators gathered in front of the chairman’s dais and raised the slogans of “mandate thieves” and “who will save Pakistan: Imran Khan, Imran Khan”.
Later, PTI staged a walk-out from the house.
Earlier in the day, 41 out of the 43 newly elected senators took oaths and signed the roll after their names were called one by one by the Senate secretary.
JUI-F’s Senator-elect Maulana Abdul Wasay and independent Senator-elect Faisal Vawda could not take oath as they were absent from the sitting.
‘Here to build bridges’
In remarks after taking the oath, Mr Gillani recalled the hanging of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
A visibly emotional Mr Gillani noted that the Supreme Court recently “acknowledged the judicial murder and admitted this historical injustice”.
“Currently, the crisis is deep. Pakistan faces an assault from those who seek to divide and polarise us. Those who seek to incite hatred. Those who seek to replace norms of civility with abuse and demagoguery,” he said.
“PPP has always rejected the politics of hate and preferred politics of reconciliation and of the welfare of the people.”
“I will be the chairman of the entire House, and my ambition is to build bridges, enable dialogue, and provide a space which allows for meaningful, robust discussion and disagreements within parliamentary norms and conventions and, most importantly, for the progress of the country,” the Senate chairman asserted.
PTI stages walk-out
At the outset of the sitting, PTI said that the election of Senate chairman and deputy chairman was unconstitutional because the 96-member house was incomplete since elections weren’t held on 11 seats from KP.
The party demanded the election be postponed till the house was completed and Senate elections were held in KP.
While speaking on a point of order, PTI’s parliamentary leader, Senator Ali Zafar, referred to Articles 59 and 60 of the Constitution and said the election of Senate chairman and deputy chairman couldn’t be held unless the house has been “duly constituted and all senators elected from four provinces don’t take oath”.
The election to the two positions without complete representation of a province would be tantamount to damaging the federation, said Mr Zafar.
When his pleas were ignored, Mr Zafar said, “PTI would not become part of this unconstitutional process”.
Another PTI Senator, Mohsin Aziz, also followed suit and said that the elections would “leave a scar on the people of KP” and urged the chair to adjourn the session.
He termed the electoral exercise in the absence of 11 senators as unconstitutional and advised the ruling coalition “to choose between the interest of the state and politics”.
Interpretation of ‘duly constituted’
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar rejected PTI’s assertions and read out Article 60 of the Constitution, which stated: “After the Senate has been duly constituted, it shall, at its first meeting and to the exclusion of any other business, elect from amongst its members a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman and, so often as the Office of Chairman or Deputy Chairman becomes vacant, the Senate shall elect another member as Chairman or, as the case may be, Deputy Chairman.”
He reasoned that the Senate came into existence after the Constitution of 1973 was framed.
He claimed that the word “duly constituted” in the first part of Article 60 was used for the first Senate election and in the context of “building the house” since it was a new body.
According to Mr Tarar, the second part of the article makes no mention of the word “duly constituted” and thus, this condition did not apply at the moment.
The minister also referred to Article 53 of the Constitution, which outlines the procedure for the election of National Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
“The word duly constituted is not used here since the National Assembly already existed when the Constitution was framed.”
The law minister then blamed PTI’s government in KP for the postponement of Senate elections in the province.
The elections were not postponed due to some natural disaster like flood but the ECP “was forced” to do so because the KP Assembly speaker did not administer oaths to the members elected on reserved seats despite a court order, the law minister added.
Mr Tarar also cited Article 67, which stated that proceedings “shall not be invalid on the ground that some persons who were not entitled to do so sat, voted or otherwise took part in the proceedings”.
“The house is complete for constitutional purposes,” he said and requested the presiding officer to proceed further.
After the law minister’s speech, the presiding officer overruled the PTI objections and continued with the election process.
‘PTI treading on path of chaos’
Later, while talking to the media outside the Parliament House, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif accused PTI of “treading on the path of chaos” and inciting the politics of denial, violence and hatred, according to APP.
He criticised the party for boycotting the election process and said dialogue and reconciliation should take place between political parties to resolve issues instead of contestation.
“PTI wanted to take the path of confrontation and we will not be an accomplice in chaos and violence,” the minister said.

1,Most of Muslim world to celebrate Eid together,"Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Indonesia among several countries observing Eidul Fitr today.","

• Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Indonesia among several countries observing Eidul Fitr today
• Shawwal moon not sighted in India and Bangladesh, which will mark festival tomorrow
ISLAMABAD: The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee on Tuesday announced that the whole nation will unanimously celebrate Eidul Fitr today (Wednesday) following the receipt of moon-sighting testimonies from various parts of the country.
The decision came despite initial reports of no Shawwal moon sightings by several zonal committees. The committees in Karachi and Lahore announced at around 7:30pm on Tuesday that there was no evidence of moon sightings in their regions.
With the announcement, Pakistan has joined several countries across the world in celebrating Eidul Fitr on Wednesday.
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Turkiye, Indonesia and Australia are some of the countries that are celebrating Eid today. However, the moon was not sighted in India and Bangladesh, which will observe the festival on Thursday.
The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee convened at the Federal Secretariat’s Kohsar Block in Islamabad, with Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad presiding over the meeting.
The gathering saw participation from committee members, primarily clerics representing major Islamic schools of thought — Shia, Barelvi, Deobandi and Ahle Hadis — alongside officials and technical experts from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Suparco, and the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Maulana Azad, addressing the media after the meeting, shared that credible evidence of the moon being sighted in major parts of the country, including the erstwhile Fata and the Gilgit-Baltistan, led to the collective decision to mark Eidul Fitr the following day.
“Eidul Fitr will be celebrated tomorrow,” he announced and prayed for the welfare of the country and the whole ummah.
He said the Shawwal moon was sighted in Karachi, Dir, Mohmand Agency, Faisalabad, Skardu and other areas. “We all congratulate the nation on this occasion,” he said, adding that this was also message of unity to the Islamic world due to Eid falling on the same day in most Muslim nations.
Maulana Azad stressed the need for all sections of society to move forward together for the sake of the country and paid tribute to the sacrifices rendered by armed forces to ensure peace in the country.
Zonal committees
Earlier, Maulana Muhammad Ahmed Salfi, head of the zonal Ruet-i-Hilal committee in Karachi, announced at around 7:30pm that there was no evidence of moon sighting in the city.
He said the Met Office had briefed the committee that a new moon was easily visible if its age was around 23 hours, whereas the moon on Tuesday had the age of 20 hours and it was difficult to view. “We have conveyed our findings to the central committee in Islamabad,” Maulana Salfi said.
However, he was confronted by the media persons who claimed that they themselves had seen the crescent through the official telescope installed at the roof of the Met Office building in Karachi. “I cannot speak on behalf of the media or anybody else,” Maulana Salfi responded.
A similar situation was faced by the zonal committee in Lahore, which also announced at around 7:30pm moon was not sighted.
However, the head of the zonal Ruet-i-Hilal committee in Peshawar, Prof Abdul Ghafoor, announced that 64 testimonies had been received and the information was forwarded to the central committee in Islamabad after verification in accordance with the prescribed criteria.
Meanwhile, the Dawoodi Bohra community celebrated Eidul Fitr across the country on Tuesday, as per the Fatimid calendar.

2,Internet ‘back’ after service disruptions countrywide,"KARACHI: Internet ser­vices were restored after brief disruptions in parts of the country on Tu­e­sday, Dawn.com...","KARACHI: Internet ser­vices were restored after brief disruptions in parts of the country on Tu­e­sday, Dawn.com reported.
According to Downdet­e­c­tor, which tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources, users reported issues with the services of three internet service providers — Pakis­tan Teleco­m­munica­tion Com­­pany Ltd (PTCL), Tra­nsworld Home, and Nayatel — shortly after noon.
Around 4pm, the internet tracker showed that user reports indicated no current problems with the latter two and possible problems with PTCL.
Internet monitor Netbl­ocks also reported the disruption followed by the recovery. It said operators had attributed the disturbance to a “technical issue”.
For PTCL, users had reported a disruption in services primarily from Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. For Trans­world Home, issues were earlier reported from Lahore, Karachi, Rawal­pindi and Peshawar.
For Nayatel, users had reported issues from Rawalpindi, Lahore and near Okara.
In an email to customers, seen by Dawn.com, Transworld Home said that there was an “unexpected nationwide outage affecting internet services in Pakistan”.
Today’s disruption came as access to social media platform X has been large­­ly disrupted in the country since February 17, after former commissioner Rawal­­­pindi Liaquat Ali Chatta made a statement in front of the media claiming that the “elections were rigged”.

3,"Amid schools’ expansion, govt to declare education emergency",PM Shehbaz vows to provide free education to children of poor and deserving families by establishing Daanish schools.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday announced that the federal government would declare an education emergency in the country and would provide all possible reso­urces to educate children of poor families.
He vowed to replicate his idea of free education to children of poor and deserving families by establishing Daanish Schools in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and remote areas of Balochistan and Sindh to fulfill the aspiration of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
“This is not the fault of the poor children if their parents cannot afford to provide top quality education to their children despite working hard…If iron gates of the Aitchison College or Grammar School are obstructing their way (to top quality education), the door of Daanish Schools are open for them,” the prime minister said.
He expressed these views while speaking at a ceremony, organised for the inspection of a site for the Daanish School being established in the Kuri area of the federal capital.

Malala urges PM Shehbaz to increase budget for education to 4pc of GDP

To be established over 30 acres of land, the sch­ool will provide free education and accommodat­ion to the children of people of low-income groups from the capital city and its suburbs. The school will be built in Kurri area at an estimated cost of over Rs5 billion.
Calling the alarming figure of 26 million out-of-school children a “cri­minal negligence”, the prime minister said that Quaid-i-Azam’s dream about Pakistan would remain unfulfilled without making arrangements and ensuring top quality education for the children of the poor people of the country.
“There can be no bigger national service or the fulfillment of the responsibility than enrolling these out-of-school children into schools,” Mr Shehbaz said, adding that the federal government would bear all expenses of constructing Daanish Schools in AJK, the GB and remote areas of Balochistan and Sindh.
The prime minister told the gathering of federal ministers, bureaucrats, heads of international institutions, educationists and students that Daanish School project was initiated under PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s vision.
Recounting the journey of the project, the prime minister said the PML-N had to face a lot of criticism for launching this initiative to support the children of the people belonging to low-income groups, but it remained steadfast in its commitment to ensure top-quality education for the children of the people of low-income group.
He also recalled that under Nawaz Sharif’s leadership, the PML-N government gave away laptops to students in the past which became an earning tool for them. Besides, he said, the then Punjab government also recruited around 200,000 teachers purely on merit.
He said the groundbreaking of Islamabad’s Daanish School would be performed soon and asked the education ministry to ensure the project’s completion within six to eight months. He also announced that he would personally inaugurate Daanish schools to be established in AJK, GB, Balochistan and Sindh.
Malala for bigger budget allocation
Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and education activist Malala Yousafzai on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to increase expenditure on education up to four per cent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
In a letter written to the premier, Ms Malala said Pakistan was spending less than 2 per cent of its GDP on education and she wanted it to reach and surpass 4pc of the GDP.
“Our work with the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training has allowed us to reach more than 4,500 high schools, engaging directly with nearly 500,000 girls through our STEAM partnership. We also support civil society and education experts in their efforts to improve teaching practices, digital education, and girls’ leadership development,” she said.
The Malala Foundation had given Pakistan $15 million for the promotion of education in Pakistan, Ms Yousafzai wrote, requesting the new government to focus more on girls’ education. “
As you develop your first 100-day plan, I look forward to working with your government to elevate girls’ education as a priority. I assure you that my team in Pakistan and our grantees are working diligently with your federal and provincial governments, as well as other development partners, to advance our shared goals as rapidly and effectively as possible,“ she wrote.

4,Syedaal Khan Nasar — from student leader to upper house,Political observers believe elevation of a Balochistan-based senator to deputy chairman’s post is a “major shift” in the politics of PML-N.,"QUETTA: PML-N Sena­tor Syedaal Khan Nasar comes from a rich political and tribal background, but in contrast with his father Rehman Khan Nasar — a diehard supporter of Pashtun anti-colonial leader Bacha Khan who spent 15 years in exile in Afghanistan — he chose to pursue his political career on the platform a right-wing party i.e. the PML-N.
Senator Nasar born on April 17, 1975, and started his political journey by joi­ning the Pashtun Stud­ent Federation (PSF), but soon he found himself aloof from the left-wing politics and joined the Muslim Stu­dent Federation — a student wing of the PML-N.
After obtaining an FSc degree from the government science college in Quetta, the senator enrolled in the Balochistan University as a private candidate. As student leader, he remained the central secretary general of the MSF from 1996 to 1999 and later became the president of the Muslim Youth Wing from 1999 to 2002.
The PML-N central leadership inducted him into the parent party and appointed him as the provincial additional general secretary of the PML-N Balochistan and also made him a member of the central working committee of the party.
Syedaal Khan Nasar was amongst those PML-N leaders who remained loyal — despite repercussions — to Nawaz Sharif during the Musharraf regime when the PML-N chief had gone into exile in Saudi Arabia and his party crumbled in his absence. Senator Nasar refused the offers to join the PML-Q, which was brought into power by General Musharraf.
He served the party as the senior vice president of PML-N Balochistan from 2013 to 2018 and also as provincial general secretary from 2018 to 2020. He also served as a political adviser to former Balochistan CM Nawab Sanaullah Zehri in the PML-N coalition government in Balochistan.
In the 2018 elections, the PML-N became almost dormant after the departure of key leaders but Syedaal Nasar was among those who remained loyal to the party.
After Nawaz Sharif returned from London, a large number of electables who had left the party came back during the visit of the PML-N supreme leader to Quetta.
These leaders were later awarded party tickets for the national and provincial assembly seats in Balochistan. When Syedaal Khan Nasar did not get the ticket, everyone was astonished.
Subsequently, the applications for the Senate election were invited and many former senators and tycoons, including Mr Nasar, applied for the ticket. However, Senator Nasar got the ticket and after the initial rejection of nomination papers, the PML-N leader made it to the upper house after an election tribunal allowed him to contest the election.
Political observers believe the elevation of a Balochistan-based senator to the deputy chairman’s post is a “major shift” in the politics of the PML-N. The party picked Senator Nasar despite the presence of tycoons and other bigwigs.
“I am very thankful to the party’s supreme leader Main Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who considered me for the slot of Deputy Chairman Senate,” Syedaal Khan told Dawn, adding that Pervaiz Rashid, Saad Rafique, and Azam Nazeer Tarar were also his supporters.

5,Situationer: How ‘difficult cases’ can shape CJP Isa’s legacy,"Although top judge has many detractors, his penchant for picking up threads of ‘unfinished judicial business’ has won him many admirers.","SEVEN months into his term, the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa has already started to shake things up in an attempt to shake the ghosts of the past, when the judiciary appeared reluctant to carry out accountability or introspection.
Not only did he bring back full court meetings, but the chief judge also agreed to dilute his powers as the CJP under the Practice and Procedure Act 2023, which was suspended by his predecessor Umar Ata Bandial, who termed the law “interference in court affairs”.
 
 

In the words of senior lawyer Akram Sheikh, an era of transparency and openness was ushered in when CJP Isa took oath of office in Sept last year.
“Qazi sahib has pioneered a new era in our superior judiciary and can be rightly termed as having brought revolutionary changes in [the] running of the highest court,” he said, adding that CJP Isa took oath on Sunday, and the first thing he did was to convene a meeting of the full court.

Although the top judge has many detractors, his penchant for picking up threads of ‘unfinished judicial business’, such as the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case, has won him many unlikely admirers

On the same day, he decided to take up a case about the Practice and Procedure Act, filed months before he took charge.
The chief judge also formed a committee of three senior judges for the constitution of benches under Article 184(3), a power earlier held by the ‘master of roster’, i.e. the chief justice.
Mr Sheikh hoped that CJP Isa would be able to turn the court into an “actually final but satisfactory resort for consumers of justice”.
Former additional attorney general (AAG) Tariq Mehmood Khokhar agreed. He said CJP Isa inherited an institution with deepening fissures and lacking the power to effect elections under the Constitution, but he proved to be instrumental in plugging institutional fissures and holding general elections.
Adherence to Constitution
At the very outset, Justice Isa seemed to make it clear that the court would concern itself with the obligations enshrined in the Con­stitution and all judgements would emanate from that document.
This meant that the court would not overstep its bounds, as seen in the past, nor let anyone else do so.
To back up this commitment, the CJP took up two cases: the general elections case and the Musharraf case.
While he remained steadfast in his desire not to let the government delay elections any further than they already had been, a landmark verdict on Jan 10, 2024 upheld the death penalty awarded to late military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf.
 
 

In another daring move before taking office, Justice Isa attended a session of the National Assembly on the golden jubilee of the Constitution. He later shrugged off clamour on social media by saying that the occasion was one of celebration for all citizens, and not the exclusive domain of any particular political party or institution.
ZAB reference
Another achievement of the Isa-led court is the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto reference, which took over a decade to decide. During a visit to a court reporters’ event last year when he was still the senior puisne judge, a journalist had quipped that “whenever we talk of the rule of law, we are faced with a paradox that the one who framed the 1973 Constitution, still awaits justice”.
The journalist was referring to the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on April 4, 1979, as the presidential reference seeking an opinion on revisiting the death sentence in the case was still pending while the country was celebrating the golden jubilee of the 1973 Constitution.
Soon after assuming the top office, CJP Isa not only fixed the reference for hearing, but had also decided the same on March 6, by admitting that fair trial and due process to Bhutto was denied by the Lahore High Court (LHC) and then appellate court’s final endorsement.
 
 

The reference was filed in April 2011 and heard last time in Jan 2012 by then Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. After that, it was not taken up by successive CJPs for 12 years.
“You need a considerable moral courage to accept the grave injustice done to the then Prime Minister by none other than the top judiciary itself,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity.
The other achievements of the top judge include live streaming of court proceedings, reversal of lifetime disqualification for elected representatives, accountability of a brother judge (Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi), and relief to ex-IHC judge Shaukat Siddiqui, who was sacked for claiming the involvement of the ISI in the court affairs.
 
 

This last decision also proved to be a catalyst for others to come forward with their gripes, as six judges of the Islamabad High Court — finding solace in the top court’s exoneration of their former colleague — found the courage to raise some uncomfortable issues before the Supreme Judicial Council.
Faults
But the top judge is not without his detractors. The PTI election symbol case, choosing returning officers (ROs) from the executive, loss of reserved seats for PTI, JIT notices to journalists and interim orders in the military courts have enraged many, said Mr Khokhar, the former additional attorney general.
He added that the timing was not propitious for the CJP, and a social media campaign against him only added to it.
Mr Sheikh, the seasoned lawyer, said the CJP did earn a “negative perception” for deciding political cases, but overall “he can rightly claim to his credit the drastic changes he introduced” as the top judge. The lawyer said that through a live telecast of trials, he turned the closed-door Supreme Court into an open, transparent, and dynamic institution.
After becoming the CJP, Justice Isa also appointed the SC’s first-ever woman registrar, Jazeela Aslam, who was a district and sessions judge in Okara. His decision to invite his spouse Sarina Isa to stand next to him during the oath-taking ceremony also speaks for his progressive credentials.
Perceived as an upright judge, the top adjudicator is certainly not without his faults. He is also routinely subjected to intense criticism for his straightforward, and often condescending approach and penchant for observations. But even his detractors accept openly that one “needs extreme courage to build such a legacy”.
