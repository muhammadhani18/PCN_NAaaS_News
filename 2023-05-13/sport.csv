LONDON: Having seen his side salvage a 1-1 draw at home against Sevilla in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday thanks to Federico Gatti’s header in the 97th minute, Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri was looking forward to next week’s return in Spain.
Europa League kings Sevilla ignored the heavy rain and the pressure of the Italian crowd at a packed Allianz Stadium with Moroccan international En-Nesyri finishing a sharp counter-attack in the 26th minute to break the deadlock in Turin.
Jose Luis Mendilibar’s side deserved their lead at the break and although Juve improved, the Andalucians shut them out well in their bid for a record-extending seventh title before Gatti’s last-gasp effort left the tie evenly poised.
“On the counter-attack we were caught out because we didn’t track back and left gaps,” Allegri told reporters after the match. “We made some wrong choices up front and Sevilla knew how to stand against us tonight with a good mentality.
“It was good that we held-on for some time and didn’t end up 2-0 down. [We] did well to fight back and get a deserved draw which leaves everything to play for in the second leg. Now in Seville there is a chance to get a result.”
Juve’s draw keeps up hopes of an all-Italian final in Budapest on May 31 after Edoardo Bove fired AS Roma to a 1-0 home win over Bayer Leverkusen in the other semi-final first leg.
Roma youth product Bove stabbed in the winner on the rebound in the 63rd minute, allowing Jose Mourinho’s side to take a slender lead into next week’s second leg in Germany.
The win gives Mourinho the chance to reach his second Euro­pean final in as many years as Roma coach after winning the Europa Conference League last season.
“It’s all down to the boys tonight who played with desire and the right mentality,” Mourinho said. “I have put in a lot of miles over the course of my career but even I really felt the support of the fans tonight and the boys responded with the desire to make them happy.”
In the third-tier Conference League, West Ham United moved a step closer to a first European final for 47 years after they came surging back with goals from Said Benrahma and Michail Antonio to beat AZ Alkmaar of the Netherlands 2-1 in their semi-final first leg.
While West Ham eye a landmark final appearance, FC Basel are chasing history of their own after seizing control of the other semi-final with a dramatic 2-1 victory against Fiorentina.
GATTI’S LAST-GASP HEADER 
Sevilla, who dumped Manchester United out in the quarter-finals, have never been knocked out of Europa League in the semi-final stage and the Spaniards, who won the tournament at the Juventus Stadium in 2014, made themselves at home in the first half.
Lucas Ocampos missed a sitter for the visitors but En-Nesyri scored with a tidy finish from close range after a quick counter-attack led by Ocampos.

The Andalucians then shut out Juve well in their bid to take their advantage back to the rowdy Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan next Thursday but Gatti nodded home from point blank range after substitute Paul Pogba headed the ball back into his path from a corner.
“It’s a shame, given the game that we played, that they levelled in the last play of the match, but it is what it is,” said Mendilibar. “We stopped Juventus in every moment and we played well at times too, we have to think about that, not the last moment of the game.
“It’s a pity, the referee let play go on and we didn’t know how to defend the move. Sometimes it goes for you, sometimes against you. If we had defended well, then nothing would have happened.”
BOVE HANDS NARROW LEAD 
Roma took the win despite having a host of players either out or barely fit to play, with 20-year-old Bove scoring his first Euro­pean goal to cause an eruption in the stands which up to that point had looked almost impossible.
Bove started the move which led to the goal, charging forward before feeding Tammy Abraham whose spin and shot led to the ball falling to the young midfielder, who lashed in the opener.
“I’m especially happy with the result,” Bove said.  “It was essential to win this first half and go there on Thursday with the same desire. “Today we put great intensity into our game and we are happy. At first they made it difficult for us and it took us a while to adjust but then we controlled the game very well.”
It means Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen, who have not made a European final since their 2002 appearance in the Champions League showpiece, have work to do next week.
“Roma were a bit more dangerous in the second half, but we had the feeling that we could beat them in their own backyard,” said Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. “It’s not the best result for us but it could have been worse.”
WEST HAM, BASEL TAKE CONTROL 
David Moyes’ West Ham are in a strong position to reach the Conference League final in Prague on June 7 as they head to the AZ Stadium in Alkmaar for the return leg next Thursday.
Benrahma equalised with a 67th-minute penalty and Antonio poached the winner nine minutes later after Tijani Reijnders had thrashed home a long-range effort to give the Dutch visitors a shock 41st-minute lead at the London Stadium.
“It was a strange game to analyse. AZ played well in the build-up. We were a bit harum-scarum. We made some stupid decisions, shooting from 30 yards and not taking chances. But in the end, I’m happy with the result,” Moyes said.
A stoppage-time goal from Zeki Amdouni earned Basel victory at Fiorentina and the Swiss Super League side are now in a solid position to become the first team from their country to reach a European final.
Arthur Cabral headed Fiorentina into the lead after 25 minutes at the Stadio Artemio Franchi but Andy Diouf equalised after 71 minutes before Darian Males teed up Zeki Amdouni for a predatory finish three minutes into added time.

2,No prison for key witness in FIFA corruption probe,NEW YORK: A former Argentine businessman who pleaded guilty in the sprawling FIFA corruption probe will not have to...,"NEW YORK: A former Argentine businessman who pleaded guilty in the sprawling FIFA corruption probe will not have to spend time in prison, after his testimony contributed to the US convictions of South American football officials and a television executive.
Alejandro Burzaco, the former head of Argentine sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias, was sentenced to time served on Friday by US Dis­trict Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn federal court.
No fine was imposed. The defendant previously forfeited about $21.7 million.
Burzaco, 58, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to three counts of racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
He admitted to paying bribes and kickbacks to officials at world football governing body FIFA and regional affiliates for marketing rights to tournaments including the World Cup and Copa America.
Burzaco also said Qatar bribed FIFA officials to host the 2022 World Cup, which the Middle Eastern country denies.
“We’re thrilled” with the sentence, Burzaco’s lawyer Jim Walden said in an interview.  “Alejandro and his family are grateful to Judge Chen for her compassion and wisdom.”
Prosecutors did not recommend a specific 
sentence for Burzaco. A spokesman for US Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn had no additional comment.

3,Pakistan to face India in three title contests at BFAME Bridge,LAHORE: Pakistan set up title clashes with India in three out of four categories at the BFAME Bridge Championships ...,"LAHORE: Pakistan set up title clashes with India in three out of four categories at the BFAME Bridge Championships on Friday with the latter having a chance to sweep all the title on offer.
The arch-rivals will contest finals of the Open Team, Women’s Team and Seniors Team events on Saturday while India face the United Arab Emirates in the final of the Mixed Team as well.
Pakistan held a narrow lead over the UAE in their semi-final of the Open Team on Thursday but wrapped up the contest convincingly with a margin of 164.34 points to 140.64 on Friday morning with India overpowering Bangladesh in the other last-four contest 163.40 to 143.79.
Pakistan came from behind to down UAE 170.77 to 151.59 in the Women’s Team semi-final, having trailed their opponents 80.5 to 121 at the start of the day, while India (63.5) and Pakistan (41.0) finished top two in the Seniors Team event.
With the top two teams in each event advancing to the World Cup in Morocco later this year, Pakistan’s successes on Friday meant they secured qualification in three categories.

4,Bais wins stage seven of Giro after gruelling climb,GRAN SASSO D’ITALIA: Davide Bais of Eolo-Kometa won a gruelling stage seven of the Giro d’Italia on Friday after...,"GRAN SASSO D’ITALIA: Davide Bais of Eolo-Kometa won a gruelling stage seven of the Giro d’Italia on Friday after leading a three-man breakaway, beating Karel Vacek and Simone Petilli to the finish line for the first victory of his career.
The seventh stage was one for the climbers on a 218-km ride from Capua to Gran Sasso d’Italia which involved flat roads at the start before the final climb of approximately 45 km — a total altitude gain of 3,900 metres.
The breakaway trio of Bais, Petilli and Vacek were seven-and-a-half minutes ahead of the peloton with 20 km to go and they showed no signs of slowing down as the rest of the group played catch-up.
As they pedalled up an unrelenting climb through snow-banked roads, Czech rider Vacek fell away and looked like he was out of the contest before he put his head down and caught up with the two Italians again in the final two kilometres.
As they waited for each other to take charge in the final kilometre, it was 25-year-old Bais who dropped his rivals and sprinted ahead in the last 200 metres to take victory with Vacek second and Petilli third after they ran out of steam.

5,World sport returns to China after years of Covid cancellations,"SHANGHAI: China will next week host its first major international sports event since abandoning strict Covid rules,...","SHANGHAI: China will next week host its first major international sports event since abandoning strict Covid rules, heralding the return of elite competition to the country after more than three years.
With the exception of last year’s Beijing Winter Olympics, which took place in a  “bubble”, almost all global sport ground to a halt in China after the pandemic emerged there in late 2019.
But China abruptly lifted its  “zero-Covid” policy in December and world sport organisations will be eager to relaunch lucrative tournaments in the world’s second-largest economy.
The Sudirman Cup team event, one of the biggest tournaments in the badminton calendar, begins on Sunday in Suzhou, near Shanghai.
Women’s WTA and men’s ATP tennis makes a full-throttle return to China later this year while the Asian Games in Hangzhou — postponed from last year — will take place in the autumn.
Defending champions China are the most successful team in Sudirman Cup history, having won the biennial tournament 12 times.
Major athletics and snooker competitions are also scheduled, although Shanghai’s Formula One Grand Prix will not take place until next year. Golf is another set to return.
“The pandemic years have not been easy for any of us,” Badminton World Federation president Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen said, calling the return a  “significant moment”.
“China has such a vibrant association with badminton that it still feels odd that we’ve missed out on Chinese tournament hosting for so many months,” Hoyer-Larsen added.
At this year’s Sudirman Cup the stakes are even higher because it will count towards qualification for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
Tennis is returning to China in a big way from September.
On Monday the ATP hailed the beginning of a  “new era” as it launched an expanded Shanghai Masters, boosting the prize money to make it the richest sports event in Asia.
Women’s tennis will also return to the country after Covid and having abandoned a boycott over concerns about the safety of Chinese player Peng Shuai.
Domestic sports competitions mostly continued through the worst of Covid in China.

6,Former captain Sammy takes over as West Indies white-ball coach,"“It will be a challenge but one that I’m ready for and excited about,"" says Sammy.","ST. JOHN’S: Daren Sammy, the only man to lead his side to two T20 World Cup titles, was on Friday appointed the new head coach of West Indies’ white ball teams, the country’s cricket board (CWI) announced. 
The 39-year-old from St Lucia captained West Indies to victory over Sri Lanka in the 2012 T20 World Cup final and again in 2016 when they beat England in a dramatic decider. 
Within months of the second triumph Sammy, who skippered West Indies in all three formats of the game, was removed as captain but went on to play franchise white ball cricket around the world. 
Since retiring as a player, Sammy has coached teams in the Pakistan Super League and the Caribbean Premier League. 
His first job will be a three-match ODI series against UAE in Sharjah next month, ahead of the the World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe. 
West Indies failed to qualify automatically and will now take part in the 10-team tournament to try and take one of the two remaining slots in the main event which will take place in India later in the year. 
“It will be a challenge but one that I’m ready for and excited about. I’m really looking forward to the opportunity, especially looking at the players we have and the impact that I believe I can have in the dressing room,” Sammy said. 
“When I look around there is an abundance of talent. And what I saw in South Africa in the white ball matches under new captains Shai Hope and Rovman Powell and the leadership provided by Andre Coley, there is great belief that we can do well. 
“I believe I will bring the same approach as I had as a player - the passion, the desire for success, and my undying love for West Indies cricket.”  
Cricket West Indies, who decided in March to engage separate coaches for the limited over and Test teams, also appointed former Jamaica wicketkeeper/batsman Coley as the new head coach of the Test side. 
“I am looking forward to the challenges ahead, as well as the opportunities as we sharpen our focus on moving up the test rankings, and qualifying for the World Test Championship final in June 2025,” Coley said. 
Coley, 48, was interim head coach of the red ball side when West Indies toured Zimbabwe and South Africa earlier this year. He will also coach the West Indies A team. 
“They are well equipped for their roles, and we are confident they will bring different perspectives, skills and real passion to the West Indies dressing room,” said Johnny Grave, CEO of CWI. 
“The introduction of separate coaches signals the start of a new approach for the West Indies men’s teams. We know it will enable greater focus on player communication, team planning and preparation to the benefit of our players and West Indies cricket.”
PAUL AND MOTIE RECALLED FOR WORLD CUP QUALIFIERS
On Thursday, West Indies recalled all-rounder Keemo Paul and left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie for the World Cup qualifiers.
New ODI skipper Sai Hope will be able to call on Paul and Motie for the first time since last July’s ODI series against India in Trinidad.
Lead selector, former test opener Desmond Haynes, said he had high hopes for the returning pair. 
“Paul is a three-dimensional player, who can bowl the new ball effectively, he’s dynamic in the outfield and he can also make vital runs. He is now fully recovered from injury and with his skill-set we see him as a potential match-winner for us,” he said. 
“Motie was excellent in the Test matches in the Zimbabwe earlier this year, where he took 19 wickets, and we anticipate similar conditions for the qualifiers. We believe he will again relish the chance to bowl in those conditions,” he added.
The main omission from the squad is Guyanese batsman and T20 star Shimron Hetmyer who was dropped from the World Cup squad last year after a dispute over flights shortly before the tournament.
Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Ireland and the Nether­lands are the main rivals for West Indies in the battle for qualification for the main tournament.
Nepal, Oman, Scotland, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are also competing for a chance to make it to India.
West Indies will play three ODI warm-ups against the United Arab Emirates without players performing in the Indian Premier League, who have been allowed rest time in the Caribbean before heading to Zimbabwe.
Squad: Shai Hope (captain), Rovman Powell (vice captain), Shamarh Brooks, Yannic Cariah, Keacy Carty, Roston Chase, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Gudakesh Motie, Keemo Paul, Nicholas Pooran, Romario Shepherd.

7,"PFF election process  to begin within days, says NC","“We want free and fair elections to witness the genuine selection of a body that will effectively oversee the PFF affairs,” NC says.","KARACHI: From months, it is now down to days. At long last, the Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Committee has announced the election process of the country’s crisis-riddled football governing body is set to begin.
The mandate given to the Haroon Malik-led PFF NC by FIFA is due to expire at the end of next month with Friday’s announcement suggesting that it will receive an extension to complete the process.
The NC, which was appointed in September 2019 after years of crisis and controversy in the PFF, had been under fire from football officials as well as the government for its failure to begin the election process — the main part of its mandate.
A meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee was due to be held on Wednesday where it was due to take action against the PFF NC for the delay in elections but it was postponed to May 17 due to the law and order situation in the country.
In March, PFF NC chief Haroon had told a news conference, sitting alongside Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination Ehsan ur Rehman Mazari, that the election process would begin after Eid-ul-Fitr.
“Following persistent efforts by the NC, the election process is set to commence within a matter of days,” a PFF NC news release said.
The NC has also been accused of partiality towards one of the factions vying for power and Haroon stressed that the NC has “no favourites”.
“We want free and fair elections to witness the genuine selection of a body that will effectively oversee the PFF affairs,” he was quoted as saying.
The election process is due to begin with the club scrutiny to finalise the voter list for the district elections with the PFF NC stating that the data collected through the Pakistan Football Connect platform being analysed at the moment.
The districts will then elect the provincial associations, nominees from which form the PFF Congress which elects the president.
In the news release, the PFF NC blamed the court cases against the country’s football governing body as well as the 15-month ban on Pakistan by FIFA, which was lifted in June last year, as the reason for the delay in starting the election process.
“Reflecting on the challenging journey of the NC, Haroon Malik ... acknowledged the numerous crises and controversies, including ongoing court cases that have plagued the committee since July 2022,” the news release added.
“However, he expressed gratitude for FIFA’s unwavering support, as they have pledged their full backing to the NC’s pursuit of holding elections and stressed the utmost importance of upholding the Constitution.”

ROME: Iga Swiatek started her bid to win her third straight Italian Open title in perfect fashion on Friday, not dropping a game in her straight-sets thrashing of Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. 
World number one Swiatek looked in exceptional form as she demolished Pavlyuchenkova 6-0, 6-0 in just over an hour to ease her way into the third round in Rome. 
Losing finalist in Madrid last weekend, Swiatek looked in great form in the tournament she won last year before going on to blitz the French Open even though she is still shaking off a rib injury suffered at Indian Wells. 
“I still may feel some discomfort, but it is really, really low. Even when I withdrew from Miami, the pain was low. It was just the risk of getting it worse that stopped me,” Swiatek told reporters. “I wouldn’t say my physicality is stopping me. I came back quickly and I kind of missed only one tournament. I think overall it’s pretty positive.” 
Swiatek now faces either Bernarda Pera or Lesia Tsurenko in the last 32 after extending her winning streak in the Italian capital to 12 matches. 
The only real resistance from Pavlyuchenkova, who reached the final of  Roland Garros two years ago, came in the final game of the first set,  when she saved six set points from 0-40 down on her serve. 
Swiatek eventually came through that game and swept Pavlyuchenkova  aside in the second set, finishing the job against the serve with her  first match point. 
Fourth seed Ons Jabeur fell 6-1, 6-4 to Paula Badosa, last year’s finalist being eliminated in her first match to leave the women’s tournament without another big name. 
Jabeur joins world number two Aryna Sabalenka, third-ranked Jessica Pegula and 2019 winner Karolina Pliskova in being dumped out in the second round. 
The 28-year-old has had calf problems in recent weeks, an injury which caused her to retire in the semi-finals at Stuttgart and not defend her Madrid title. 
Badosa will face world number 27 Marta Kostyuk in the third round. Ninth-seeded Maria Sakkari beat Barbora Strycova 6-1, 6-3. 
Earlier, Jannick Sinner cruised into the men’s last 32 with a straight-sets win over Thanasi Kokkinakis, 6-1, 6-4. 
World number eight Sinner took one hour, 18 minutes to deal with Australian qualifier Kokkinakis, and will now play Russian Alexander Shevchenko, who beat Argentinian Sebastian Baez 6-3, 6-4. 
“I’m happy with my level today, it was not easy, it was a little bit breezy, a bit windy,” Sinner said on court. “Especially in the second set he played a little bit better. I also  had a couple of chances which I didn’t use but very happy about how I  served, I struck the ball very well.” 
Cameron Norrie strolled past French qualifier Alexandre Muller 6-2, 6-3 to set up a clash with Marton Fucsovics in the next round after the Hungarian beat Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-4. 
Also on the red clay courts, Australian qualifier Alexei Popyrin wore down Felix Auger-Aliassime over more than three hours for a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 victory — leaving the 10th-ranked Auger-Aliassime still without a win on clay this season. 
Francisco Cerundolo eliminated Wu Yibing 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 and Cameron Norrie defeated Alexandre Muller 6-2, 6-3. 
On Thursday night, Sabalenka suffered a shock as the in-form Belarusian crashed to a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 defeat by American Sofia Kenin in a high-octane second-round match. 
In another shock, Taylor Townsend, ranked a lowly 168, stunned Pegula 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 to also make the third round but world number four Caroline Garcia battled from a break down in the decider to beat unseeded Romanian Ana Bogdan 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.  
On the men’s side, Marco Cecchinato delighted fans at the Foro Italico with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Mackenzie McDonald and he plays Roberto Bautista Agut next.

10,City eye finish line as Liverpool chase top four spot,LONDON: Manchester City can take a giant stride towards a third consecutive Premier League title by beating Everton...,"LONDON: Manchester City can take a giant stride towards a third consecutive Premier League title by beating Everton this weekend but rejuvenated Arsenal have not given up hope of springing a surprise.
Liverpool are suddenly in the conversation for a top-four finish after six straight wins cranked up the pressure on Manchester United and Newcastle United.
At the bottom, Leeds United and Leicester City are in danger of being cut adrift, along with Southampton.
Leaders City are hot favourites to wrap up their fifth Premier League trophy in six seasons but face a potentially tricky trip to Everton on Sunday.
Sean Dyche’s side clawed their way out of the relegation zone with a confidence-boosting 5-1 win at Brighton & Hove Albion earlier this week.
Everton’s record against City is not pretty — their 1-1 draw in December, under former boss Frank Lampard, came after 10 consecutive defeats in all competitions.
The Merseyside club, just two points above the drop zone with three games to play, will be fighting for their lives.
Meanwhile, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has not given up on his title dream, saying  “the prize is there, not too far” after his side’s 2-0 win against Newcastle last week.
Arsenal, with three games left, can reach a maximum of 90 points if they beat Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers.
City, a point ahead of the Gunners with a game in hand, need nine points to guarantee the title, though their goal difference is significantly superior.
Pep Guardiola’s men have the trickier run-in, with matches against Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford to follow their trip to Goodison Park.
UNITED SEEK COMFORTS
In the weekend’s other match, Manchester United are back at Old Trafford on Saturday and in desperate need of a win against Wolves as they seek to hold off fast-charging Liverpool in the battle for a top-four finish.
Erik ten Hag’s men had one foot in next season’s Champions League before costly defeats against Brighton and West Ham United.
The Red Devils, who have four games left to play, have lost eight away matches in the Premier League this season, their joint-highest tally in a single campaign in the competition.
It is a different story at home, where they have won 12 and lost just once.
“We have everything in our hands,” said Ten Hag, whose side are a point clear of Liverpool with a game in hand.
The Dutchman knows his first season at the helm will ultimately be judged on whether United qualify for Europe’s elite club competition despite cup success.
Third-placed Newcastle also had a wobble last week, losing to Arsenal, and are just three points ahead of Jurgen Klopp’s men.
Elsewhere, Southampton are all but relegated and Leeds and Leicester are the bookies’ favourites to drop through the trap door along with them.
Sam Allardyce had a daunting first outing as boss of 19th-placed Leeds, losing 2-1 to title-chasing Manchester City last weekend.
The club are two points from safety and with matches to come against Newcastle, West Ham and Tottenham, few would give them much chance of survival.
England midfielder James Maddison said after this week’s 5-3 defeat to Fulham that Leicester, level with Leeds on 30 points, were still battling, even though games against Liverpool, Newcastle and West Ham look tough.
“It’s not down to attitude or application,” he tweeted.  “We will keep going until the very end.”

11,National Games torch set for host city Quetta after Lahore tour,LAHORE: The 34th National Games’ torch was handed over to the Sports Board Punjab (SBP) by the province’s ...,"LAHORE: The 34th National Games’ torch was handed over to the Sports Board Punjab (SBP) by the province’s Olympic association PbOA for its onward journey to Quetta, where the Games started with the hockey events on Friday.
The torch was first displayed at the Lahore College before being taken to the University for Women, Mayo Garden and the Punjab Stadium — where it was handed over to SBP secretary Shahid Zaman by Punjab Olympic Association president Amir Jan.
The torch was carried by renowned international athletes Shabana Akhtar, Shajar Abbas and World Cup winning Kabaddi player Shafiq Chishti.
The ceremony was wrapped up with the torch’s tour around the city on a Punjab Tourism Department bus, on which several athletes were boarded.
Speaking on the occasion, Shahid said “sport is the biggest medium to bring people belonging from different areas and culture together”. He hoped the National Games in Quetta “would serve the objective fully”.  
Pakistan Olympic Association secretary Khalid Mahmood expressed his happiness over the Balochistan government “overcoming all challenges effectively to hold the Games in a befitting manner”. He added the province’s administration was fully determined to organise the Games successfully.
Balochistan Sports Department secretary Ishaq Jamali echoed Khalid’s views, saying his team was looking forward to a successful Games “with
the cooperation of the POA (Pakistan Olympic Association), all national sports federations and the provincial sports departments”. 
Meanwhile, there were concerns about Punjab’s prospects in the upcoming Games with the PbOA receiving less funds than it had demanded from the provincial government — Rs 20 million instead of Rs 30 million.
Though the training camps for different disciplines were set up here, time is running short for Punjab’s athletes to prepare, 
with the participation of the contingent seeming just eyewash with no big hope for a good number of medals.
Moreover, the cycling and swimming events of the National Games will be held in Lahore. The cycling event starts May 14 at the country’s lone velodrome here.  
The swimming event will be held at the Punjab International Swimming Pool from May 25. The sailing and rowing will be held in Karachi.
