1,Rupee claws back two days of losses in big rally,Jumps 4.9pc to close at 285.08 versus dollar in interbank market; Remittances fall 13pc in the first 10 months (July to April) of the current fiscal year.,"KARACHI: A significant reco­v­ery of 4.86 per cent in the rup­ee’s value against the US dollar surprised the currency market and dealers on Friday, while it cost heavily to hoarders willing to earn more from a further dev­a­luation of the local currency.
The State Bank reported the dollar price at Rs285.08 in the interbank market on Friday against Rs298.93 a day earlier, noting the rupee appreciation by Rs13.85.
It was the highest single-day recovery in the rupee’s value in terms of absolute change. Earlier, the rupee appreciated by Rs9.60 on Aug 3, 2022, and by Rs6.60 on March 3 this year.
The open market reported the dollar price at Rs289 on Friday. Currency market experts said there was no shortage of dollars and the increased price of dollars in the open market only reflected the interbank rates.
A senior banker dealing with foreign currencies in the interbank market said that while Friday’s rally was remarkable, the sustainability of this rate was more important.

Jumps 4.9pc to close at 285.08 versus dollar in interbank market 

The rupee jumped after two days of major losses, falling from Rs284.87 to Rs290.22 on Wednesday, and then to 298.93 on Thursday. The currency recovered almost all of those losses on Friday.
“The dollar trading started with the Rs290 and kept moving around it, but the supply of dollars from a large bank has already slashed the demand,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market.
He said the increase in dollar rates in the previous two days was mainly due to a large buying by the National Bank of Pakistan for foreign payments, which created a shortage and led to panic buying.
Bankers said the dust had settled, and the dollar had retreated to its Wednesday position, whereas the State Bank’s tight control over the opening of letters of credit remained intact.
The controlled imports have not only supported the exchange rate to keep the dollar at Rs282-284 for more than a couple of weeks, but they also helped the country to post a current account surplus of $654 million in March. That was in sharp contrast to a deficit of $36m in February.
Currency experts said the current account surplus was a positive factor for the exchange rate despite no inflows from the International Monetary Fund as the government struggles to negotiate a deal with the lender.
Meanwhile, remittances sent by Pakistanis working abroad fell 13pc in the first 10 months (July to April) of the current fiscal year. Foreign direct investment also dropped 22.5pc year-on-year during the first nine months (July to March).

2,PM asked to implement cheaper energy projects,"Dastgir says ""approval of category-III projects will be a swift jump towards renewable energy”; 13 renewable ventures awaiting go-ahead since 2020.","ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel and federal ministers including Energy Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan are pushing for the implementation of about 680MW of 13 solar and wind power projects of category-III whose tariffs had been approved by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) in 2017-18 but not allowed to start work since then.
In three separate presentations to the prime minister, Mr Dastgir, Minister for Human Rights Riaz Hussain Pirzada and Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecom Kauda Babar said these projects were given all approvals including tariffs in a range of 3.2 to 3.7 cents per kWh in 2020 but were not allowed to proceed owing to changing government policies.
They argued that since a reference tariff approved by Nepra for a government-sponsored solar power block of 600MW at Muzaffargarh in Punjab was also in the same range and yet facing bidding and financial challenges, the private sector sponsors of 13 old projects in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan should be allowed to set up their plants to ensure cheaper and clean energy to the consumers.
They have complained that investments of over $600 million appeared to be facing bureaucratic resistance. Mr Dastgir wrote to the prime minister “Approval of category-III projects … will be a swift jump towards renewable energy”. 

13 renewable ventures of 680MW awaiting go-ahead since 2020

He added that a draft summary shared with the Prime Minister’s Office in October last year had proposed a way forward for approval from the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) to “allow genuinely qualified and capable projects to proceed apace, which will make it feasible for the prime minister to start laying their foundation stones before end of the current fiscal year”. The minister complained that ‘no comments and feed have been forthcoming’.
As a member of a committee of ministers on category-III stalled projects constituted by the prime minister in January this year, Minister for Human Rights Pirzada complained that the said committee had met only thrice in more than three months where the chief executive officer of Alternative Energy Development BoardAEDB/Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) had been unable to make any viable suggestions and was rather “dragging his foot in typical bureaucratic style”.
The cat-III projects, said Mr Pirzada, also included 680MW of 13 advanced-stage wind and solar projects, having completed all requisite milestones of letters of support (LOSs) as per the Alternative Energy Policy of 2006 and were awarded Nepra tariff in the range of 3.2 to 3.85 cents per unit, which is “lowest in the history of Pakistan” and should be allowed to move forward. 
He asked the prime minister not to allow his vision of collaborations with Turkey, China and other countries for investments in renewable energy projects to “fall victim in the hands of irresolute, myopic and indolent bureaucracy” which may seriously jeopardise Pakistan’s energy security in the coming years. This would be happening when China and India would be adding 500,000MW of renewable energy by 2030 but Pakistan would be standing at a pathetic 1,800MW of wind and 500MW of solar grid power in operations.
Mr Pirzada said the chief executive of AEDB/PPIB had mentioned bidding as a way forward but failed to provide any concrete timeline for bidding to the committee and it appeared it will take months before even the request for proposals for bidding could be advertised. 
In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Pirzada said Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar, another member of the committee, had also expressed his displeasure over the irresponsible attitude of the AEDB chief for providing incorrect information about 13 advanced stage projects.
The minister alleged that bidding for these projects had not been arranged over the past five years while public pressure was immense on the government for cheap wind and solar projects. He quoted the Nepra chairman as telling the committee all 13 wind and solar projects’ approved tariffs ranged between 3.2 to 3.7 cents per unit, which were the lowest in the history of Pakistan.

3,Lucky Core inches closer to Lotte Chemical acquisition,Lotte Chemical Company enjoys a captive market of sorts as the country’s only manufacturer and supplier of PTA.,"KARACHI: Lucky Core Industries Ltd (LCI) said on Friday it signed an “assignment and assumption agreement” with its wholly owned subsidiary as well as Lotte Chemical Corporation of South Korea (LCC) to complete the transaction involving the sale of Lotte Chemical Pakistan Ltd.
Earlier, LCI had signed a share purchase agreement with the South Korean firm for the acquisition of its 1.1 billion shares constituting 75.01 per cent stake in Lotte Chemical Pakistan.
Lucky Core Ventures Ltd, one of the three subsidiaries of LCI, will now be completing the transaction, it said.
Based on a Bloomberg story published in January this year that referred to the transaction value in the South Korean currency, analysts said at the time the deal was signed at Rs31.30 per share or $155.8 million.
Lotte Chemical Company makes purified terephthalic acid (PTA), which is a raw material for textile and packaging industries. The company enjoys a captive market of sorts as the country’s only manufacturer and supplier of PTA. Its entire output is consumed by the local textile and packaging industries.
Lucky Core Industries was known until recently as ICI Pakistan Ltd. Back in 2008, AkzoNobel, which is one of the largest coatings and chemicals companies globally, became the ultimate holding company of ICI Pakistan Ltd.
Lucky Holdings Ltd then acquired the majority shareholding from AkzoNobel in 2012 and became the ultimate holding company of ICI Pakistan Ltd.
It went on an acquisition spree in the following years and acquired assets in pharmaceutical, chemical and formula milk businesses. Its net profit for 2021-22 amounted to Rs8.86bn on a consolidated basis, up 69pc from a year ago. Its consolidated turnover increased 56pc to Rs100.86bn in the same year.

4,Short-term inflation stays above 48pc for second week in a row,"Slow recovery from flood-led damages caused the supply of essential crops to remain short of domestic requirements, finance ministry report says.","ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, based on the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), remained elevated at 48.02 per cent for the week ended on May 11, off­i­cial data showed on Friday.
The year-on-year rise remained above 48pc for the second consecutive week. The SPI rose by an all-time high of 48.35pc for the period ending on May 4. Wheat flour, sugar, meat, pulses and vegetables are getting costlier.
However, on a week-on-week basis, it posted a rise of 0.27pc.
The SPI has steadily been on the rise since the start of Ramazan due to continued rupee devaluation, costly petrol prices, increase in sales tax and higher electricity charges.
Of the 51 items in the SPI basket, prices of 23 goods soared, seven dropped and 21 remained unchanged compared to the previous week.
During the week under review, the items whose pri­ces increased the most over the same week a year ago were: potatoes (112.80pc), gas char­g­es for Q1 (108.38pc), tea Lipton (106.09pc), wheat flour (101.20pc), gents sponge ch­a­ppal (100.33pc), diesel (99.39pc), bananas (98.22pc), rice basmati broken (90.76pc), eggs (89.40pc), petrol (87.81pc), rice irri-6/9 (83.47pc), pulse moong (66.91pc), bread (62.83pc) and pulse mash (58.79pc).
On a week-on-week basis, the biggest rise was observed in the prices of tomatoes (6.32pc), gur (3.41pc), wheat flour (2.76pc), tea prepared (2.66pc), potatoes (2.14pc), cooked beef (2.12pc), cooked daal (1.98pc), powdered milk (1.91pc), eggs (1.83pc), rice basmati broken (1.42pc), pulse masoor (1.19pc), beef (1.18pc) and washing soap (1.04pc).
According to a finance ministry report, the lower-income segment of society is already feeling the brunt of high inflation, which has become unrelenting on the back of political instability, financial mismanagement and delay in an agr­e­e­ment with the Interna­tional Monetary Fund.
Slow recovery from the flood-led damages had caused the supply of essential crops to remain short of domestic requirements, consequently intensifying inflation, the report added. 
On the other hand, the State Bank of Pakistan was enacting a contractionary monetary policy, “but inflationary expectations are not settling down”, the report noted.
The government has been taking harsh measures — hikes in fuel and power tariffs, withdrawal of subsid­ies, market-based excha­nge rate and higher taxation — under the IMF progra­m­me to generate revenue for bri­d­ging the fiscal deficit, which may result in slow economic growth and hig­her inflation in coming months.

6,Public offer for ZIL shares expires,"According to Topline Securities, the acquirer will end up purchasing 5.19m shares constituting an 84.8pc stake in ZIL Ltd.","KARACHI: ZIL Ltd, a maker of personal care products, said on Friday its foreign acquirer has accepted 1.4 million shares — constituting 23.5 per cent of total shareholding — that were tendered by ordinary investors during the public offer period ending on May 10.
On March 1, New Future Consu­mer International General Trading LLC signed a share purchase agreement with the majority shareholder of ZIL Ltd for the acquisition of a 61.3pc stake in the company.
Subsequently, the acquirer made a “public offer” for 19.3pc shareholding in the locally listed firm at Rs286.64 a share. This exercise is mandatory under the takeover rules that require that the potential buyer of a listed company offer to purchase at least half of the free float, which means the shareholding is owned by the general public.
However, the acquirer revised the public offer and showed interest in buying up to 1.7m shares or 28.6pc of total shareholding at a higher rate of Rs340 apiece.
According to Topline Securities, the acquirer will end up purchasing 5.19m shares constituting an 84.8pc stake in ZIL Ltd along with the shares acquired through the share purchase agreement with the company’s local sponsor.
Speaking to Dawn on Friday, an investment banker involved in the transaction said the acquirer is likely to buy another 5pc stake at a later stage. “The company is likely to go for de-listing once the new board comes in,” he said. ZIL Ltd, the producer of household brands like Capri and Opal soaps, posted a net profit of Rs67.6m in January-March versus a net loss of Rs37.6m a year ago.
