1,Millers demand ‘transparent’ grain procurement policy,LAHORE: A delegation from the Pakistan Flour Mills Association held talks with Food Minister SM Tanveer and ...,"LAHORE: A delegation from the Pakistan Flour Mills Association held talks with Food Minister SM Tanveer and Secretary Muhammad Zaman Wattoo on Friday.
Led by central chairman Asim Raza and Punjab chief Iftikhar Mattoo, the delegation sought acceptance of its demands regarding free movement of wheat and its products across the country.
It also demanded a transparent grain procurement policy with equal rights for all players in the open market.
The millers suggested that the private sector should also be allowed to import wheat to meet local shortages, if any, and permits should be issued to the milling industry through a transparent mechanism.
Mr Raza said in a statement that the minister declared the industry’s demands as legitimate, and that both the department and the PFMA were on the same page regarding sufficient supplies of flour in the market.
He quoted Mr Tanveer as assuring the delegation that their demands would be placed before the provincial cabinet and that all industry problems would be resolved on a priority basis.

2,NA-108 by-polls on 28th,TOBA TEK SINGH: The by-election for Faisalabad NA-108 will be held on May 28.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: The by-election for Faisalabad NA-108 will be held on May 28.
Earlier, April 30 was fixed for the polling, but it was postponed.
A spokesperson for the Faisalabad district election commissioner’s office said on Friday that there were only three candidates in the fray who have already been allotted symbols by the returning officer.
They include Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI’s) Farrukh Habib, Pakistan Nazriati Party’s Khurram Shahzad and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP’s) Muhammad Sajjad Akhtar Qadri.
PML-N’s Mian Tahir Jamil told Dawn that he had withdrawn his nomination papers on the directions of the party high command in line with the decision of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), under which it was decided not to contest any by-election.
In the 2018 general election, PTI’s Farrukh Habib defeated former PML-N federal minister Abid Sher Ali. When all PTI MNAs resigned from NA seats in 2022, NA Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf accepted some of the resignations, including that of Mr Habib, after which a by-election was held on Oct 16, 2022, for this seat in which PTI Chairman Imran Khan defeated PML-N’s Abid Sher Ali.
However, Mr Khan did not retain any of the NA seats he had won, including NA-108. 
Political observers say there is no doubt that PTI’s Habib will win the election with a big majority while PML-N voters will cast their votes in favor of the TLP candidate as an alternative.

3,PTI agitation: Civic agencies’ city operations come to a grinding halt,"LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA), Metropolitan Corporation Lahore (MCL) and zonal administrations...","LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA), Metropolitan Corporation Lahore (MCL) and zonal administrations (formerly the town municipal administrations) have stopped different operations related to demolition and sealing of unlawfully-built and developed buildings and housing schemes, removal of encroachments, misuse of designated parking sites and retrieval of state land for an indefinite period in the provincial capital due to violent protests by the PTI workers, non-availability of police and other issues.  
Meanwhile, the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) had also handed over its entire fleet of water tankers to police to fill the water cannons for dispersing the protesters. However, the agency called back the tankers on Thursday due to various operational issues, Dawn has learnt. 
“For the last 3-4 days, the violent protesters destroyed several state-owned and private properties and vehicles in Lahore. These included Jinnah House in Cantonment (residence of Lahore corps commander), Military Engineering Workshop, a water tanker, a dumper truck and sucker machine of Wasa, police patrolling vehicles etc after arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan. Therefore, the LDA, MCL and zonal administrations etc have decided to halt all sorts of operations in Lahore so as to save precious heavy machinery and equipment, as well as the officials from the wrath of the PTI workers,” an official source told Dawn on Friday.  
“The other reason is the nonavailability of police to accompany the officials in different operations to deal with any law and order situation. The police are busy in dealing with the law and order issues caused by the PTI protests,” he added. 
The official, who requested anonymity, said abrupt suspension of operations has encouraged the mafia involved in flouting building and zoning regulations by constructing various residential and commercial buildings, using parking spaces for other purposes, encroaching the state land etc.  
The official said the last operation the LDA, MCL and zonal administrations carried out jointly was on May 9 (morning hours) at Attari Saroba, Ferozepur Road and adjoining areas. However, such operations were stopped later on the orders of top authorities for an indefinite period. 
He said the Wasa administration called back the tankers following complaints related to water supply to citizens in emergency situations.  
“We had handed over our tankers to police on the orders of Lahore city district administration. But, we finally got back our vehicles on Thursday,” a Wasa official requesting anonymity said. The protesters set Wasa’s machinery and vehicles on fire, he added.  
Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmad and MCL Chief Officer Mr Ali Abbas Bukhari were not available for their comments. When contacted, LDA Chief Town Planner (CTP) Shakil Ahmad confirmed the development and said: “Yes it is true that we have stopped carrying out operations. And it is due to non-availability of police, fear of possible damage to machinery etc,”he said. 
However, the officer hoped that the operations could be resumed from Monday, subject to permission from the higher authorities and normalcy returning to the city. 
The LDA, MCL and zonal administrations, in collaboration with Lahore city administration, police, Traffic Engineering and Planning Agency (Tepa), Wasa, Lahore Parking Company and the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) had launched a mega operation across Lahore against misuse of parking lots, illegal commercialisation, constructions etc after Eid in the light of the reports submitted by the respective departments, action plan etc.  
LGCD: As a practical step towards digitisation of local body institutions, a mobile application -- Baldiya Shikayat -- has been developed to ensure provision of quality municipal services to the public and swiftly resolving citizens’ complaints in 16 cities of Punjab under the World Bank assisted Punjab Cities Programme.  
“We want to extend the scope of this mobile application to the entire province, which was presently functional in Daska, Hafizabad, Jhelum, Kamonki, Mureedke, Wazirabad, Gojra, Jaranwala, Jhang, Kamalia, Okara, Bahawalpur, Borewala, Khanewal, Kot Addu and Vehari,” says Punjab Caretaker Local Government Minister Ibrahim Murad in a meeting.  
The minister ordered devising of an effective monitoring mechanism to resolve the complaints of the citizens.  
To ensure transparency and improve service delivery by municipal bodies, necessary steps were being taken, including introduction of digital governance and development of multi-purpose mobile applications, the minister said.  
Mr Murad was informed that the residents of these cities could register their complaints through the app in the form of an audio message also. A special animated video has also been prepared to educate the citizens about the use of this app.  
“The municipal officials are required to take immediate action on receiving a complaint,” he ordered. The minister directed that the projects being executed under the Punjab Cities Programme, with Rs23 billion funding by the World Bank, should be completed within the stipulated time.  
WASTE: The Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) on Friday completed its ‘Zero-waste’ campaign.  
“The company deputed special teams for cleanliness operation at Zaman Park, Canal Road, Mall Road, Jail Road and adjoining areas. The LWMC’s enforcement wing was also mobilised to take action against illegal dumping of waste,” LWMC CEO Babar Sahib Din said in a statement. During the campaign, the LWMC has ensured cleanliness in the streets, around squares, on main roads, at bus stops and terminals across the city, he added.  
“More than 6,000 containers placed across the city have also been cleared of waste during the camoaign,” he added.

In a tweet on Friday, she said: “The chief justice…as you are using your office for the politics of Imran Khan you should get ready to face political reaction.”
Continuing her tirade against the CJP, Ms Nawaz said Mr Bandial had become a threat not only to the justice system but also to national security.
“It is not worthy of a chief justice to allow the state to become hostage at the hands of a man whose goons had set on fire the symbol of national unity. By becoming a facilitator of Imran the CJP has lost his dignity,” she said.
Earlier, she showed her frustration over the apex court’s order to release Mr Khan on bail.  
“The CJP was happy to meet Imran Khan who is accused of embezzling Rs60bn,” she had said and accused the CJP of shielding this ‘fitna’. She said it would be better for the CJP to “leave his office and join PTI”.

5,"Entry, exit points of Lahore’s Cantt sealed with containers, barbed wire",Official says the extreme steps were taken in the aftermath of the recent attacks of the PTI workers on the Jinnah House.,"LAHORE: The law enforcement agencies have sealed all the entry/exit points of the Lahore Cantonment by placing dozens of containers and barbed wire on them, disallowing every kind of traffic to and from the specific sensitive areas. 
There were reports that a heavy deployment of the LEAs, including a large number of police personnel, has been made at the points in addition to other stringent measures. 
An official said the extreme steps were taken in the aftermath of the recent attacks of the PTI workers on the Jinnah House (Corps Commander House) and other sensitive buildings/installations of the Pakistan Army in Cantt. 
“No transport is allowed to use these roads to enter or leave the sensitively declared part of the Lahore Cantt,” he said. 
The official added that the people residing in the Lahore Cantt were advised to use smaller roads pointed out for the purpose. These small arteries too had been heavily manned by the personnel of the Rangers and the police, he said and added that the security officials also placed barriers on the roads specified for temporary use as entry and exit points. 
There are reports that the local residents of the Lahore Cantt are facing inconvenience to perform their daily routine activities. 
The police said the security measures were taken for a specific period to secure the sensitive installations, following the tension due to the violent agitations of a political party. 
To a question about the education activities in Cantt, the official said the security situation would return to normal in the coming few days and the students would resume activities accordingly. 
To another query, the official denied the reports that the Lahore Cantt has been made a ‘no-go area’ for the general public. He said the local residents and other people requiring entry were allowed to enter the Cantt area after a security process enforced for identification.

7,LHC judges concerned at violence after Imran’s arrest,Govt's law officer thanks judges for showing concern over the violence in the country.,"LAHORE: A Lahore High Court five-judge bench on Friday gave varied remarks on the violent protests by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) against the arrest of its chairman Imran Khan in an alleged corruption case.
Headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, the bench was hearing a petition of former chief minister Usman Buzdar seeking details of cases registered against him.
Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, Justice Anwarul Haq Pannun and Justice Amjad Rafiq were the other members of the bench.
Justice Sheikh asked an additional advocate general whether it was possible to arrest a person hours after the registration of an FIR.
The judge observed that the court could not close its eyes on what happened during the last one year.
Justice Neelum observed that a report should also be summoned on the registration of cases against the predecessors by every succeeding government during the last 10 years.
The judge said another report should be sought on the role of political leadership in the time of crisis. She observed that former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated but the leadership of her party played its sensible role.
Justice Najafi observed that the arrest of politicians was not unusual but what happened after the arrest of the PTI chairman was never seen.
The government’s law officer thanked the judges for showing concern over the violence in the country.
However, Justice Pannun observed that the government should not portray itself innocent as what happened was not a result of one day.
The judge said the reaction was natural if a political leader would be arrested by rangers instead of police and dragged by collar.
He said the highest responsibility lied with the state.
Justice Pannun also questioned the non-implementation of the Supreme Court order by the government.
Justice Sheikh warned the law officer of issuing a notice of contempt when he said courts fixed hearings at nights but nobody raised objections.
Buzdar’s counsel argued that political cases had been registered against his client. He said the petitioner was regularly appearing in the inquiries before the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE).
He asked the court to summon a complete record of the cases registered against the petitioner.
After hearing the arguments, the bench reserved its verdict on the petition.
INVESTIGATION: The caretaker government of Punjab on Friday told the Lahore High Court that PTI Chairman Imran Khan joined the investigation of all the cases registered against him.
A law officer submitted a report before a larger bench regarding the details of the cases registered against Khan till date.
The report revealed that as many as 29 cases were registered in Islamabad against the former prime minister and nine in Punjab. It said Khan had been discharged in two cases in Lahore.
The lawyer also presented the FIRs of three cases relating to fresh violence occurred in Lahore after the arrest of Khan.
Headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, the bench adjourned the hearing of the petition due to unavailability of the PTI chief’s counsel. The bench was told the counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, was busy before the Islamabad High Court.
The petition of Khan alleges that the caretaker chief minister of Punjab seems to have supported the federal government in its political vendetta.
It argues that the facts and the circumstances clearly show that there is a scheme by the ruling coalition to deprive Imran Khan of his liberty and to prevent him from contesting elections.
It pleads that subjecting an individual to numerous proceedings in different jurisdictions on frivolous cases of the same cause of actions cannot be accepted in the law.
The petition asks the court to declare all the FIRs, inquiries and call-up notices against the petitioner as illegal and in violation of his fundamental rights. It also urges the court to summon comprehensive reports from the respondents about the cases registered against the petitioner and restrain them from taking coercive measures against him.
