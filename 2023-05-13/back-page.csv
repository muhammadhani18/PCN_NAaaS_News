0,Gaza sees fierce fighting again as truce hopes fade,Islamic Jihad commander killed in Israeli strike; rallies held in Lebanon in solidarity with Palestinians.,"• Islamic Jihad commander killed in Israeli strike
• Rallies held in Lebanon in solidarity with Palestinians
GAZA CITY: Israel and Gaza militants traded heavy fire on Friday as hopes faded of securing a truce to end days of fighting that have killed dozens, all but one of them Palestinian.
The violence has been met with international calls for de-escalation, with the European Union pushing for an “immediate comprehensive ceasefire”.
Israel announced it was “striking Islamic Jihad targets” in the densely populated Palestinian territory, while AFP journalists saw air strikes hit Gaza City.
Sirens warning of incoming fire meanwhile rang out in Israeli communities close to the border with the Gaza Strip, as well as blaring in an Israeli settlement near Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank.
Violence broke out Tuesday when Israel killed three top members of the Islamic Jihad group, while subsequent strikes have killed at least three other senior figures.
A high-ranking commander, Iyad al-Hassani, was killed in a strike on a Gaza City apartment on Friday, a spokesman for the group said.
Hours earlier, Islamic Jihad said the latest rocket fire was a “response to the assassinations and the continued aggression against the Palestinian people”.
The launches came after a rocket killed one civilian in the central Israeli city of Rehovot on Thursday night.
At least 33 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry, including children.
Daily life in the coastal territory, ruled by the Hamas group, has largely come to a standstill, while Israel has told its citizens near Gaza to stay close to bomb shelters.
In Gaza’s central Deir al-Balah area, farmer Belal Basher stood beside the ruins of the home he said was hit by multiple Israeli strikes. “Our situation is the same as that of any Palestinian citizen whose house is targeted and whose dream, built over the years, is destroyed,” the 33-year-old said.
Earlier, there had been cautious optimism a truce may be nearing, with an Islamic Jihad source saying a deal drawn up by Cairo had been circulated among the group’s leadership.
But the source subsequently said Israel was “disrupting Egypt’s efforts for a ceasefire”.
The decision to renew air strikes on Gaza this week was authorised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned to power in December alongside extreme-right and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies.
The violence has wounded more than 110 people in Gaza, according to the latest health ministry toll.
Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency services has treated five people who were hit by shrapnel or glass, or suffered blast injuries from the rocket fire.
Rallies in Lebanon
The United States, which along with the European Union has blacklisted Islamic Jihad and Hamas as terrorist groups, urged that steps be “taken to ensure that violence is reduced”.
In Lebanon, rallies were held in solidarity with Gaza in multiple refugee camps hosting Palestinians. “Resisters, strike Tel Aviv,” protesters chanted in Sidon, home to the country’s largest refugee camp.
The Israeli military said it has hit 170 Islamic Jihad targets this week, while more than 860 rockets have been fired from Gaza.
Israel said a quarter of the rockets struck inside Gaza and killed four, including three children, an accusation Islamic Jihad and Hamas did not respond to when approached by AFP.
This week’s escalation is the worst since August, when 49 Gazans were killed in three days of fighting between Islamic Jihad and Israel.
At least 19 of those were children, according to the United Nations, while rocket fire wounded three people in Israel. That conflict followed multiple wars fought between Israel and Hamas since the group took control of Gaza in 2007.
An Israeli blockade imposed since then has made it impossible for the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents to leave the territory, where poverty and unemployment are rife.

1,Two-thirds of young women in UK face workplace harassment,The TUC says the new law protecting workers is being sabotaged by some lawmakers from the governing Conservative party.,"LONDON: Two out of every three young women have faced sexual harassment, bullying or verbal abuse in the workplace in Britain, according to a survey published on Friday. 
But most victims do not report incidents for fear they will not be believed or that it might harm work relationships and career prospects, said UK umbrella labour organisation the Trades Union Congress (TUC). 
They released the results as part of a campaign to persuade Britain’s government not to backtrack on new laws aimed at protecting workers from assault and harassment. 
In its poll of 1,000 women, the TUC said that three out of every five reported such incidents at work — but that climbed to two thirds among those aged between 25 and 34 years. 
Most cases occurred on work premises but also happened via phone, text messages and emails, and via social media or virtual meetings. 
And rather than being isolated incidents they were often repeated, the survey found. 
The TUC says the new law protecting workers is being sabotaged by some lawmakers from the governing Conservative party. 
“Every woman should be safe from sexual harassment but every day we hear stories about the extent of sexual harassment in our workplaces,” said TUC general secretary Paul Nowak. 
“We know many women in public-facing jobs — like retail workers and GP receptionists — suffer regular abuse from customers and patients. “Sexual harassment and bullying have no place in modern workplaces.” 
Fewer than one in every three women who experienced sexual harassment had informed their employer, the survey found.

2,"US wants ties with Pakistan, not with a party or candidate",State Department refuses to guess impact of political crisis on safety of nuclear assets.,"WASHINGTON: The United States has said that it wants partnership with a strong and prosperous Pakistan, not with a political party or a candidate.
At a Thursday afternoon news briefing in Washington, a spokesperson for the US Department of State also refused to guess the impact of the current political crisis on the safety of Pakistan’s nuclear assets.
“I’m just not going to speculate on that. That is something internal to Pakistan,” said Spokesperson Vedant Patel when asked if Washington had concerns about the safety of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons.
The current political situation in Pakistan often comes up for discussion at various briefings and hearings in Washington, including at the White House, Congress, the State Department, and the think-tanks.

State Department refuses to guess impact of political crisis on safety of N-assets

On Thursday, it was also raised at a briefing at the IMF where Spokesperson Julie Kozack was asked if the IMF was worried about the impact of the crisis on the country’s already ailing economy.
At the State Department briefing, Mr Patel was asked specifically about attacks on military offices and homes earlier this week. “We continue to monitor the situation in Pakistan closely, and as the US has said before, we don’t have a position on one candidate or one political party versus another,” he responded.
 
 

“What our interest is, is a safe and secure, prosperous Pakistan. That is in the interest of the US-Pakistan relations,” he said.
Responding to another question about restoring internet services in Pakistan, which were closed earlier this week, the US official recalled that Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke about this issue at a recent briefing.
The internet, he said, was also needed to “communicate with one another, to make informed decisions, to hold government officials accountable, and to exercise their freedom of expression”.
Mr Patel disagreed with a journalist who suggested that the US was reluctant to take a stand on the dispute between the Pakistan government and Imran Khan.
“I would reject the premise of your question,” he said. “That is true, we do not have a favoured candidate or a favoured political party, not just in Pakistan but as it relates to any government system around the world.”
Referring to similar briefings at the White House, Mr Patel said his colleagues at the White House were right that “a prosperous and strong, democratic Pakistan is critical to US interests. That remains unchanged”.
But in some of these areas, such as press freedom, human rights, “we have consistently raised these issues with our counterparts not just in Pakistan but in other countries” as well, he added.
In Pakistan, “the United States is … looking to continue to strengthen economic ties between our two countries by expanding private sector trade and investment,” Mr Patel said.
“There’s also an important security collaboration and areas of collaboration on renewable energy, addressing the climate crisis, increasing agricultural trade, and a number of areas.”
Responding to a question about Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan, Mr Patel said that “Pakistan continues to be an important partner in the region — an important trade partner, an important security partner”.

3,Iran frees two French citizens,"PARIS: Iran on Friday released two French citizens jailed in separate cases, France said, urging Tehran to release...","

Bernard Phelan

 
PARIS: Iran on Friday released two French citizens jailed in separate cases, France said, urging Tehran to release four others still detained in the Islamic republic. 
Bernard Phelan, who also holds Irish nationality, and Benjamin Briere were freed from their prison in the northeastern city of Mashhad and are “on their way to France”, Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said. 
There had been grave concerns about the health of both men, both of whom had been on hunger strikes to protest their conditions. 
President Emmanuel Macron added on Twitter: “Free, finally. Benjamin Briere and Bernard Phelan can reunite with their loved ones. It’s a relief.” 


Benjamin Briere

 
The pair were among some two dozen foreigners jailed in Iran who campaigners see as hostages held in a deliberate strategy by Tehran to extract concessions from the West. 
Phelan, 64, a Paris-based travel consultant, was arrested in October in Mashhad and has been held ever since. In April, he was jailed for six and a half years on national security charges strongly rejected by his family. 
Phelan was accused of taking photos of a burned mosque and police officers, and sending images to a British newspaper, the family said.
Phelan went on a dry hunger strike in January to protest his detention, refusing both food and water. But he stopped the action at the request of his family, who feared he would die. 
Briere, 37, was first detained while travelling in Iran in May 2020 and later sentenced to eight years in prison for espionage. Although acquitted by an appeals court, he remained in prison in a situation described as “incomprehensible” by his family. 
Held like Phelan in the prison of Vakilabad in Mashhad, Briere also went on hunger strikes to protest his conditions.

4,Erdogan rival accuses Russia of interference in election,Kremlin denies allegations of meddling; Erdogan alleges Western govts using the opposition to impose their will on how Turkish society works.,"ANKARA: Kemal Kilicd­aroglu, main challenger of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, claimed on Friday his party has concrete evidence of Russia’s responsibility for the release of “deep fake” online content ahead of Sunday’s presidential elections.
Kilicdaroglu, who has a slight poll lead over Erdogan two days ahead of the election, told Reuters in an interview it was unacceptable for Russia to interfere in Turkiye’s internal affairs, but added that should he become president he would maintain Ankara’s good ties with Moscow.
Asked why he tweeted on Thursday that Russia was responsible for fake online content, a bold move, Kilicdaroglu said: “If we did not have it (concrete evidence), I wouldn’t have tweeted.”
 

Screengrab of Kilicdaroglu’s tweet made on May 11 along with its Google translation.

His party did not contact the Russian embassy over the issue, he added. He did not elaborate on what the online content was.

Kremlin denies allegations of meddling

One presidential candidate from a small party, Muharrem Ince, withdrew on Thursday citing a faked “character assassination” carried out online. He gave few details.
Russia denies interfering
Russia has been accused in the past of meddling in foreign elections, including in the United States, which Moscow denies.
Turkiye’s vote on Sunday shapes up as the most consequential in its modern history, with huge implications for Ankara’s global standing, strategic alliances and economic direction.
“We find it unacceptable for another country to interfere in Turkey’s election process in favour of a political party. I wanted the whole world to be aware of this, that is why I made this call openly by a tweet,” Kilicdaroglu said in an interview.
The Kremlin later denied interfering. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the people who had passed on such allegations to Kilicdaroglu were liars and that Russia valued its ties with Turkiye enormously.
Kilicdaroglu wore a steel vest for an election rally on Friday on “intelligence that he could be attacked”, a source from his party said.
Erdogan has been trying to rally his base ahead of elections Sunday that put his Islamic style of rule in the largest Muslim-majority member of Nato on the line.
Opinion surveys show Kilicdaroglu with a slight advantage and within a whisker of breaking the 50-per cent threshold needed to avoid a runoff on May 28.
Erdogan was uncharacteristically coy about making predictions about the outcome of Turkiye’s most consequential election of modern times. “The ballot box will tell us Sunday,” he said.
He warned that Kilicdaroglu’s opposition alliance was driven by “vengeance and greed”. He alleged that Western governments were using the opposition to impose their will on how Turkish society worked.

5,First Indian movie hits Bangladesh screens in 50 years,"Pathaan releases in 41 theatres across country; Information minister says ""standard of Pakistani films also improved"" after importing Indian films.","DHAKA: Thousands flocked to cinemas in Dhaka on Friday as Shah Rukh Khan’s blockbuster “Pathaan” hit the big screens, the first Bollywood movie to get a full release in Bangladesh in more than half a century.
The action-packed spy thriller smashed box office records when it opened in India in January and the star has a huge fan following around the world.
But Dhaka banned films from its neighbour soon after its independence in 1971, in the face of lobbying from local movie-makers.
“I am so excited because a Hindi film is being released in Bangladesh for the first time,” said Sazzad Hossain, 18, at a cineplex in the capital. “We are all Shah Rukh Khan fans. For the first time I’ll watch Shah Rukh Khan on a giant screen.”

Blockbuster Pathaan released in 41 theatres across country

 
 

Bangladeshi cinemas have gone into steep decline, with poor-quality local films unable to match Bollywood’s glitz and glamour or draw audiences, and the ageing Shakib Khan its only bankable star.
Some movie houses even switched to illegally showing pornography to try to remain viable, but more than 1,000 have shut their doors over the last 20 years, many of them to be converted to shopping centres or apartments.
At the Modhumita Cinema Hall, once Dhaka’s most luxurious movie theatre, heroin addicts sat outside this week in front of posters for Jinn, a newly released Bangladeshi movie.
“I haven’t seen such a poor crowd in many years,” said one theatre employee.  “Only a few rows have been filled up. Nobody watches these local art movies or films with poor storylines.” Cinemas used to be a mainstay of Bangladeshi social life.
“This hall was like a great meeting place of the Old Dhaka community,” Pradip Narayan said at the Manoshi Complex, a 100-year-old movie theatre turned into a market in 2017.
“Women used to come in the night to watch films here. Our mothers and sisters from neighbouring areas would come here, and when the show ended at midnight or 12:30 at night, it looked like a fair here. A woman even gave birth to a child in this cinema hall. Such was the craze for movies back then.”
Authorities attempted to lift the ban on Indian movies in 2015 when two Bollywood hits — “Wanted” and “The Three Idiots” — were screened, but protests by local movie stars forced theatres to stop the shows.
The government finally issued a decree last month allowing the import of 10 movies a year from India or South Asian nations.
“In Pakistan, the number of cinemas came down to 30-35 once. Then they allowed importing Indian Hindi films,” said Information Minister Hasan Mahmud.
“The number of cinemas has since risen to about 1,200 and the standard of Pakistani films also improved.”
 
 

“Pathaan” was released in 41 theatres across the country and many shows in the capital were already sold out, said distributor Anonno Mamun.
Allowing the screening of Bollywood movies would prove to be a “game-changer”, he said, adding: “Everyone loves Hindi movies here. Many also love southern Indian movies.”
Modhumita cinema’s owner Mohammed Iftekharuddin — a former president of the Bangladesh Motion Picture Exhibitors Association — is hoping for a business turnaround. “I think 200-300 more cinema halls will reopen after this,” he said.
“Monopoly destroys business. When there is competition, there will be business.”
But Bangladeshi filmmakers are alarmed at the prospect, with some threatening to protest by wearing white shrouds of death to symbolise the demise of the local industry.
“Don’t they know about the Nepalese film industry?” asked director Khijir Hayat Khan. “Don’t they see that the Mexican film industry was destroyed after opening the market (to Hollywood’s products)?”
Nonetheless, there is undou­btedly unsatisfied demand am­o­ng audiences. Forest depar­tment official Raj Ahmed, 30, travelled 250 kilometres from Khulna in southern Bangladesh to see “Pathaan”, but could not secure a ticket.
“I feel very bad,” he said. “I was waiting for many days to watch Shah Rukh Khan on a big screen.”
