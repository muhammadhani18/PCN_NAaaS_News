6,Irregularities detected in Rs300m minorities project,Planning dept recommends high-level probe into matter.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa planning and development department has detected irregularities in a Rs300 million project meant to mark festivals of religious minorities, arrange conferences of interfaith harmony, and an ‘exposure’ programme for non-Muslim youths.
It recommended a “high-level” inquiry into the matter to fix responsibility for action.
The project was executed by the Auqaf, Hajj, religious and minorities affairs department in 2022 for the promotion of interfaith harmony in the province, revealed its monitoring and evaluation report prepared by the P&D department.
According to it, the project was about holding “minority youth exposure, interfaith harmony conferences, capacity building and summit, music and singing and art competitions, and adventure programmes providing the people of different faiths with a platform to express their views in front of all.”

Planning dept recommends high-level probe into matter

The report said in 2021, the Auqaf department executed an identical project at the cost of Rs40 million but the next year, the project in question was designed for Rs300 million with a cost escalation of 700 per cent.
The P&D department wondered why the Auqaf department advertised the project three times and didn’t give any reason for the withdrawal of procurement process.
“Firstly, the department floated request for proposal regarding ‘single stage, two envelopes’ method for hiring of consultancy services with the technical bids opening scheduled on 13.01.2022. Later on, the said advertisement was cancelled and another request for proposal was sent for publication by opting ‘single stage, one envelope’ bidding method and the bids opening was scheduled on 31.01.2022.
“Finally, a third request for proposal was advertised by cancelling the previous one and the bidding mode was once again altered to ‘single stage, two envelopes’ method,” the report read.
It said the final date for opening of bids on the least cost method was Jan 31, 2022, whereas the bids rejection letter was issued on March 1, 2022.
The report wondered whether the bids opening process was carried out or not.
“In case the bids opening took place, then what were its results?”
The planning and development department also complained why the technical bids were opened on March 24, 2022, before the scheduled date of March 30 even after publishing the corrigendum.
It also raised questions about the act of declaring the firm, which executed the scheme as a successful bidder despite not fulfilling the requisite passing score of 70 per cent in technical evaluation.
The department questioned the execution of the project in one year against the planned two years i.e. 2021-22 and 2022-23.
It said though the Auqaf department had already executed such a project with mentioned activities a year before the project, why much of the project time was wasted in finalising the bidders and firms selection criteria.
Sources in the P&D department told Dawn that the project was advertised multiple times prompting five firms to apply for contract but only one of them was shortlisted with the rest being declared by the department “non-responsive.”
hey also claimed that according to the laid-down procedure, once a single bidder qualified without any competition for second stage, the relevant department should advertise the project for healthy competition.
Officials of the Auqaf department were not available for comments.

7,Mansehra residents demand smooth flour supply,MANSEHRA: Residents on Friday demanded of the government to ensure uninterrupted flour supply to all parts of...,"MANSEHRA: Residents on Friday demanded of the government to ensure uninterrupted flour supply to all parts of Mansehra district to control the soaring price of the staple commodity.
“As the wheat flour’s price has hit record high due to an acute shortage, authorities should ensure the immediate supply of wheat flour by the local millers to the market,” chairman of the Chajar Syedain village council Zahir Khan Swati told reporters in Oghi tehsil.
Accompanied by members of his village council, Mr Swati said the Punjab government had banned the transportation of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa prompting the prices of staple items to skyrocket.
He said a 20kg flour bag was selling for Rs3,450-Rs3,650, the highest ever price recorded by the district.
The council chairman claimed that millers were taking an undue advantage from the current situation as they’d stopped grinding wheat to increase flour price.
Councillor Malik Nazeer said record inflation rate was reported in the country with the prices of essential commodities, including flour and pulses, going through the roof due to bad governance.
He said the federal government supplied electricity from Tarbela Dam in KP to Punjab, so why it couldn’t ensure the smooth supply of wheat and flour from Punjab to KP to the relief of the residents.
ENCROACHMENTS: Traders on Friday called for an effective anti-encroachment operation on the Karakoram Highway in Shinkiari town and adjoining areas.
President of the Shinkiari trader body Mazhar Bashir told reporters that the people had encroached on the KKH in Mansehra city and on its outskirts blocking traffic and hampering business.
He said that the National Highway Authority had served notices on encroachers to remove illegal structures but the latter disregarded them.
Mr Bashir said that temporary encroachments and handcarts also hampered traffic on the KKH to the misery of motorists, shoppers and pedestrians.
Trader Niaz Mohammad Khan said the tehsil municipal administration of Baffa-Pakhal should initiate anti-encroachment operation without delay as it had already served notices on encroachers.
He said that illegal bus terminals also caused traffic issues in the area.
“The Baffa-Pakhal TMA and NHA have not taken the encroachment issue seriously though we took it up with them many times,” he said.
Mr Khan warned members of the business community along with other residents would take to the streets against roadside encroachments.

12,Justice Hilali sworn in as PHC’s first regular woman CJ,PESHAWAR: Justice Musarrat Hilali was sworn in as the first regular woman chief justice of the Peshawar High Court ...,"PESHAWAR: Justice Musarrat Hilali was sworn in as the first regular woman chief justice of the Peshawar High Court at a ceremony held here at the Governor’s House on Friday.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Haji Ghulam Ali administered oath to Justice Hilali, who had already been serving as the acting chief justice since Apr 1.
The Judicial Commission of Pakistan had recommended appointment of Justice Hilali as regular chief justice of the high court. The parliamentary committee for appointment of judges had given approval to the said recommendation followed by issuance of a presidential notification of her appointment on May 8.
Born in Peshawar on Aug 8, 1961, Justice Hilali, will retire on Aug 7 this year.
The oath taking ceremony was attended by the caretaker chief minister, Mohammad Azam Khan, judges of the high court, provincial ministers, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Police Officer Akhter Hayat Khan, lawyers and government officials.
Justice Hilali is the second regular woman chief justice of any high court in the country as earlier in 2018, Justice Syeda Tahira Safdar was appointed as the chief justice of Balochistan High Court.
Justice Hilali, during her over a month stint as acting chief justice, has visited different prisons as well as judicial complexes and issued several orders for improving the conditions there.
Recently, she has issued directives to the family court judges to expedite disposal of cases, specially those which could not be decided in the stipulated time period of six months.
Recently, the senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faez Isa has also reportedly recommended to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan to elevate Justice Hilali to the apex court.
A known human rights activist, Justice Hilali had received her law degree from Khyber Law College, University of Peshawar, and was enrolled as an advocate of district courts in 1983. She was enrolled as an advocate of the high court in 1988 and that of the Supreme Court in 2006.
Justice Hilali has earned several distinctions in her career as a lawyer and then as a judge of the high court.
She was an active member of the Peshawar High Court Bar Association and served as its first female secretary, vice president and general secretary. She was also twice elected as an executive member of the Supreme Court Bar Association for 2007-8 and 2008-9.
She served as the first woman additional advocate general from November 2001 to March 2004 and as chairperson of the KP Environmental Protection Tribunal. She had activated the otherwise dormant environmental tribunal and regularly been hearing cases related to environmental degradation.
Justice Hilali was also the first federal ombudsperson appointed in 2010 under the Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act 2010. She was elevated to the bench as an additional judge on March 26, 2013, and was confirmed as a judge of the high court on March 13, 2014.
Justice Hilali remained a focal member of the 2007 lawyers’ movement — started after a reference was filed against then CJP Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry — during which she stood alongside the rest of the male-majority legal fraternity.
During that movement, one of her legs got fractured when police raided her residence for arresting her.
She was also considered a close associate of late Asma Jahangir and had also served as the provincial head of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.

13,"‘Last chance’ for govt to respond to plea against birth, death registration rules",PHC bench directs officials to file reply by 25th,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has given ‘last chance’ to the provincial government for responding to a petition challenging the local government rules regarding registration of births, deaths, marriages and divorces by the village and neighbourhood councils.
A bench consisting of Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad directed the KP chief secretary and secretary local government to file their comments by May 25, the next date of hearing.
The petition is filed by a resident of Nowshera, Faheemullah, contending that the relevant rules of the KP Birth, Death, Nikkah, Divorce and Dissolution of Marriages (Registration and Verification) Rules, 2021, were not only illegal and in violation of the KP Local Government Act, 2013, but they also created problems for the applicants.
He has requested the court to strike down these rules. The petitioner also contended against the rules for imposing fee for issuance of certificates.

PHC bench directs officials to file reply by 25th

Advocate Shah Faisal Ilyas appeared for the petitioner and said his client had approached his village council for registration of the birth of his sons aged seven and three respectively, but the council’s secretary refused to do so insisting that under the 2021 rules, those entries had to be made within 90 days of the birth.
He said the father of the petitioner died in 1990 and recently he approached the council for issuance of his death certificate but it was denied by the secretary on the basis of the same 90-day restriction.
The lawyer said the petitioner got married in 2015 and as he required a marriage certificate for his wife’s CNIC, the secretary refused it saying the marriage should have been registered within 90 days under the rules.
He contended that the wife of the petitioner suffered from a serious health issue, so she urgently required the CNIC to avail herself of free medical treatment under the Sehat Sahulat Programme.
Mr Ilyas argued that in the relevant rules, a very cumbersome and time-consuming procedure had been given for registration of a birth, death, marriage or divorce if the limitation period of 90 days had passed, as the applicant had to move a civil court to get a decree of declaration.
He contended that those rules had been applied retrospectively to births and deaths, which took place much before the year 2021.
The counsel argued that the rules were always framed to facilitate people, so the rules in question should be in consonance with the law but, he said, they were framed in violation of the LG Act.
He contended that the LG Act, 2013, had no limitation for the issuance of those certificates, so the government had violated the law by imposing the 90-day restriction.
The lawyer said that those rules created problems not only for the people but also for the civil courts, which were already overburdened with thousands of cases.
He stated that despite the court’s order the respondents including the KP chief secretary and the secretary local government had not been filing their comments.

Talking to Dawn, they said they did not rule out further increase in wheat grain price in the next few days because of an uptick in demand amid fear of food shortages in the months to come.
It was observed that those who did not cultivate wheat crop didn’t believe they would get a smooth supply of wheat flour for the entire year, thus the rush for stocking grain.
Mohammad Tariq of Maneri Bala said as there was no surety about the availability of flour and stable prices in the market, so the people were purchasing wheat in bulk. 
He said price of grain started increasing when the crop’s harvest began.
Sher Khan, a grain dealer, said price of wheat had jumped to Rs5,000 per 50kg bag soon after its threshing got completed. 
“The price has kept increasing, and has now reached Rs6,200.”
It was confirmed from various regions that farmers were selling a 50kg bag as high as Rs6,500.
“We expect more increases because farmers are not bringing grain for sale to market like the previous years as they believe the price would further increase,” Sher Khan said.
Ajab Khan of Topi city said he was not in position to purchase wheat grain at such a high price.
Meanwhile, it has been learnt that flour mill owners have also devised their own strategy to collect wheat grain from growers at rates lesser than being offered to common consumers.
Millers said they usually purchased the grain from farmers during its harvesting period.
They alleged that Afghans living in two refugee camps and in various localities were also purchasing the grain in bulk to smuggle it to Afghanistan, causing its price to increase. 
They demanded of the government to take practical steps to ensure refugees didn’t stock the wheat for onward smuggling to their home country, where they got good rates.
