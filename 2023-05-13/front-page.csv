0,‘Victorious’ Imran returns home after blanket relief,Told to take action against PTI workers involved in protests.,"• Told to take action against PTI workers involved in protests
• Gunshots heard when ex-PM was still in IHC building
ISLAMABAD: Having locked himself in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises for hours for fear of arrest despite being granted bail on Friday, a triumphant Imran Khan left for Lahore late in the night without addressing the charged party workers who had been earlier directed by him to be ready for a possible protest.
The PTI chairman was granted a blanket relief from different benches of IHC that not only barred the authorities from arresting him but also stayed his trial in the Toshakhana case until the second week of June.
Before leaving for his Lahore residence, Mr Khan, in a video message, appealed to the nation “to be ready for a massive protest” and lashed out at the “imported government for kidnapping” him despite the bail granted to him by the IHC in all cases.
 






Clad in a sky blue shalwar kameez and a dark blue waistcoat, he said: “They have kidnapped me and forcibly kept me here. I want to tell the whole nation that it is their bad intention, they want to do something again and the whole nation should ready itself to protest”.
After spending nearly 11 hours on the IHC premises, the ex-premier finally left the federal capital without addressing charged PTI workers who remained on the streets throughout the day.
However, gunshots were heard when he  was still inside the court building.
In another video message, while on way to Lahore, Mr Khan said that Islamabad IGP Akbar Nasir had left no stone unturned to retain him at the IHC but his protest threat worked and he was able to leave the place.
 






Earlier, at one point in time, Mr Khan put his finger on his lips when journalists bombarded him with questions and on another occasion, he was seen waving a fist in front of TV cameras as a mark of victory.
Friday was the day of Mr Khan when four different IHC benches granted his over a dozen petitions by barring the authorities from arresting him in different cases.
Under the blanket relief, the authorities have been restrained from taking him into custody at least till May 15, while in some cases till the last week of this month.
In the Al Qadir Trust case, in which NAB arrested him on May 9, the IHC division bench, comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, granted him pre-arrest interim bail for two weeks.
The Supreme Court had a day earlier declared Mr Khan’s arrest from the IHC premises illegal and referred the matter to the IHC.
Merits of arrest
Khawaja Haris Ahmed, counsel for Mr Khan, argued before the division bench that NAB could not arrest a suspect during the course of inquiry under the amended National Accountability Ordinance.
The arrest could only be made during the investigation, that too for non-cooperation by a suspect, he said, adding that the inquiry was upgraded into investigation on April 27 and Mr Khan learnt this through a newspaper on April 30.
He argued that NAB had issued only one call-up notice in this case to which the former premier had replied.
“The petitioner was under an impression that the case has been closed,” argued Advocate Ahmed.
Bail plea opposed
Advocate General, Islamabad, Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon, opposed the bail plea arguing that the court could not take up such petition under Article 199 since the army has been deployed in the capital under Article 245. He then suggested that Mr Khan approach the accountability court to seek bail.
Justice Aurangzeb, however, intervened sarcastically: “Mr Advocate General, you should advise your government to close down the courts.” He then asked if martial law had been imposed in Pakistan.
NAB’s deputy prosecutor general Sardar Muzaffar Khan Abbasi argued that other accused in the same case, including property tycoon Malik Riaz, Zulfi Bukhari, Mian Mohammad Soomro and some members of Mr Khan’s cabinet, had joined the investigation, but neither Mr Khan nor his former aide Shahzad Akbar joined it.
Justice Aurangzeb, however, noted that NAB had not followed the law laid down by superior courts in issuing the call up notices. Subsequently, the court granted Mr Khan interim bail for two weeks.
In another case seeking protection in the cases registered against Mr Khan while he was in custody, the court sought details of FIRs and restrained police from arresting him.
Toshakhana reference
Earlier, IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq stayed trial proceeding in the Toshakhana case till June 8. He was hearing three identical petitions related to the said case against Mr Khan’s indictment and one seeking transfer of his case to another judge.
Another division bench comprising Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir granted transitory bail to Mr Khan in six FIRs registered against him at different police stations in Punjab.
The division bench also restrained the police from arresting Mr Khan under Maintenance of Public Order or any other law, while directing the PTI chief to join the investigation and approach the Lahore High Court for further relief.
In his petition, the former prime minister challenged the police protection and said that despite the clear Supreme Court orders, he had been kept in the police guest house and the police curtailed his liberty in disguise of the so-called protection.
While granting relief to Mr Khan, Justice Aurangzeb requested him to disassociate himself from recent violence in the country and condemn it.
He also asked him to take strict action against those party workers who were involved in damaging public and private properties.
Earlier, PTI’s information secretary Farrukh Habib in a statement alleged that Mr Khan’s personal security and car were not being allowed to reach the IHC building as the “fascist government” was delaying his departure unnecessarily in the name of security clearance.

1,Mobile data services restored,"The services, which have been suspended since violent protests broke out on May 9, were restored at around 10pm.","ISLAMABAD: A few hours after Interior Minis­ter Rana Sanaullah on Friday proclaimed to keep the internet blocked “till the arrest of miscreants who set fire to people’s houses,” mobile data services and the suspended social media platforms were restored.
The services, which have been suspended since violent protests broke out following the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on May 9, were restored at around 10pm.
After Mr Khan was granted bail by the Islamabad High Court, the interior ministry withdrew its advisory issued on May 9 to suspend mobile data service and social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, a Pakistan Telec­ommun­ication Authority spokesperson told Dawn.
Earlier, while talking to the media, the interior minister hinted that the government was in no mood to restore social media platforms and mobile data services.
“It will take some time to arrest the miscreants who set fire to people’s houses and the internet services might remain blocked till then,” he added.
However, the government itself, was under severe pressure from several quarters to restore the internet, sources told Dawn.
The IT and telecommunication minister had also expressed concerns over the prolonged suspension and directly approached Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to restore services.
GSMA Asia Pacific head Julian Gorman also wrote to the IT and telecommunication ministry to restore mobile data service.
The body, which represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide, said the restrictions were causing harm to businesses and eventually damaging Pakistan’s reputation for managing the economy and foreign investment.
“The GSMA represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, and is concerned about the impact that the current restrictions are having on citizens and businesses in Pakistan,” Mr Gorman wrote in the letter.
“In today’s digital societies individuals and businesses rely on connectivity for their livelihoods and access to essential services and information, prolonged restrictions can also have far-reaching effects on citizens’ health, education, social and economic welfare.”
Locally, telecom companies also expressed dismay over the suspension of mobile data service.
Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim said mobile broadband was the lifeline of the digital ecosystem and a critical enabler of productivity across all sectors.

2,Verdicts about Imran termed ‘black stain’ on judiciary,"PM says judiciary is defending PTI leader like an ""iron shield"".","ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet has described the treatment given to PTI Chairman Imran Khan this week as a “black stain” on the face of judiciary and expressed anger over the loss of private and public property during violent protests erupted after his arrest, but rejected the option of imposing an emergency in the country.
Presiding over the cabinet meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said judiciary was defending Mr Khan like an “iron shield”.
Inside sources told Dawn that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had floated the proposal of declaring an emergency in the country, but it was rejected by three mainstream political parties — Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F (JUI-F) and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M).
 
 

The sources said Mr Asif believed that imposing an emergency was imperative given the prevailing uncertainty and the law and order situation in the country.

PPP, JUI-F, BNP-M oppose PML-N proposal for imposition of emergency; PM says judiciary is defending PTI leader like an ‘iron shield’

However, PPP leader Farh­atullah Babar told Dawn his party had opposed the idea.
Emergency is proclaimed by the president under Article 232 of the Constitution and it has to be endorsed by both houses of the parliament, i.e. the Senate and the National Assembly.
During an emergency, imposed for a maximum of one year, all fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution are suspended.
The cabinet expressed grave concern over what it called “undue facilitation” given to Mr Khan by the Supreme Court at the time when he was under eight-day physical remand in a corruption case.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Mr Sharif rejected what he called “double standards of justice” being meted out to Imran Khan in the case. “Judiciary has become an iron shield for Imran Khan,” he said in the meeting.
He vowed that the ruling coalition would take every step to ensure the rule of law in the country.
“Other political leaders in the country faced trials and tough handling, while Imran Khan was given privileged treatment. These are the double standards of justice,” he said.
The prime minister said he was surprised by the remarks of the chief justice of the Supreme Court during Thursday’s hearing, where he said that he was pleased to meet Imran Khan.
 
 

The premier pointed out that thousands of cases by the general public were pending with the courts while some political figures were given special favour of bail on a priority basis.
He alleged that the judiciary had also protected Mr Khan previously in corruption cases, including the Bus Rapid Transit Project (BRT), Billion Tree Tsunami tree plantation and Malam Jabba development projects. He claimed that there was solid evidence of corruption by the PTI, but those cases were not pursued.
He said the PTI chief was part of an agenda to bring fascist rule to the country for 10 years.
The premier said May 9 — when protesters wreaked havoc across the country after Mr Khan’s arrest and attacked national and military installations — was a painful day in the country’s history.
He recalled that despite the assassination of PPP leader Benazir Bhutto, her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, raised the slogan of ‘Pakistan Khappay’ (We want Pakistan) as a great gesture of nationalism. Also, nobody hit the military installations even after the “judicial murder” of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, he said.
Mr Sharif recalled that at the time of the death of his mother, he was in prison but passed the time with patience rather than inciting the public to riots.
He alleged that the PTI chairman was the mastermind and planner behind the attacks on military institutions.
The country, he said, was passing through a difficult time and the coalition government was making efforts to address the inherited challenges.
The premier lambasted the PTI leadership for pushing the country towards the brink of a dangerous situation. He recalled that Mr Khan had for months made “false and shameless” claims about his ouster from the rule through a so-called regime change by the United States but ultimately reversed his stance.
He also accused Mr Khan of inflicting every possible damage on the fabric of society by promoting hatred and intolerance.

3,Former PM Imran blames army chief for arrest episode,"Refutes impression of getting ""relief"" from the Supreme Court; distances himself from violent protests.","ISLAMABAD: PTI chief Imran Khan on Friday blamed the army chief for his “abduction” on May 9 and distanced himself from violence that took place in several cities after his arrest.
He expressed these views while having brief conversation with media persons on the premises of Islamabad High Court.
Talking to BBC correspondent Caroline Davies during a break time, Mr Khan said: “It’s not the security agencies. It’s one man, the army chief. There is no democracy in the army. The army is getting maligned with what is happening,” he replied when asked about the impression that security agencies were against him whereas the judiciary was favouring him.
“And he [the army chief] is worried that if I come to power, I will de-notify him. Which, I tried my best to send him a message, I will not. All this is happening is direct orders from him. He is the one who is convinced that if I win, he will be de-notified,” alleged Mr Khan.
The ex-premier also talked about “victimisation” of his party by the government, alleging that “5,000 people have been arrested during the last one year”. He said he had survived two assassination attempts and had only called for an investigation, regretting that his demand had been rejected.

Refutes impression of getting ‘relief’ from SC; distances himself from violent protests

Responding to a question by
Quratul Ain Sheerazi of the Independent Urdu that he had got a relief from the Supreme Court which had never been provided to any other politician, Mr Khan said how could it be called a relief when he was still sitting in the court.
 
 

“I am sitting in the Islamabad High Court. They had no justification to arrest me. I was abducted. They showed me warrant for the first time after taking me to jail. This happens only where there is a law of jungle and where army abducts [people],” he said.
“Where is the law? Where are the police? It seems that martial law has been declared [in the country],” he said.
Reiterating his position which he took in the Supreme Court on Thursday evening, Mr Khan said he was totally unaware of the developments which took place after his arrest and claimed that he had learnt that 40 people had lost their lives during the two-day protests.
Expressing “sadness” over the events that took place when he was in the custody of NAB, Mr Khan stated that “the army is getting maligned because of just one man”.
 
 

During the informal chat, Mr Khan alleged that he was tortured and hit by a baton on his head at the time of his arrest. He, however, described his treatment while he was in custody of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) as “fair”.
Mr Khan said that what happened after his arrest was beyond his control.
“How could I be blamed for those incidents that happened while I was in custody?” he wondered while responding to his critics who were blaming him for violent protests and damage to the private and public property during the countrywide agitation.
Mr Khan also talked to Geo reporter Azaz Syed about his leaked telephonic conversation with party leader Musarrat Jamshed Cheema, stating that he had made the call with a landline number after his arrest as the court had allowed him to talk to his wife Bushra Bibi.
 
 

When the reporter put another question as to why instead of talking to his wife, he talked to a PTI member, Mr Khan said he called Musarrat as his wife did not attend the call.
The PTI chief made some interesting comments when he came face to face with senior journalist Matiullah Jan, who was a harsh critic of the PTI government’s policies and got prominence when he was abducted by unknown persons in broad daylight in Islamabad when Mr Khan was in power.
Mr Khan told the journalist that he as prime minister had ordered for his immediate release during a cabinet meeting when he learnt about his abduction.

4,PDM to stage sit-in outside Supreme Court,MQM undecided over its participation.,"ISLAMABAD: Visibly frustrated by what it called judiciary’s undue facilitation to PTI Chairman Imran Khan, the ruling coalition on Friday announced staging a sit-in outside the Supreme Court on Monday.
While the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) attempted to present a united front, it was still uncertain whether MQM — whicht is not part of PDM but an ally of the ruling coalition — will take part in the demonstration or not.
Addressing a press conference on Friday, PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said the protest will be held “against the behaviour of the Supreme Court”.
“A big sit-in will be staged to express that the Supreme Court is the mother of law but not the mother-in-law,” Mr Rehman said, as he called upon the supporters to reach Islamabad for the sit-in.

MQM undecided over its participation

“Every citizen of the country will reach Islamabad on Monday and will hold a peaceful demonstration outside the Supreme Court,” he added.
Mr Rehman was speaking to the media after a meeting of PDM parties’ heads, also attended by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif from London. The meeting discussed the situation following the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) decision that gave blanket bail to Imran Khan in all his cases.
He said the protest will be peaceful, but warned if anyone “tried to harm us we will retaliate with sticks, fists and slaps.”
“We will try to achieve our goal peacefully but this will change in case of any hurdles,” he said, without specifying who would create the hurdles as PDM itself was in power.
The announcement of the protest has come at a time when Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) has been imposed in Islamabad by the local administration. The section bars the gathering of more than four people at any place.
Mr Rehman said PDM was not expecting the judges to deviate so much from the Constitution that they stop respecting the parliament’s supremacy. 
“The country’s economy, morality, law and the Consti­tution have been put at stake today for Imran Khan and today everyone has to play their role for the sake of democracy,” Mr Rehman said.
When asked about Punjab elections, he said, “The issue of election is different. Taliban were declared traitors for conducting attacks similar to those carried out by PTI workers in the last four days. His [Imran’s] acts do not fall in the category of terrorism but mutiny and treason.” 
‘Indecisive’ MQM
Initially, the PPP and MQM were unclear about their participation in the planned demonstration.
Later, the PPP decided to join the sit-in, the party’s Secretary General Nayyar Bukhari said in a statement. However, MQM was still ambivalent about its support for the plan. A local party leader, Zahid Mehmood, said that a meeting was underway to decide on MQM’s participation.
NA session rescheduled
In a separate development, National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf on Friday rescheduled the sitting slated for 5pm on Monday. According to the NA secretariat, the meeting will be held at 10am instead of 5pm.

5,CJP-led bench to hear Punjab polls review plea on 15th,ECP says change in election programme is its ‘solitary domain’ under Section 58 of Elections Act,"ISLAMABAD: A day after May 14, the date set by the Supreme Court for Punjab Assembly elections, the top court will take up a review petition of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking to revisit its April 4 verdict.
The apex court in its landmark decision last month had set May 14 for the conduct of Punjab Assembly elections after disregarding the ECP’s appointed date of Oct 8. In the same decision, the court stated that since the matter of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly elections had not been adjudicated upon, the petitioner had the permission to approach any forum as deemed appropriate for seeking relief.
Moved through Advocate Sajeel Sheryar Swati, the ECP in its review petition requested the court to recall its April 4 judgement in the interest of justice, arguing that it was per incuriam (lack of jurisdiction) to the constitution. Of the 326 National Assembly seats, 173 and 55 seats are from Punjab and KP, respectively, indicating 72 per cent of the total strength, according to the ECP review petition.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, the bench also comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar will begin hearing the review petition, which agitates that the change of election programme is the solitary domain of the ECP under Section 58 of the Elections Act, 2017.

ECP says change in election programme is its ‘solitary domain’ under Section 58 of Elections Act

Since general elections to the National Assembly are due in near future, with its term completing in August 2023, the ground realities need to be considered in true perspective, according to the petition. 
The ECP says it requires the government machinery that is non-partisan and has no inclination towards any political party to perform its constitutional duties to conduct the general elections honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law. If elections to the NA are held while permanent governments already in place in Punjab and KP, the sanctity, objectivity and fairness of elections to 72pc seats of the national assembly would inevitably be compromised, the petition contends.
The review petition says the question of harmonising Articles 218(3) and 224 as well as the provisions of the Elections Act, 1997 is of the first impression and has not been dealt with by superior courts. It emphasises that the ECP has even been guarded under Article 222 from any intervention in clear words that its power cannot be diluted, whittled away or abridged through parliamentary intervention. 
Instead of Section 58 of the Elections Act, the Supreme Court in its order relied upon Section 57 in order to designate President Arif Alvi as authority for fixing the date where the assemblies stood dissolved by efflux of time, the ECP recalls. 
The petition reminds the court that legislature while enacting Sections 57 and 58 of the Elections Act was cognisant of the fact that situations may arise due to which elections dates are required to be changed.
Citing the 2008 general elections, the petition argues that the ECP keeping in view the exigency and requirement of that time had delayed polls for 40 days. That is why the legislature while enacting Section 58 put overriding phrase “Notwithstanding anything contained in section 57”, at the very start of Section 58(1), knowing it fully well that Section 57 enumerates something that is contrary to what Section 58 would consider as permissible.
The petition emphasises that the courts interpret the law, but they do not rewrite it. As per literal interpretation of the provision of Section 58, change of the election programme or giving a fresh programme — of which poll date is an essential component or stage — is ECP’s domain. Thus, Section 58 overrides anything contained in Section 57 of the Elections Act and is divorced, in its essence, from Section 57. That is a simple, plain and clear effect of the overriding clause and as per the established jurisprudence of the country, the overriding clause takes precedence over the provision containing a contrary view, the review petition maintains.
It argues that the SC under no provision of the constitution or the law could have taken the exercise upon itself to appoint the poll date through April 4 order. The appointing of date or changing it is an executive exercise, and certainly not a judicial exercise, it adds.
