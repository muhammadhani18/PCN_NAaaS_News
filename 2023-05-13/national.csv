1,540 more PTI leaders and workers picked up in Punjab,"So far, 205 cases have been lodged by the Punjab police across the province against the party leaders and workers since May 9.","LAHORE: The Pun­jab police on Friday arrested 540 more leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf wanted in cases lodged against them under the Anti-Terro­rism Act all over the province for carrying out attacks on the Corps Commander House in Lahore, public and private buildings, law enforcement agencies and their vehicles.
Most of the arrests were made through the CCTV cameras of the Safe City Authority and other video recordings from mobile pho­nes and private cameras.
So far, 205 cases have been lodged by the Punjab police across the province against the party leaders and workers since May 9.
On Thursday night, a brief scuffle broke out between the police and PTI workers. Pol­ice stormed the party’s office at the Jail Road for the arrest of workers nominated in the cases registered by various police stations.
According to the re­­ports, the party workers pelted the police with stones but fled when more police force was called for support.
On Friday evening, the police deployment was increa­sed around the residence of the PTI Chairman Imran Khan at Zaman Park following reports that workers were gathering there in large numbers to welcome him after court relief.
Tension mounted in Faisalabad when the lawyers community condemned the police raid at the office of the district bar for the arrest of former provincial minister Ali Afzal Sahi.
The lawyers warned of strong agitation and reaction and dema­nded action against the police.
To defused tension, the Punjab governm­ent made the Faisal­abad SSP Operations officer on special duty who was leading the police raid.
In a statement issued here on Friday, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar said that criminals involv­­ed in attacks on sensitive installations, public and private properties, and police teams did not deserve any sympathy. “These miscreants are being identified and traced through CCTV footage, video recordings and social media posts.” After Friday arrests, the number of detai­n­­ed leaders and suppo­rters had risen to 2,790, the Punjab police said.
He said more than 152 police officers and officials had been injured in the attacks carried out by violent protesters in Punjab.
Of them, he said, 63 officers and personnel were from the provincial capital Lahore, 26 from Faisalabad, 13 from Gujranwala, 29 from Rawa­lpindi, 10 from Attock, six from Mianwali and five from Sialkot.
Apart from this, 72 vehicles used by Punjab police and eight privately owned vehicles were damaged and torched, the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, the PTI has strongly condem­ned the arrest of party leaders and police raid on party’s Jail Road office here. It said po­­lice smashed office fixtures, electronic gadgets and burnt party record. “The Pun­jab police is committing state terrorism in its worst shape,” a PTI spokesman alleged.
The spokesman alle­g­ed that police also sto­le money from a safe ly­ing in the party office.

2,Sanaullah hints  at Imran’s arrest after May 17,Says CJP’s words for PTI chief unbecoming of his stature,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Friday hinted at the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan on or any day after May 17.
Commenting on the Islamabad High Court’s decision which granted a two-week protective bail to the former prime minister in the Al-Qadir Trust case and banned his arrest in any other case till May 17, he said that if the court gave Mr Khan protective bail beyond that period, then he would not be arrested at all.
Talking to private TV channels, the interior minister said that the court orders would be implemented and the PTI leader would not be arrested till May 17, adding that the senior officers had been told to take instructions from the advocate general on the issue.
“If there is a reason for his arrest, then he will be arrested,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that what the PTI did over the last two to three days was intolerable.

Says CJP’s words for PTI chief unbecoming of his stature

“The courts can facilitate them, but as per the law, we will take action against their anti-state and terror activities,” the interior minister said.
Referring to the Supreme Court’s verdict that released Mr Khan and termed his arrest illegal, he said that whatever had happened till now was “unprecedented”.
He said the facilitation being provided to this “ladla (blue-eyed boy)” should then be provided to everyone.
“There is no example of such judicial decisions and means of facilitation are being invented,” the interior minister said.
When asked if the former prime minister would be arrested as PTI workers were involved in vandalising an important installation in Lahore, Mr Sanaullah said: “We have all the evidence from every single day, we have his speeches. The cases have been filed and they are still being filed.”
He said the cabinet had condemned yesterday’s remarks in the Supreme Court and how he had been welcomed after embezzling the huge amount of money.
Mr Sanaullah said there was no proposal to ban the PTI and similarly there was no proposal under consideration of the government to impose an emergency in the country.
The interior minister criticised the chief justice of Pakistan over his exchange of greetings with Mr Khan, who he said had been charged with corruption of Rs60 billion.
He said that remarks made by the CJP were not befitting of his esteemed position, adding that such conversation had put a shadow of partiality over the court’s authority, raising questions about the integrity and fairness of the judiciary.
The interior minister stressed the need for identifying and addressing what he called the ‘fitna’, arguing that failure to do so would plunge the country into anarchy.
He also accused Mr Khan of intentionally destabilising the nation and fostering an atmosphere of chaos and disorder.

3,Seven militants killed in separate operations in Balochistan,"Two soldiers also embraced martyrdom, according to ISPR.","QUETTA: Security forces killed seven militants in separate incidents on Friday in Balochistan, while two soldiers were also martyred, the military’s media wing ISPR said.
In the first incident, security forces killed two militants after an early-morning attack on a Frontier Constabulary camp in the Muslim Bagh town in Qilla Saifullah district.
However, in a gunfight between the two sides that raged on late into the night, two soldiers were martyred and three others injured, the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
It said security forces had continued to “maintain pressure on the terrorists”.
An operation by the security forces was underway “to capture the terrorists who have been cornered into a building complex” while a heavy exchange of fire was also taking place, it said.
Commander of XII Corps Asif Ghafoor, the top army official in the province, “is supervising the security forces operations being conducted at Muslim Bagh area in Balochistan where terrorists have been cornered”, it said.
In the second incident, five militants were killed in a heavy exchange of fire with security forces during an operation in the Hoshab area of Kech district. Security forces also seized a huge quantity of arms and ammunition.
The ISPR said in a statement late on Friday night that between the night of Thursday and Friday, the militants opened fire at a security checkpoint in Hoshab from a distance.
In a follow-up operation, the escaping terrorists were pursued into the nearby mountains of Balore using aerial surveillance. A heavy exchange of fire ensued, during which five militants were killed and a large cache of arms and ammunition was recovered, the ISPR said.
CM condemns attack
Balochistan’s chief minister, Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, condemned the attack on the FC camp and expressed grief over the martyrdom of two soldiers.
In a statement issued on Friday, he said FC soldiers had foiled the attack with bravery and inflicted heavy losses on the assailants. He said the nation was proud of its security forces, who were playing a key role in thwarting militant attacks.
Surge in terrorism
Over the past few months, the country’s security situation has worsened, with militant outfits executing attacks with near impunity.
Since the talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke down in November, the group has intensified its attacks, particularly targeting the police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and areas bordering Afghanistan.
Earlier this month, experts at a discussion warned that the TTP was forging a nexus with Baloch separatists and local militant groups based in KP and Balochistan — a development that will likely exacerbate the already precarious security situation in the country.

4,Living Indus Initiative to cost around $17bn: UN,Project represents a roadmap for Pakistan’s future,"ISLAMABAD: The United Nations says the Living Indus Initiative (LII), the biggest climate initiative in Pakistan’s history which is more than just a one-off response to the climate carnage of 2022 floods, will cost around $17 billion. 
Backed by the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan and the buy-in from across the UN country team, the LII represents a road map for Pakistan’s future and a blueprint for building more resilient communities and long-lasting livelihoods, reveals a new UN document made available to Dawn on Friday.
Led by the government with support from the UN, donors, private sector and civil society, the LII focuses on restoring the ecological health of the Indus River Basin while consolidating projects that will build communities’ resilience and forge sustainable livelihoods.
The document says the cost of inaction is far more and the list of interventions provides opportunities at every level of investment suitable to a range of budgetary constraints. 

Project represents a roadmap for Pakistan’s future

“Indeed, the energy, vision and commitment of Pakistan’s youth is the single greatest reason for hope that the goal of the LII is within reach. The time for discussion is over, and the time to act is now,” the document claims.
The Living Indus Initiative is at the core of the risk-informed 2023-2027 United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework — a key feature of the UN reform that enables the resident coordinator-led UN country team to implement solutions that bridge immediate humanitarian response with long-term sustainable development interventions.
A large part of the impact of climate change on Pakistan happens through its impact on the Indus River system. In the upper Indus Basin, accelerated glacial melting will increase the risks of dangerous glacial lake outburst floods. The twin pressures of global warming and environmental degradation threaten glaciers as the critical source of inflows into the Indus River system.
As a result, flows are likely to first increase to a certain point known as ‘peak water’, a level at which glacier melt-water flow would reach its maximum. After that, flows are likely to decline. 
According to an estimate, the ‘peak water’ of the Indus could be reached as early as in three decades.
In the lower Indus Basin, global warming and associated sea level rise threaten the livelihoods of people living in coastal cities, as well as the sustainability of coastal ecosystems. 
Over the last two centuries, the Indus delta has shrunk by an alarming 92 per cent. It is estimated that by 2050, a further 2.73pc of the delta will be lost due to sea water intrusion, affecting about one per cent of the population.
According to some models, Karachi could witness a sea level rise of as much as 15cm in only the next 20 years putting large tracts of populated land and millions of inhabitants in peril. 
Sea level rise and increases in the frequency and severity of coastal storms are also expected to exacerbate seawater intrusion into the delta and into coastal groundwater.
The Indus is the backbone of Pakistan’s agricultural economy, and the country has already lost an average of 4 per cent of the GDP due to water-related economic impacts — inadequate water supply and sanitation, flood damages and water scarcity in agriculture. 
According to the document, Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate challenge is likely to become more severe in the future both in absolute and (globally) comparative terms.

5,Party leaders hail ‘historic day’ as Imran gets bail,Ask govt to refrain from taking any unlawful action against PTI chief,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders welcomed the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) decision to grant bail to party chief Imran Khan in all cases and termed Friday a ‘historic day’. 
Through various statements, the party leaders hailed the court’s decision and declared that truth had triumphed.
They claimed that the PDM government had falsely implicated Mr Khan in fabricated cases after failing to find any corruption case against him.
The government should refrain from engaging in any unlawful actions against the PTI chief, they said.
In a special message to the workers on Friday, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail said it was a great day as the truth emerged triumphant.

Ask govt to refrain from taking any unlawful action against PTI chief

Mr Ismail requested people to join the former prime minister on his journey to Lahore. He also urged party workers to gather at the Islamabad toll plaza to welcome their leader warmly.
Farrukh Habib, PTI’s central information secretary, also urged party workers and supporters to join Mr Khan on the journey from Islamabad to Lahore.
He said party workers and supporters would also be present with their leader at Mr Khan’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore.
He said it was a need of the hour to make a foolproof security arrangement for the former prime minister, adding that the “fascist regime” should refrain from engaging in any illegal action. 
He advised the government to stop “spreading chaos and anarchy in the country anymore”.
Mr Habib said the government’s all plots and tricks had failed, as the IHC even barred the police from arresting Mr Khan under sections 3 and 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order.
Another PTI leader, Dr Iftikhar Durrani, urged party supporters to continue their peaceful protests until Mr Khan reached a safe and secure location.
In a statement, he said all PTI organisations would offer funeral prayers in absentia for workers and supporters killed during violent protests that erupted after Mr Khan’s arrest on Tuesday.
PTI leader Dr Shahbaz Gill said it was now the time to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the fight against this “cabal of thieves” to get Imran Khan released from the “illegal detention”.
He urged PTI workers and supporters to remain vigilant, as the “gang of thieves could arrest Mr Khan in any other fake and fabricated case, as a plan to re-arrest him in a new case was prepared”.
It was a decisive phase in the country’s history, he said, urging party supporters to continue peaceful protests.
Mr Gill said the “imported government” had no strategy other than imposing an emergency and shutting down the internet service.

6,Pakistan has world’s most ineffective governance: Miftah,"Former finance minister says country suffers from ""elite capture"".","ONDON: Former finance minister and estranged PML-N leader Miftah Ismail on Friday delivered a presentation at an event in London, where he spoke about the pitfalls of elite capture in Pakistan and how these are represented across the spheres of business, politics, judiciary, military and bureaucracy.
The event was jointly organised by Bloomsbury Pakistan, SOAS Pakistan Discussion Forum and SOAS ICOP Student Society.
At the beginning of his talk, Mr Ismail spoke at length about the challenges faced by the country, and the fundamental issues that are keeping Pakistan from becoming an economically robust country that is part of the global supply chain.
Mr Ismail pointed to the vast difference between the elite schools of the country and the remainder of the matric and government schools across the country, pointing out that nearly all the senior judges of the Supreme Court and half of the cabinet during Imran Khan’s tenure were from Aitchison College. 

Former finance minister says country suffers from ‘elite capture’

He said because of the huge gap between the quality of education given at public and private elite schools, whether an individual speaks English or not becomes a gatekeeping function.
“I believe in free markets, but that doesn’t work in Pakistan where my son, who goes to the best university in the world that money can pay for, is competing with my driver’s son whose options for education are limited,” he said.
He also criticised the structure of the political class, saying that families dominate politics and that the family ceiling is the glass ceiling. He also pointed out the elite capture of the industrial sector, where he said “10 groups control 38pc of the industry”.
“Pre-nationalisation, if there was concentration of wealth in the country, today it has not lessened. The faces [of the elite] have also not changed.”
Mr Ismail said, “The people who were the richest in Pakistan 50 years ago are still the same. In America, it’s no longer just the Rockefellers and du Ponts who are rich. You have people like Bill Gates. Unfortunately, in Pakistan, nothing changes”.
He pointed to the bureaucracy and military, which he said draw from the middle class but eventually at the senior officer level perpetuate the same culture of elite capture.
“The military officers live a very separate life from the ones that jawans live,” he said.
He said together all these groups “maximise their privileges”.
“The Pakistani state is ineffective because the elite are happy the way they are. We have the most ineffective governance in the world,” he said.
Mr Ismail said that the circular debt in Pakistan has been worse off after every government. “The country has seen martial law, democracy, hybrid, very hybrid, but one thing we haven’t seen is improvement.”
He pointed to the country’s rapidly growing population as one of its most compelling problems, and said every government has failed to tackle it.
He also said that one major factor keeping the country from being an economic success is terrorism. 
“From all airlines coming to Pakistan, we have gone to no one even wanting their crew here overnight. You don’t see foreigners in Pakistan, if they don’t visit our factories and shops how will they buy our products? That’s why Pakistan is left out of the global supply chain.”
To achieve economic growth, Mr Ismail said Pakistan must have a “governing philosophy”. 
He added, “When the sugar industry or textile industry asks for subsidies, how does the government decide whether to give it?” 
“The government should ask: Will it be conducive to economic growth and will it help with social justice? If we do this right, we will create a Pakistan we can be proud of.”

8,Military rules out martial law,DG ISPR also dismisses reports of army officials resigning and defying Gen Asim Munir.,"ISLAMABAD: Ruling out any possibility of imposing martial law in the country in the wake of  violent protest by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the military spokesman on Friday rejected news that made rounds in the social media that some top ranking army officials have resigned and disobeyed Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir.

He said despite internal disturbance and external conspiracies, armed forces of the country were united.
He said no army official had tendered his resignation and no order of the COAS had been disobeyed.
 
 

He said army leadership believed in the continuity of democracy even in the prevailing deadlock between the government and PTI.
“There is no question of imposition of martial law,” Maj-Gen Chaudhry reiterated.
