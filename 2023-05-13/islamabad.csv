Mr Khurshid had not only been visibly active in Lahore and Islamabad wherever the PTI chief was present, but a large number of PTI leaders too had taken shelter in the GB House Islamabad to escape arrest after May 9 when a crackdown was launched on the party.
The CM GB left for Skardu on Friday morning and sources in his government told Dawn that he was less likely to participate in any political activity, including in mainland Pakistan, and also to discourage agitation or protests in GB.
“Whatever the reason was, Mr Khurshid left for GB before the court appearance of the PTI chief and he told the same to Imran Khan during their meeting on Thursday night,” said a senior official of the GB government.
The situation became serious after Islamabad police laid a siege to the GB House in F-5 on Thursday morning restricting any outsider to go in while the CM along with his three cabinet members and a legislator got stranded inside.
Those who were inside the GB House included Javed Ali Manwa, Finance Minister, Raja Nasir Ali Khan Maqpon, Minister of Tourism  and Haji Shah Baig, Minister for Excise and Taxation, Zakat and Ushr, along with Nawaz Naji, Member GB Assembly.
While local police personnel posted outside the GB House maintained that they were to prevent the movement of any outsider into the building, rumours spread in the city that the CM GB had been placed under house arrest under Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance’s Section 16.
Talking to Dawn, a senior official of the ICT administration said that the federal government had asked the GB chief minister to proceed to his jurisdiction and perform his official duties. If he continued to stay in Islamabad and remained active in local politics, legal action could be taken against him by the federal government through the governor of GB.
In the wee hours of Thursday, the capital police and law enforcement agencies reached GB House where PTI leaders, including Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Maleeka Bukhari and Musarrat Cheema, had taken shelter to avoid arrest.
However, after negotiations with the authorities, the PTI leaders came out of the premises and were arrested.

The participants highlighted that both Pakistan and India put stringent preconditions for any dialogue including Pakistan’s demand to reverse India’s unilateral decision to reverse the status of Indian Occupied Kashmir and India’s insistence on prevention of cross-border terrorism. The panelists highlighted that the Parliament should be the nucleus of the decisions pertaining to Pakistan’s relations with India and other neighbors.

According to sources, 493 PTI activists had been detained by Islamabad police since May, 9; five of them were released after no evidence of their involvement in violence was found while three others had obtained pre-arrest bail.
On the other hand, the police and quick response force (QRF) remained on high alert while patrolling was increased around sensitive installations in the garrison city.

6,Srinagar Highway remains no-go area for citizens third day running,"Police, paramilitary troops resort to teargas shelling to disperse PTI protesters, bid to attack police station foiled","ISLAMABAD: Clashes between Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters and law enforcement agencies continued for the third consecutive day at different points on Srinagar Highway on Friday.
The highway remained closed to the public and clouds of teargas used by police against protesters could be seen from far away.
A law and order situation erupted at G-10 near Islamabad High Court (IHC), Police Lines Chowk G-11 and G-13 at around 10am and continued till sunset, police officers said. 
Police and paramilitary troops used massive anti-riot gear, including teargas shelling, to disperse the PTI protesters, but their efforts failed to bear fruit.
During the clashes, supplies of anti-riot gear were called by the police and private and official vehicles loaded with teargas and rubber bullet cartons reached there. One of the vehicles caught fire after a shell went off when a policeman was sitting inside the vehicle in G-13.

However, the police claimed that the protesters set the vehicle on fire. According to police officers, such supplies were always kept away from protesters and provided to the security personnel from the side which was under their control.
A gathering of protesters also tried to attack the Sangjani police station, however, the police defended the premises and foiled the attack, the officers said. The police also arrested scores of protesters from different localities.
The PTI chief was brought to Islamabad High Court amid tight security after taking him out from the headquarters from the backdoor and driving his vehicle from an unusual route.
After the hearing of the cases, Mr Khan remained inside the court as law and order situation remained disturbed on Srinagar Highway and Chungi No 26. At around 8:30pm, gunshots were fired near G-10, G-11 and G-13.
As a result, senior officers rushed to the court and combed and scanned the area besides disallowing the PTI chief from moving out, the officers said.
During the last three days, over 550 workers and supporters of the PTI have been arrested and put behind bars at different police installations, the officers said.
Six more cases were also registered against the party leaders, workers and supporters for creating law and order on Thursday.
The cases were registered at Secretariat, Kohsar, Ramna, Shams Colony, Noon and Koral police stations under section 353, 186, 341, 188, 147,149, 324, 148, 427, 436, 440, 506ii, 395, 342 and 436 of the PPC against over 950 people. Section 7-ATA was also added to cases registered at the Ramna and Shms Colony police stations.
Meanwhile, PTI Islamabad President Ali Nawaz Awan said the “fascist government crossed all limits of barbarism and cruelties as the Islamabad police resorted to using teargas against people performing Friday prayers.”
Talking to media on Friday, he said the police fired tear gas shells on “peaceful PTI supporters who had gathered at G-13 to welcome their leader Imran Khan.”
He said such excesses could not even be imagined in Palestine and Kashmir. Mr Awan said the Islamabad police were deliberately creating an atmosphere of confrontation.
He said let the media come and see as to who were peaceful and who were using force, adding the PTO supporters were being prevented from holding peaceful protests which was their fundamental and constitutional rights.
Mr Awan claimed that not a single activist had taken the law into their hands, questioning who gave the right to Islamabad police to use force against the peaceful protesters.

7,MCI postpones controversial auction of kiosks,ISLAMABAD: The apparently “ill-planned” initiative of Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Metropolitan...,"ISLAMABAD: The apparently “ill-planned” initiative of Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) of auctioning vending points (kiosks) in various locations of the city saw a setback as the auction has been postponed.
Following a petition filed by Islamabad High Court (IHC), which pleaded for stay by stating that MCI in the absence of a local government setup could not take any major decision such as auction of kiosks, the MCI on Friday decided to postpone the auction, it had planned for May 15, 16 and 17.
The petition was filed by president of All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran Ajmal Baloch through his counsel. During hearing of the case on Friday before IHC Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, the state counsel told the court that auction has been postponed for indefinite period.
“Learned state counsel has tendered appearance and seeks some time to file a report and para-wise comments. 
“He has assured that on account of the imposition of Section 144 CrPC in the Islamabad Capital Territory, the auction which was proposed to be held on Monday, 15.05.2023 to 17.05.2023 has been postponed indefinitely. Let report and para-wise comments be filed within a period of two weeks,” read the court order. The civic agency was all set to auction 200 vending points on May 15, 16 and 17, out of the total 1,800 planned for a 10-year lease.
“Yes, today during court hearing, a counsel from MCI/state told the court that because of section 144, the auction may not be held. Technically, there is no stay, but the statement of state counsel has been made part of the judgment, therefore, we cannot hold auction as per planned dates,” said an officer of MCI.
It is relevant to note here that the local government completed its five year tenure in February 2021 and the affairs of MCI are being looked after by deputy commissioner Islamabad as administrator.
Last year, the MCI had tried to outsource six cricket grounds of Islamabad, but the move was short-lived as a petition, which stated that MCI administrator could not outsource playground since this was the domain of the elected mayor, requested for deferment till the local government elections. The court had granted stay orders in favour of the petitioner, who had challenged the decision. This time too, MCI has faced a setback when it decided that auction of kiosks could not be held on scheduled dates.
The initiative of auctioning kiosks has also been facing criticism and being termed “ill-planned” by many as open auction will offer nothing for small businessmen and they would not be able to compete with business tycoons during the auction.  Therefore, technically, the poor segment of society will get no benefit from this auction and they will be helpless before business tycoons while submitting bids.
Vendors have been demanding that instead of open auction, the CDA should allot vending points through computerised balloting in a transparent manner under controlled rate.
They said that there should be controlled and fixed price of vending points and the same should be allotted after computerised balloting. But, open auction means, the vending points in posh sectors like F-6 and F-6, may get bids of millions of rupees. 
Earlier, there were over 450 kiosks in Islamabad including licensed ones and illegal, but the MCI after cancelling licences in one go, demolished all of them some years ago. 
Later on, many kiosk owners reconstructed their kiosks, but CDA did not own them and since the past few years, owners of kiosks are being informed by CDA that new kiosks with proper designs will be constructed.

Office bearers of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association (Rawalpindi chapter), while talking to journalists on Friday said that around 130 flour mills operating in the Rawalpindi district, in which over 50 are in Taxila and Wah have not received wheat as wheat brought from other districts of Punjab is being confiscated by motorway and district police while local wheat producers are not selling their wheat on official rates.
They claimed that in the open market, wheat farmers are not ready to sell their wheat for less than Rs6,000 per maund, while the Punjab government has fixed the official price for purchase at Rs4,900.
They were of the view that reduction in quota of flour mills and the abolition of flour subsidy had already created a flour crisis in Rawalpindi district.
Since Rawalpindi is not a wheat-producing region, flour mills established here meet the flour needs of the people by procuring wheat from Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Bahawalpur and Sargodha and the provincial government has banned the movement of wheat from other districts, rendering owners to close down mills. They were of the view that due to the closure, thousands of workers and labourers working in these flour mills are also at a risk of losing their jobs. They said that the flour price will further go up if the government fails to intervene and ensure the supply of wheat to mills.
Flour Mills’ Association Central Chairman Asim Raza Ahmed said that Punjab food department is not supplying wheat while wheat procured by mill owners from central Punjab is being confiscated on the pretext of “smuggling”. Local wheat growers are not ready to sell their wheat on the official rate, he said, adding that the government and administration knows that Rawalpindi is a wheat deficient district and all the over 100 flour mills operating in the area depended upon official or procured wheat.
He added that smuggling meant taking wheat from Punjab to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Huge financial losses by flour millers are being incurred as around 130 mills operating in the district have been shut down due to lack of the commodity.
If the government does not release the government quota to the mills soon or does not give subsidy on wheat like the previous periods, then in one to two weeks, residents of Rawalpindi, Islamabad and adjoining areas will crave for every bag of flour.
A member of the association Sheikh Mohammad Saeed said that unnecessary restrictions have created a crisis.

According to World Health Organisation (WHO), nurses and midwives make up more than half of the health workforce in WHOs Eastern Mediterranean region.
However, the region accounts for 17pc of the global shortage of 5.9 million nurses, according to the WHO report on “State of the world’s nursing 2020: investing in education, jobs and leadership.”
The region has the second lowest density of nurses among WHO regions at 15.6 nurses per 10,000 population, ranging from less than one to 81 per 10,000 population.
The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of ensuring a sufficient number of the health workforce in building resilient health systems. We must address the shortage in the health workforce, especially in nurses and midwives in our region to raise up to the challenges.
“As we progress towards universal health coverage (UHC) and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets, including those related to education, gender and economic growth, within the rapidly changing global health context, it is timely and imperative to invest in the nursing workforce,” reiterated Dr Ahmed Al-Mandahri,
WHO’s regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean.
“We must respect nurses rights and well-being to secure global health.”
WHO estimated that an additional nine million nurses and midwives are needed if the world is to achieve UHC by 2030.
In the Eastern Mediterranean region, despite high-level political commitment and continued efforts to strengthen nursing, progress has been slow. In 2019, the regional committee adopted a call for action to accelerate efforts to strengthen nursing and midwifery.
Ever since some progress has been made, however, countries still need more qualified and competent nurses to effectively address increasing health challenges.
“Countries must prioritise investing in nurses based on measurable, transparent and realistic actions to build a highly qualified and resilient nursing workforce that can respond to the changing contexts and needs of the population and ensure health for all by all.
“Our nurses face many challenges, including working under extremely difficult conditions with security concerns, as many countries in our region are experiencing protracted crises. We must think innovatively and propose concrete actions to address these challenges,’ Dr Al-Mandhari stated.
“On International Nurses Day, while acknowledging the work of nurses in our region and beyond, WHO and its partners call on all world leaders to invest in nurses in advancing UHC and health security. Nurses deserve our solidarity, support, and recognition.

Khana-i-Farhang Director General Rahmanzad Framerz inaugurated the exhibition.
More than 50 works of various calligraphers including Khawaja Mohammad Hussain, Mohammad Azim Iqbal and Mohammad Younus Rumi were placed in the exhibition. Addressing the opening ceremony, Mr Framerz said that Hussain Tahrir is our Islamic cultural heritage.
At the beginning of the Islamic civilisation, importance was placed on preservation of the word. As a result of the deep attachment of Muslims to the promotion and publication of sciences and arts, the art of calligraphy gained extraordinary importance and the word acquired the same aesthetic value and status as a picture. 
The chief guest described the art of calligraphy as an important heritage of Islamic civilisation and said that this art is similar to the Holy Quran.
RAC Director Waqar Ahmad said that Islamic calligraphy is the legacy of Muslims. 
The tradition of calligraphy is centuries old and our calligraphers are the trustees of this tradition, who have kept this art alive. 
We should focus on teaching our children creative literature along with formal education. 
The arts council is taking many steps to promote Islamic calligraphy for which classes have been arranged. 
Assistant Director Mohammad Sulaiman said that there is immense talent in Pakistan, which only needs to be developed. 
Pakistani children can make the country proud through participating in calligraphy competitions around the world. Shields and certificates of appreciation were distributed to all calligraphers at the end of the exhibition.

12,Author gives insight into process of writing fiction,"ISLAMABAD: A thought-provoking conversation with Spanish author Javier Moro, accompanied by appetising delicacies...","ISLAMABAD: A thought-provoking conversation with Spanish author Javier Moro, accompanied by appetising delicacies from the country, offered insight into the art of writing fiction.
The author ofFive Past Midnight in BhopalandThe Red Sari – a biography of Sonia Gandhi– was guest speaker at a programme organised by the Embassy of Spain in conjunction with the Asian Study Group titled, ‘On Writing Narrative Fiction’.
Several of his books are set in the subcontinent includingPassion India. Moro is the nephew of Dominique LaPeirre, co-author ofFreedom at Midnight, who initiated him into the craft of narrative nonfiction.
Moro told his listeners, a select group of diplomats and local guests that he wrote real stories and did not like fantasy, sci-fi, and black novels. He fell in love with existing stories to pass on that passion to the reader. He said he used fiction to give life to dead pages of history and transmit emotions. He chose writing over becoming a producer and working in movies.
“I spend three to four years researching subjects, after being convinced that their stories need to be told,” he said adding, “Sonia Gandhi is a fabulous story, an Italian house wife with absolutely no ambition at all, who hated to talk in public, was extremely shy, detested social life yet ended up being the most powerful woman in India. What a story. I had to write it though I had all the problems in the world because she did not want anyone to write her story.”
The author said he focused on the intimate details – the smell of the house, who they invited for dinner, who cooked, where did they buy the food – the atmosphere in the house and so on as according to him, these details brought life to text.
At the same time, he said he faced extreme difficulty writing because her kin would not talk to him, and he was also threatened with legal action. The book drew significant criticism for months, protests, his effigy burnt, his posters splashed with blood, while it was successfully released in other countries. “Later, the book became a huge hit,” Moro said.
Elaborating on problems writing about his characters, Moro said it was rare that the opinion one had of him or herself coincided with the writer’s and that led to problems.
He read out passages fromPassion Indiaabout Anita Delgado, a beautiful, but barely literate, Spanish teenager, who while dancing in a Madrid nightclub, caught the eye of a visiting Indian Maharaja Jagatjit Singh.
Moro fell in love with the city of Bhopal, while writingFive Past Midnight in Bhopal. “I had the most wonderful writing and research experiences. Bhopal will always be in my heart, stained by a terrible accident, a city of poets,” he said.
He said he always wanted to write about Benazir Bhutto, who was an image of Pakistan in the West. “She was such a big character. I was intrigued by her story. There isn’t an intimate book on her. But it was complicated and then she was assassinated. So I decided to write about Sonia Gandhi. But I would have loved that experience,” the author said.
