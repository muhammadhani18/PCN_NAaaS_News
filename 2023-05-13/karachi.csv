• Peoples Bus Service to be launched in every district
• MMA member says 134 citizens killed during muggings in Karachi in 2023                                   
KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was on Friday informed that the federal government had in principal agreed to hand over the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) project to the provincial government and efforts were on to execute the project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Speaking on the floor of the house, Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, however, said the project had not so far been formally handed over to the provincial government, adding that the project was still under the control of the Pakistan Railway. 
“We will immediately start work on the project after its formal handover to us,” he said.
The highly ambitious plan to restart the 44-km KCR remains a pipe dream as the work on the first two underpasses in Gulshan-i-Iqbal was stopped after the federal government decided to bring the project under CPEC.
Initiated in 1964, the old KCR route started from Drigh Road and ended in downtown Karachi. After suffering losses for years, it ceased operations in 1999.
While responding to a supplementary question by Rana Ansar, the parliamentary party leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, the information minister said that the KCR was the backbone of the city’s traffic and the provincial government was taking all-out measures to resolve the traffic issue in the city.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had decided to revive the KCR on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis with heavy subsidies to the private partner by the government. However, the change in the regime led to change in financial theme of the project as the incumbent Pakistan Democratic Alliance-led government abandoned the public-private partnership (PPP) mode and decided to seek Chinese investment for the project under CPEC.
Mr Memon told the lawmakers that the provincial government had decided to launch the Peoples Bus Service (PBS) in every district of the province.
He said the provincial government was giving subsidy in the fares of PBS as the normal fare was Rs50 in Karachi while Rs100 was charged on the routes exceeding 30km.
To another supplementary question, he conceded that the land of transport departments at different places in the province had been illegally occupied.
He said the transport department had informed him cattle pens had been established on 50 acres of the department’s land in Karachi by Leader of the Opposition Haleem Adil Sheikh.
In reply to a question by Grand Democratic Alliance’s (GDA) Nand Kumar Goklani, he said he was not aware if department’s land in Sanghar was occupied. “I assure you that I will get the occupied land vacated,” he told the GDA lawmaker.
Call attention notices
In reply to a call attention notice given by Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s lone MPA Syed Abdur Rasheed, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that the law and order situation was much better than the past days.
He said that an operation was also being conducted in the riverine area of Sindh and on the Punjab border, adding that a high-level meeting had been held to curb crimes and drug menace.
Speaking on his call attention, the MMA lawmaker said that over 130 citizens were killed in 2023 so far by armed robbers. He alleged that instead of maintaining the law and order, police were busy in ‘managing’ the local government polls for the ruling party.
The MMA member said that 134 people had been killed during muggings in Karachi in 2023 and over 72,000 vehicles were snatched or stolen. He said the robbers killed 31 citizens in January, 34 in February, 32 in March and 28 in April, adding that nine people fell victim to street crime in the first 11 days of May.
“What the steps are taken by the Sindh government and law enforcement agencies to protect the life and property of the citizens?” he asked.
The opposition member said that on one hand people were being killed by robbers while on the other, the entire police department was ‘engaged’ in stealing the mandate of Karachi. “Sindh police is playing the role of political workers,” he alleged.
In response to a call attention notice by GDA’s Golkani, the parliamentary minister said that a massive crackdown had been launched against hoarders to control the prices of essential commodities.
The GDA MPA said that there was a massive increase in the prices of flour, sugar, chicken and other daily use commodities in the province. He asked the minister to inform the house about the reasons of recent price hike.
Meanwhile, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed The Sindh Physiotherapy Council 2022
Later, Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani adjourned the house till Monday.

Your safety and well-being come first, and that’s why this decision was taken. We know this is a crucial time in your academic journey, and the disruption caused by the current situation is not ideal. We want to reassure you that we are doing everything we can to ensure that Cambridge students can continue their education journey without any interruption.”

4,"PTA issued notice on plea against internet, social media restrictions","IT & telecom ministry, interior secretary told to file comments by 19th","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday issued notices to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and other respondents on a petition filed against the government decision to suspend mobile internet services and restrict access to social media platforms.
A two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh, also put the federation through ministry of information technology & telecom, interior secretary and Sindh chief secretary on notice with a direction to file comments till May 19.
Advocate Hyder Raza petitioned the SHC and submitted that former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested on the premises of the Islamabad High Court on May 9, triggering protests across the country and that the respondents had completely suspended mobile internet service throughout the country for an indefinite period and access to social media platforms had also been blocked by the PTA.
He argued that broadband internet services were also either broken down or functioning at a painstakingly slow speed.

The petitioner contended that he had severely been affected by such measures as he was unable to access the internet or WhatsApp freely, which was disturbing the work as well as communication with his clients. He said that his children were also unable to access YouTube.
He also stated that such measures on part of the PTA were unimaginable in the present age as the whole world revolved around the use of technology, which was essential in daily lives of almost all citizens of the country.
He maintained that the livelihood of many people depended on the use of the internet, including people earning a living through online food delivery and ride-hailing applications and they had been severely affected by this issue. Such suspension was directly affecting their right to live and conduct trade and business, he added.
The access to e-learning platforms, online meetings and interviews was also affected as the internet speed was extremely slow, affecting the education and job prospects of citizens, he said.
The petitioner argued that suspension of mobile internet services and blockage to social media platforms were illegal and unconstitutional, being against the fundamental rights and several other constitutional provisions including Articles 9, 15, 18, 19 and 19-A of the Constitution.
He sought directives for the respondents to restore mobile internet services as well as access to social media and restoration of broadband internet at normal speed.

5,PPP claims ‘winning’ numbers for election of Karachi mayor,Bilawal to address I.I. Chundrigar Road rally today.,"

PPP leader Saeed Ghani (centre) speaks at a press conference on Friday.—PPI

 
KARACHI: For the first time since the results of recent local government elections have emerged, the Pakistan Peoples Party has came up with calculations of the possible formation of the upcoming City Council to prove the prospects of its success in the crucial mayoral election and announced that its nominee would be the next mayor of Karachi.  
The claim came on Friday from the top leadership of the party’s Karachi chapter which was confident that it’s only a matter of time when a ‘Jiyala mayor’ would be assuming the key office of the city local bodies system heralding the return of the PPP in electoral mandate of the metropolis.  
“With 155 members in the soon-to-be-formed City Council, we are sure to get our nominee elected as the next mayor of Karachi,” said Sindh Labour and Human Resources Minister and PPP Karachi president Saeed Ghani while addressing a press conference here at the Sindh Assembly.  
“Any party needs to have minimum of 184 members in the council for getting its nominee elected as the city mayor. This requirement would come down to 183 if Firdous Shamim Naqvi of the PTI decides to vacate his seat in the council. Amid all this, one should not forget that it’s already decided that 14 council members of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and four members of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazal) would support our candidate for the mayoral seat.” 

Bilawal to address I.I. Chundrigar Road rally today

He was also hopeful that Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan, which has one seat in the City Council, would support the PPP in the mayoral election.  
Apart from the calculation of the seats and partnership with the parties having mandate, he said, the ruling PPP during the past few years deserved to become the largest single party in the local government polls following ‘record development projects’ and keeping ‘focus of its efforts on Karachi and its people’.  
“It was the trust of the people which converted into votes and we won the majority,” said Mr Ghani.  
“Another thing which proved the politics of Karachi and its people is that they have rejected the politics of divide. They don’t want ethnicity to grow among them which has already caused so much damage to this city and the country. Our policy of uniting people and bringing them closer made us successful.” 
Rally planned today to celebrate victory
Following the ‘historic success’, the minister said that party was staging a rally on I.I. Chundrigar Road on Saturday to celebrate their overwhelming victory in the recently held local government polls, which would be addressed by PPP chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.  
He said the stage of the rally would be set near the National Bank’s head office while rallies comprising PPP supporters and activists would enter the venue from Shaheen Complex appealing Karachiites to participate in big numbers.  
He also urged the parties which participated in the recent by-polls and won mandate to look forward and join hands for development of the city.  
He also asked them to respect the mandate of others instead of levelling ‘false’ allegations.  
“The PPP has always enjoyed support in Karachi as a political force,” he said. “Even we had serious reservations over several issues before and after the polls but we ignored them all for the sake of larger interest of the city. We expect the same maturity from other parties.”

11,"March held over ‘famine-like’  situation in Thatta, Makli",Protesters say water is available but being sold to affluent people,"THATTA: Activists of various political parties, nationalist groups and civil society organisations on Friday intensified their protest against water crisis in Thatta and Makli on the 50th day of their drive. They held a four kilometer-march on foot and held a sit-in on the Thatta-Makli section of the highway.  
The march was led by ‘Save Thatta Forum’ president Jamshed Qureshi, general secretary Dilawar Shaikh and other office-bearers including Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Comrade Hafiz Abbasi and Khalid Mumbai.
Speaking to the participants, the leaders said that residents of Thatta and Makli had been holding protests on a daily basis for the last 50 days to draw the attention of the authorities concerned towards the crisis but without any response as yet. They said they decided to intensify their drive and warned that several hundred residents of the two cities would proceed to Karachi and hold their protest in front of the Sindh Assembly if remedial measures were not taken within a week to address the issue.  
Jamshed Qureshi told the media at the sit-in venue that over 200,000 souls of the Thatta and Makli had been facing a famine-like situation for weeks despite the fact that drinking and irrigation water was being supplied to certain areas on the outskirts of the two towns.

Protesters say water is available but being sold to affluent people

He said his forum had been holding demonstrations, rallies and sit-ins at different places on a daily basis but neither the elected representatives nor the administrations were paying any heed. 
Dilawar Shaikh said that the ‘tanker mafia’ in connivance with some influential figures of the area and certain corrupt irrigation and municipal officials was involved in depriving the local population of its share in water. 
“Two main tributaries have regularly been supplying Keenjhar Lake’s water to several towns, like Jungshahi, Gujjo, Gharo and Dhabeji, on the outskirts of Thatta but the city itself and Makli town were either getting meagre or no supplies for the last six-seven weeks,” he said. He alleged that local irrigation officials were actually selling water to owners of farm houses, lagoons, industries and fish farms as well as influential land owners.
He deplored that despite the continuing protests being organised by the forum, the authorities concerned did not make any arrangement for drinking water supply to Thatta and Makli population even on Eid days. He regretted that elected representatives of the district and towns were also not paying any heed to the affected families’ distress calls amid an aggravating famine-like situation.
Sadiq Ali Memon, the Special Assistant to the CM and ruling Pakistan Peoples Party’s Thatta president, acknowledged that the area was getting far less water supplies against its requirement. 
He told Dawn that Thatta and Makli were getting supplies through the Udero Lal branch, Sakro branch and KB Feeder. “A crisis-like situation had started emerging after the public health engineering department transferred the water supply system to the local government institutions,” he said, adding that the latter’s performance in running the system in this area appeared poor.
He said that by improving the rotation system and gravitational force of water (by carrying out desilting of water channels) could help overcome the crisis.
Obhayo Khan Khushik — an eminent water expert and author of many books on Indus water — told Dawn that the situation was a ‘man-made crisis’ caused miserable failure of administration as well as the irrigation, revenue and local government departments.
He lamented that there was an army of officials and other employees regularly drawing their salaries but none of them were found discharging his duties diligently. The officials concerned, including those of the Thatta Municipal Committee and Makli Town could be found in their offices except for the days when salaries were disbursed and budgetary allocations were released.
He suggested proper repair and renovation of installations to ensure proper flows in the Jam branch, 
Allah Khai Naali and Chach Lower tributary to overcome the crisis.
