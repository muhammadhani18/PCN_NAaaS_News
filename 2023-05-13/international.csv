0,US to bolster ‘defensive posture’ in Gulf amid Iran’s ‘threats’,The move comes after Iran seized a second oil tanker in a week in Gulf waters earlier this month.,"WASHINGTON: The Pentagon will bolster defensive posture in the Gulf region because Iran has increased its attacks on commercial shipping in recent months, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday.
In the past two years, Iran has “harassed, attacked or interfered with the navigational rights” of 15 internationally flagged commercial vessels, Kirby said.
“Today, the Department of Defence will be making a series of moves to bolster our defensive posture in the Gulf,” Kirby told reporters in a briefing.
Kirby said US Central Command would provide details in coming days.
The move comes after Iran seized a second oil tanker in a week in Gulf waters earlier this month, and the State Department called for its release in the latest escalation in a series of actions against commercial vessels in Gulf waters since 2019.
The Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet of the US Navy said on May 3 the Panama-flagged oil tanker Niovi was seized by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy while passing through the Strait of Hormuz.
The incident came days after Iran seized a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman.
Kirby said the US strongly condemns actions that threaten and interfere with commercial shipping, and will not allow foreign powers to jeopardise navigating Middle East waterways.
“We have seen repeated Iranian threats, armed seizures and attacks against commercial shippers who are exercising their navigational rights and freedoms in international waterways,” he said.
About a fifth of the world’s crude oil and oil products passes through the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point between Iran and Oman, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa.

1,‘Largest’ cosmic blast puzzles astronomers,A fireball 100 times the size of our Solar System began blazing three years ago,"PARIS: Astronomers said on Friday they have identified the “largest” cosmic explosion ever observed, a fireball 100 times the size of our Solar System that suddenly began blazing in the distant universe three years ago.
While the astronomers offered what they think is the most likely explanation for the explosion, they emphasised that more research was needed to understand the puzzling phenomenon.
The explosion, called AT2021lwx, is not the brightest flash ever observed in the universe. That record is still held by a gamma-ray burst in October that was nicknamed BOAT — for Brightest Of All Time.
Philip Wiseman, an astrophysicist at Britain’s University of Southampton and the lead author of a new study, said that AT2021lwx was considered the “largest” explosion because it had released far more energy over the last three years than was produced by BOAT’s brief flash.

A fireball 100 times the size of our Solar System began blazing three years ago

Wiseman said it was an “accidental discovery”.
The Zwicky Transient Facility in California first spotted AT2021lwx during an automated sweep of the sky in 2020. But “it basically sat in a database” until being noticed by humans the following year, Wiseman said.
It was only when astronomers, including Wiseman, looked at it through more powerful telescopes that they realised what they had on their hands.
By analysing different wavelengths of light, they worked out that the explosion was roughly eight billion light years away.
That is much farther away than most other new flashes of light in the sky — which means the explosion behind it must be far greater.
It is estimated to be around two trillion times brighter than the Sun, Wiseman said.
Astronomers have looked into several possible explanations.
One is that AT2021lwx is an exploding star — but the flash is 10 times brighter than any previously seen “supernova”.
Another possibility is what is called a tidal disruption event, when a star is torn apart as it is sucked into a supermassive black hole. But AT2021lwx is still three times brighter than those events, and Wiseman said their research did not point in this direction.
The only somewhat comparable bright cosmic event is a quasar, when supermassive black holes swallow huge amounts of gas in the centre of galaxies.
But they tend to flicker in brightness, Wiseman said, whereas AT2021lwx suddenly started flaring up from nothing three years ago, and it is still blazing away.
‘Absolute puzzle’
In the new study, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the international team of researchers laid out what they believe is the most likely scenario.
Their theory is that a massive, single cloud of gas — around 5,000 times larger than the Sun — is slowly being consumed by a supermassive black hole.
But Wiseman said that “in science, there’s never certainty”. The team are working on new simulations to see if their theory is “fully plausible,” he added.
One problem could be that supermassive black holes sit in the centre of galaxies — for an explosion this size, the galaxy would be expected to be as vast as the Milky Way, Wiseman said.
But no one has been able to spot a galaxy in the vicinity of AT2021lwx.
“That’s an absolute puzzle,” Wiseman admitted.

The rival reports from the battlefront indicated an increase in fighting after months of relative stability, as expectations grow over Kyiv’s spring offensive.
Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, who is spearheading Moscow’s attack on Bakhmut, accused the Russian army of ‘fleeing’ from around the eastern Ukraine city.
The question of when and where Ukraine might launch its high-stakes fightback has been the subject of steady speculation, even after President Volodymr Zelensky insisted this week that his army needed more time to prepare.
The fresh fighting came as China said it would send a special envoy next week to Europe as Beijing pursues efforts to cast itself as peacemaker.
Beijing plans to send its high-ranking diplomat Li Hui to Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia to “communicate with all parties on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis”.

In a video seen by nearly three million people and entitled “I crashed my airplane,” Trevor Jacob appears to experience engine trouble while flying over southern California in November 2021.
The dramatic footage shows Jacob, 29, ejecting from the single engine plane — selfie-stick in hand — and parachuting into the dense vegetation of the Los Padres National Forest.
Cameras placed all over the aircraft show its out-of-control descent into the forest, and its eventual crash landing. Jacob films himself hiking to the wreckage where he appears dismayed to discover the water he packed has disappeared.
Viewers see him bush-whacking through poison oak and over hills as he seemingly struggles to find civilisation, giving regular updates about how thirsty he is, and how lost he feels. Finally, he stops to scoop water from a stream, and moments later comes across a vehicle and apparent salvation as night falls.

4,"Italy faces ‘demographic winter’, Pope warns","ROME: Pope Francis called on Friday for politicians to find solutions to reverse Italy’s declining birthrate,...","ROME: Pope Francis called on Friday for politicians to find solutions to reverse Italy’s declining birthrate, warning that young people faced a “Titanic effort” to start families in a precarious environment.
The 86-year-old pontiff opened the second day of a Rome conference involving politicians, business and social leaders focused on the dwindling number of babies born in Italy — a figure that experts warn will lead to the impoverishment of the nation.
For the first time last year, Italy’s births fell below the threshold of 400,000, at 393,000, according to Istat, the national statistics institute.
That compared to 713,499 deaths, in a population of around 58 million.
Francis, who received a standing ovation as he appeared onstage to address the conference alongside Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, said that young people today “live in a social climate in which starting a family is turning into a Titanic effort”.
He cited the difficulty of trying to plan for the future amid low salaries and high rents in Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, whose population is ageing and where many young people struggle to find stable full-time jobs.
“We need to prepare fertile ground for a new spring to blossom and leave this demographic winter behind us,” Francis said, calling for “forward-looking policies” to avoid Italy “(degenerating) into sadness”.
“Pets were replacing children in many households”, BBC quoted him as he saying while addressing a conference.
“Reviving the birthrate means repairing the forms of social exclusion that are affecting young people and their future,” he added.
‘World without babies’
“Have you ever imagined a world without babies?” was the provocative question used in publicity for the conference, organised by the Birthrate Foundation, a group with links to Catholic associations that advocate for families.
Despite the religious ties, conference speakers mostly steered clear of some of the more controversial issues related to Italy’s declining population, such as abortion, surrogacy and mass migration.
Speakers concentrated primarily on solutions including welfare, more childcare and tax relief.
Still, Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida, a key figure in Meloni’s far-right Brothers of Italy party, noted on Thursday during the conference that the birthrate issue was of concern “because we want to safeguard the culture, languages of Italy”.
He denied it had anything “to do with race”, after coming under fire by the opposition last month for warning against Italy’s “ethnic replacement” by migrants.
Meloni, who won the largest share of the women’s vote in September elections but does not consider herself a feminist, has made mothers and families a central part of her discourse.
In her address on Friday, she criticised what she called “the dominant culture” for making the topic of families almost taboo.
“We live in an era in which speaking about the birthrate, of maternity, of family has become even more difficult, sometimes it seems almost a revolutionary act,” said Meloni.

5,Gamers rush to get Nintendo’s new ‘Zelda’ after six-year wait,PARIS: Video game fans around the world flocked to shops on Friday to get their hands on the new edition of...,"PARIS: Video game fans around the world flocked to shops on Friday to get their hands on the new edition of “Zelda”, one of the most successful franchises in history and now central to the success of Japanese giant Nintendo.
Gamers queued hours before shops opened in cities from Paris to New York and Tokyo, desperate to be among the first to play “Tears of the Kingdom”, featuring the exploits of Princess Zelda and elf-like warrior Link.
Standing in line outside a Paris store before midnight, 19-year-old Taylor Meguira said the previous entry in the franchise’s storied cannon, 2017’s “Breath of the Wild”, had been a “real revolution”.
“Knowing that there is a sequel coming out in an hour or a little less, it’s just incredible, it just makes me so happy,” he said. In Tokyo, Yutaka Hirai, 30, queued with dozens of others, said the seemingly endless scale of previous Zelda games helped draw him in.
“I want to find the same wide open spaces and adventure in this game as in the previous ones,” he said, confessing he had played the previous title for “over 100 hours”.
Early reviews have gushed about the game, giving it a score of 97 out of 100 on metacritic, a site that compiles ratings from reviewers.
The Zelda franchise has sold 125 million copies worldwide since its first edition in 1986.
It helped forge “open world” games where the player is free to roam in virtual landscapes — an idea later taken up by titles ranging from “Grand Theft Auto” to “Skyrim”.

6,Depp makes comeback in scandal-hit  period drama,"PARIS: Johnny Depp’s comeback film is full of scandal both on-screen and off, as he tests out his French in the...","PARIS: Johnny Depp’s comeback film is full of scandal both on-screen and off, as he tests out his French in the role of King Louis XV.
There were rumours Depp only had a few minutes of screentime in Jeanne du Barry, which opens the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday and has a nationwide release in France the same day.
But the 59-year-old actor is present for much of the film, even if his dialogue is kept to short phrases that help disguise his American accent. Depp plays the 18th century monarch, who fell in love with a prostitute to the horror of much of his family and court.
He signed up for the role before the court cases against ex-wife Amber Heard involving bitter accusations of domestic violence that threatened to derail his career.
Maiwenn, the French star who directs and plays the lead role in Jeanne du Barry, admitted she was worried about the impact of the trials.
“The film was shot last summer and he was coming out of his second trial,” Maiwenn, who goes by a single name, said.
But Maiwenn said she had no doubts about casting Depp. “It was so clear (he was right for the role),” she said, though she approached two French actors first.
Depp gives an impressive physical performance — mostly through amused and imperious facial expressions — and his short bursts of dialogue suggest a decent level of French for the actor, who was previously married to French star Vanessa Paradis.
Many still see Depp as a toxic figure, despite his victory in the last defamation trial against Heard, but he has already lined up his next film, directing Al Pacino in a biopic of artist Amedeo Modigliani.
Depp’s trials are not the only scandal surrounding Jeanne du Barry, however.
In March, a well-known French journalist, Edwy Plenel of Mediapart, lodged a criminal complaint for assault against Maiwenn, accusing her of approaching him in a restaurant, grabbing him by the hair and spitting in his face. Plenel says it may have been motivated by articles about the rape allegations surrounding Maiwenn’s ex-husband and father of one of her children, director Luc Besson The Fifth Element.

7,SA govt under fire over US charge of arms sale to Russia,JOHANNESBURG: South Africans were left angry and baffled on Friday after the US accused their country of secretly...,"JOHANNESBURG: South Africans were left angry and baffled on Friday after the US accused their country of secretly shipping arms to Russia, a charge that triggered both a government rebuke and the announcement of an inquiry.
US ambassador Reuben Brigety said on Thursday Washington was confident weapons and ammunition had been laden onto a Russian freighter that docked at a Cape Town naval base.
The explosive remarks drew an angry response from President Cyril Ramaphosa, who however did not deny the charge, but said a retired judge would lead an investigation into the matter.
The move was welcomed by the United States, but met with a mix of ridicule and bewilderment at home, with many questioning how the government could not have known what had happened.
“It perhaps points to a South African president who simply is unaware of what is happening effectively under his nose,” political and economic analyst Daniel Silke said.
The emerging picture was of “information disarray” within the government, he said.
The Lady R, a cargo vessel under western sanctions flying a Russian flag, docked at South Africa’s largest naval base in December, officially to offload an old order of ammunition.
But ambassador Brigety said intelligence showed weaponry was loaded onto the vessel before it headed back to Russia.
“Did we or didn’t we? And if we did, shouldn’t the president know?” Bongani Bingwa, host of a popular morning radio show, wrote on Twitter.
Others quipped that the government appeared to be setting up inquiries for everything.
The deadline for the latest investigation has not been revealed, and there has been no immediate announcement as to who will lead it.
Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, a minister in the president’s office, told local media on Friday that South Africa  “cannot be bullied by the US” and would follow a “time frame that is suitable for us”.
‘Disingenuous’ 
If confirmed, the shipment would mark a break from South Africa’s professed neutrality over the conflict in Ukraine. The foreign ministry on Friday said there was no record of any approved arms sales to Russia during the period in question, but the probe would shed light on the case.
“There should be nothing to investigate,” Kobus Marais, a lawmaker with the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), said.
“The president as the commander-in-chief and the minister of defence should know exactly what happened,” he said.
“It’s disingenuous of them to suggest they’re innocent and just bystanders.” 
South Africa has been walking a diplomatic tightrope over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which it has refused to condemn, saying it prefers dialogue to end the war.

8,Eurovision strikes wrong note with UK over Zelensky ban,LIVERPOOL: The British government hit out at European broadcasters on Friday for banning a message by Ukrainian...,"LIVERPOOL: The British government hit out at European broadcasters on Friday for banning a message by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at this weekend’s Eurovision final, for fear of politicising the event.
The English city of Liverpool is hosting Saturday’s musical extravaganza on behalf of last year’s winner, Ukraine, due to the Russian invasion and has decked out its streets in yellow and blue.
But the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said “strict rules” prevented it from granting the Ukrainian leader’s request to speak by video, arguing the contest is  “non-political”.
“The prime minister believes it would be fitting for President Zelensky to address the event, and we’re disappointed by the decision from the European Broadcasting Union,” Rishi Sunak’s spokesman said.
“The values and freedoms that President Zelensky and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they’re fundamental.
“Eurovision themselves recognised that last year when they rightly suspended Russia’s participation from the competition,” he added, while declining to say if the UK would intervene with the BBC, the host broadcaster.
Organisers of the songfest may want to avoid politics, but some of the performers have clearly taken inspiration from current events.
Ukraine’s entry by electronic music group Tvorchi,  Heart of Steel, was inspired by the nearly month-long resistance put up by Ukrainian fighters at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steelworks.
Home of The Beatles 
Croatia’s song Mama SC! by the mustachioed Let 3 is a thinly veiled attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Switzerland’s singer Remo Forrer has opted for a more traditional message of peace with his entry Watergun.
There are also the annual accusations of vote-trading among friendly countries, but BBC co-presenter Rylan Clark defended the event.
“I just think Eurovision, people say it is political -- votes here, votes there. From being on the inside it is the least political experience you could ever have, actually,” he said.
Britain’s former prime minister Boris Johnson -- an early supporter of Ukraine during his premiership -- also waded in, saying “it would have been right to hear from President Zelensky”.
Zelensky told the BBC this week that notwithstanding his  “great respect” for the UK, he would have preferred Eurovision to take place in a neighbouring country, so Ukrainians could attend.

9,G7 officials debate reducing reliance on China,NIIGATA (Japan): Finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies discussed the need to make global...,"NIIGATA (Japan): Finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies discussed the need to make global supply chains more resilient by reducing over-reliance on China, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Friday.
Japan, which is hosting a three-day G7 meeting to debate key global themes in the city of Niigata, has been leading fresh efforts to diversify supply chains away from China by building partnerships with low- and middle-income countries through investment and aid.
Countries such as Germany wanted to reduce its dependency on China, Lindner told a press conference. “Here, emerging and low income countries come into play,” he added.
But while the G7 rich democracies are likely to agree on the partnership deal to beef up supply chains, they are not on the same page in terms of how far they should go in countering China — the world’s second largest economy that is not a G7 member.
The United States is at the forefront in pushing for stronger steps. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for targeted controls in investment to China to counter what she saw as Beijing’s “economic coercion” against other countries.
While wary of China as a strategic rival, Germany is cautious, however, of being seen as forging a G7 front against Beijing given its heavy reliance on trade with the country.
Japan is also sceptical about the idea of investment controls due to the huge impact such a move could have on global trade and its own economy, government officials say.
A Japanese finance ministry official who participated in the G7 talks told reporters on Friday the idea was discussed at the meeting, but that Japan’s initiatives were not targeted at any particular country.
British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt told the Nikkei newspaper on Thursday the G7 must counter China’s economic coercion, though made no mention of investment controls.
Global risks loom
Hanging over the meeting was a lack of progress in resolving a US debt ceiling stalemate.
The G7 nations can little afford further risks to their fragile economies and there were some voices of concern raised over the potential dire consequences if the US were to fail to resolve the impasse, which could tip its economy into recession.
A scheduled meeting on Friday between US President Joe Biden and top lawmakers was postponed until early next week as the two sides seek a compromise to avoid a catastrophic default.
Germany’s Lindner said he hoped US politicians would come to a “grown-up” decision on talks to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling — the maximum amount the US government is authorised to borrow.
World Bank President David Malpass told Reuters the risk of a US default added to problems already facing the global economy that was entering a prolonged period of slow growth.
“It looks like global growth will fall below 2 per cent this year in 2023, but then, as you look at future years, it may stay low for several years,” due to rising borrowing costs and high levels of debt, Malpass said on Friday in Niigata.
Stubbornly high inflation has forced US and European central banks to hike interest rates aggressively, weighing on their economies and stoking fears of financial instability after the failure of three US banks.
The health of the global financial system and measures to avert another digital bank run were discussed at the G7 meeting, the Japanese finance ministry official said.

10,Ex-NBC ad chief Yaccarino named Twitter CEO,"LOS ANGELES: Former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino will become Twitter’s new CEO, current chief...","LOS ANGELES: Former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino will become Twitter’s new CEO, current chief executive Elon Musk said in a tweet on Friday.
“I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!” Musk said. “@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.” 
Yaccarino modernised the Comcast Corp entertainment and media division’s advertising business and had been in talks for the job before NBC announced her departure on Friday morning.
Since Musk acquired Twitter in October, advertisers have fled the platform, worried that their ads could appear next to inappropriate content after the company lost nearly 80 per cent of staff. Musk earlier this year acknowledged that Twitter suffered a massive decline in ad revenue.
Twitter’s “trajectory will immediately take a 180-degree turn” under her leadership, said Lou Paskalis, a long-time ad industry executive and CEO of AJL Advisory, a marketing consultancy.
Musk axed thousands of employees, rushed the launch of a subscription product that allowed scammers to impersonate major brands and suspended users with whom he disagreed.
“I think (Yaccarino) has climbed every mountain she could at NBCU and did it impeccably well. And there’s no greater challenge than restoring order at Twitter,” he said.
Yaccarino’s exit is another big blow to NBCUniversal. Last month, NBC parent Comcast said NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell was leaving after acknowledging an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, following a complaint that prompted an investigation.
Advertising President Mark Marshall will step in as interim chairman of NBCUniversal’s advertising and partnerships group. Marshall was named president of ad sales and partnerships in 2018.
Yaccarino’s exit comes at a difficult time for NBCUniversal, which is preparing for its annual upfront presentation to advertisers on Monday at Radio City Music Hall.
Yaccarino joined NBCU in 2011, after 15 years at Turner Entertain­ment, and has been credited with taking the network’s ad sales operation into the digital era.
As broadcast television audiences migrated to streaming, she took to the stage at Radio City Music Hall last year to tell advertisers their brand messages were not an afterthought. She said NBCUniversal incorporated ads in its Peacock streaming service from the outset.
“Twitter needs credibility with the advertising community,” said Greg Kahn, chief executive of GK Digital Ventures media consultancy.

11,US lifts Covid-era asylum curbs on border,"Across the border in Ciudad Juarez a day earlier, migrant shelters were half full, holding about 1,600 people.","CIUDAD JUAREZ (Mexico): The United States on Friday ended a Covid-19 border restriction that had blocked many migrants at the border with Mexico, immediately replacing the order known as Title 42 with a sweeping new asylum regulation meant to deter illegal crossings.
Several last-minute court actions added confusion to how President Joe Biden’s reworked border policies will play out, with advocates filing a legal challenge to the new asylum restrictions as they took effect.
In El Paso, Texas, hundreds of migrants slept outside on American soil in front of the border fence as the sun rose on Friday morning. Texas National Guard, state troopers and border agents patrolled the surrounding area where migrants have waited after surrendering to US border authorities.
Across the border in Ciudad Juarez a day earlier, migrant shelters were half full, holding about 1,600 people. Two shelter directors said many of the migrants were planning to apply for legal US entry via an app called CBP One.
Just before Title 42 was set to expire at midnight on Thursday, immigration advocates represented by the American Civil Liberties Union sued over the new asylum bars, claiming they violate US laws and international agreements.
Advocates argue the new regulation, put in place by Biden’s Democratic administration to curb illegal crossings, resembles restrictions imposed by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
The rights groups successfully blocked the Trump rules in court and asked the same California-based federal judge to block these as well.
US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the Biden regulation in a series of television interviews on Friday morning, saying it aims to encourage migrants to enter using legal pathways rather than crossing illegally “It’s going to be a tough transition,” he told MSNBC.
