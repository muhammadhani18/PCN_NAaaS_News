0,Seven teachers among eight killed in Kurram attacks over ‘land dispute’,"Senior official denies sectarian motive for killings, cites land dispute between villages involving the two sides.","KURRAM: Gunmen killed eight people, including seven teachers, in separate attacks here on Thursday, officials said.
Police sources claimed a land dispute led to the killings.
They said the first gun attack was reported in Upper Kurram’s Shalozan Road area with resident Mohammad Sharif losing life.
The police sources said gunmen opened fire in an examination hall of the Government High School of Teri Mangal area killing Syed Hussain, Liaquat Hussain, Syed Ali Shah, Mehdi Hussain, Mohammad Ali, Ali Hussain and another invigilator.
In a video message, deputy commissioner of Kurram Syed Saiful Islam said the people were killed over a land dispute.

Caretaker chief minister seeks report

He, however, said the district administration, police and local elders were striving to restore the order. The DC promised a proper investigation into the killings.
Following the killings, a state of emergency was declared in the public sector hospitals of Kurram district. Medical superintendent of the district headquarters hospital Qaiser Abbas told Dawn that the body of the victim of the first gun attack was handed over to his family.
He said he had declared emergency in the hospital after learning about an increase in the number of the deceased and the injured.
Meanwhile, authorities closed roads across the district as a security measure following the killings, while the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Kohat, postponed the ongoing examination for matriculation.
Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Sajid Hussain Turi condemned the killing of teachers and said the attack was meant to destroy peace in the district.
The local officials told Dawn that the people were killed over a shamlat land not demarcated between Gedu and Pewar villages.
They said the land dispute dated back to 1950s and had claimed 16 lives on both sides in 2021 when Gedu villagers objected to the felling of trees by Pewar villagers to use the wood for fuel near their area.
The officials, however, said a jirga decided at the request of Pewar villagers that they would be allowed to chop trees down outside Gedu Mozzah and away from the site of the Nov 2022 killing. It also decided that the land would be demarcated in line with revenue records to resolve the dispute.
However, Gedu villagers backed out leaving the issue unresolved. The sources said gunmen attacked three Gedu people leaving one dead. The Gedu villagers blamed Pewar for the killing.
On Thursday, a Gedu villager was killed near the Upper Kurram area. A crowd retaliated and killed teachers in an exam hall.
Officials said recently, a delegation met the provincial governor and Kohat commissioner for the resolution of land disputes in Kurram tribal district. However, miscreants scuttled the process, they insisted.
A senior official claimed that the killings came over a land dispute between two villages and that it was not a sectarian issue as the two sides had people from both sects.
Meanwhile, caretaker Chief Minister Mohammad Azam Khan condemned the killings over land dispute and directed authorities to submit a report about them to him.

5,"High court puts govt, PDA on notice over delay in handover of plots",Holds preliminary hearing in Regi Town plot possession case,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Peshawar Development Authority and Peshawar commissioner seeking their response to a petition against a long delay in the grant of possession of plots in the Regi Model Town here.
A bench consisting of Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Syed Arshad Ali issued the order after holding preliminary hearing into the petition of 550 plot allottees, who requested it to declare the ‘denial’ of the possession of plots in the RMT zones I, II and V illegal and with ulterior motives.
Petitioners Mohammad Qaim Khan, Mohammad Iqbal and others, who claim to be representing 17,000 families, prayed the court to declare that the lingering land dispute between the Kukikhel Afridi tribe and the government is illegal and non-compliance with the terms agreed upon by elders of the tribe and the government on Feb 16, 1991.
They also sought orders for the respondents, including the provincial government and the PDA, to give them plot possession due to payments.

Holds preliminary hearing in Regi Town plot possession case

The petitioners requested the court to direct the government to stop members of Kukikhel tribe from building houses in the RMT and to settle the Maffey Griffith Line Peshawar to allow them to construct houses on their plots.
The bench directed the local government secretary, PDA director-general and Peshawar commissioner to file their respective comments to the petition.
Next date of hearing will be fixed later.
Advocate Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel appeared for the petitioners and said his clients were allottees of plots in the RMT, which was a project of the PDA, but possession of those plots had not been given to them despite allotment in 1993.
He said plots in the scheme’s zones III and IV were developed and houses were constructed on them.
The lawyer said the dates of allotment of plots in all zones was the same but due to dispute of the Maffey Grift Line between the Kukikhel tribe and the government over the ownership of land, the allottees of plots in three zones still awaited due rights.
He contended that some of them had purchased it from their original owners and that they had long been aggrieved by the denial of plot possession as the respondents didn’t take the dispute seriously and were not resolving it.
The lawyer said the aggrieved families totaled more than 17,000, while the land, which was disputed in zones I and II, measured 532 acres.
He said on Feb 16, 1991, a meeting was held by authorities with elders of the Kukikhel tribe which was also brought into writing and the terms on which the tribe agreed was duly signed by the authorised Malik Attaullah Jan Kukikhel.
The counsel, however, said the Kukikhel tribe created an issue from the Maffey Griffith Line.
He said the Kukikhels were continuously violating the Maffey Griffith Line and the terms agreed initially by them in the said meeting and were also constructing houses on that land in RMT and thus, causing irreparable loss to them.

8,JUI-F ruling Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: PTI,"PTI's Taj Mohammad says “powers of the executive are exercised by JUI-F leaders Akram Khan Durrani and [governor] Haji Ghulam Ali"".","BATTAGRAM: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader and former special assistant to the chief minister Taj Mohammad Khan on Thursday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was ruled by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and not by a neutral caretaker government.
“Instead of caretaker Chief Minister Azam Khan, the powers of the executive in the province are exercised by JUI-F leaders Akram Khan Durrani and [governor] Haji Ghulam Ali,” Mr Khan told Dawn here.
The PTI leader, who is a former MPA, said his party’s government strived for the people’s development and delivered the goods but the then opposition conspired against it.
He said the Pakistan Democratic Movement government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ruined the country’s economy beyond repair.
“The [opposition] PDM used to criticise the [ruling] PTI over inflation and lawlessness but look at what it has done to the economy after grabbing power,” he said.
Mr Khan claimed that as the lawmaker, he ensured the spending of around Rs1 billion funds in his constituency to build roads, develop other infrastructure, and supply clean drinking water.
He also said the last budget had Rs500 million to purchase land in his area for setting up a university, while the health insurance programme was extended to all families in the province.

9,Landi Kotal hospital admin accused of issuing Indian drugs to patients,KHYBER: Patients in Landi Kotal have accused the administration of district headquarters hospital of issuing them...,"KHYBER: Patients in Landi Kotal have accused the administration of district headquarters hospital of issuing them banned Indian medicines from the pharmacy.
The patients and their attendants started criticising the administration of the hospital after a video clip shared by a patient, Shawoor Afridi, of Indian medicines provided to him from the hospital store went viral on social media.
In the video, Mr Afridi displayed at least four types of medicines and alleged that the drugs were manufactured in India that were banned in all public sector hospitals while the DHQ hospital store keeper was openly distributing those among the local patients.
He said that the medicines were manufactured in 2022 with expiry duration of only one year while the hospital authorities insisted that it was provided to them in 2021.
The medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Jamshed Sherani, acknowledged that Indian medicines were kept at the pharmacy and then provided to needy patients on the prescription of local doctors.
He said that the current stock of Indian medicines was handed over to him by his predecessor Dr Nekdad Afridi, who was transferred in 2021. He was, however, at loss to explain the inscription of manufacturing date which was 2022.
The hospital superintendent, Khitab Jan, when contacted, offered a different explanation and insisted that the medicines were provided to them by the directorate of health services.
Another official in the hospital, who requested anonymity, came up with another justification of the presence of Indian medicines and said that that the drugs were ‘donated’ to the hospital on a request after the 2022 floods. He, however, could not explain as to why DHQ hospital Landi Kotal was chosen for such donation when the region was not affected by the 2022 floods.
Patients, their attendants and locals demanded an impartial enquiry into the issue. They said that sale and purchase of smuggled Indian medicines was strictly banned in local market whereas it was being openly prescribed to patients at Landi Kotal hospital.
Meanwhile, some local residents have also accused Dr Jamshed Sherani of providing substandard medicines to patients, who were treated under the Sehat Card Plus programme.
He remained in the middle of controversies as the health directorate and anti-corruption department had initiated two separate inquiries against him for alleged misappropriation of hospital funds, mistreating doctors and paramedics and unlawfully withholding salaries of the nursing staff.
Sources said that the directorate of health services was dragging its feet to make the findings of its inquiry public while the probe by anti-corruption department was in process, though at a snail’s pace.

10,ECP gets two more days to respond to PTI’s plea against KP poll delay,PHC fixes next hearing for May 10 declaring it would decide the issue on that date.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday adjourned hearing into a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf petition seeking orders for the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold election to the provincial assembly within 90 days of its dissolution in January this year or with the minimum possible deviation from that deadline.
The adjournment came from a bench consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah until May 10 due to the absence of the counsel for the provincial governor.
The bench fixed the next hearing for May 10 declaring that there won’t be any further adjournments and that it would decide the issue on that date.
It also directed the ECP’s counsel to submit comments on the petition within two days.
The bench put off the hearing after Tariq Afridi, lawyer for the provincial governor, filed an application for adjournment saying he is busy with preparations for the May 6 PHC Bar Association elections as a candidate.

PHC adjourns hearing due to absence of counsel for governor

During the last hearing on April 19, the high court had ordered the governor and ECP to file their respective comments on the petition jointly filed by KP Assembly Speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani and PTI secretary general Asad Umar.
The petitioners requested the court to declare illegal and unconstitutional a letter written by the governor to the ECP in March to recommend Oct 8 as the election date and a subsequent notification by the commission to fix that date for polls.
The KP Assembly was dissolved by the governor on Jan 18 on the advice of the then chief minister.
Barrister Gohar Khan appeared for the petitioners and said the 90-day election deadline stipulated by the Constitution had expired on April 18.
Despite persistent campaigning by the PTI for holding polls within that deadline since the dissolution of the assembly, the issue lingered on.
The ECP issued the impugned notification on March 27 fixing Oct 8 as the polling day.
The petitioners requested the court to declare that election to the provincial assembly is to be held not later than 90 days of its dissolution, subject to the “barest minimum deviation in present circumstances.”
They asked the court to direct KP Governor Haji Ghulam Ali or President Dr Arif Alvi to announce the election date while conforming to the legal framework.
Lawyers General Aamir Javed and Advocate Mohsin Kamran Siddique represented the provincial government and ECP, respectively.
When the bench began hearing into the petition, the counsel for petitioners said that this was an important constitutional matter but continued to linger on.
He said that the governor’s lawyer had submitted an application seeking adjournment of the hearing insisting that he was preparing for contesting the imminent PHCBA elections.
Advocate general Aamir Javed said that he had submitted a reply to the PTI’s petition on behalf of the provincial government.
The ECP’s lawyer said the response to the petition was ready and would be submitted to the court.
However, the bench reminded him that on the previous hearing, he was given the last chance to produce the same. It gave him two more days to respond to the petition in writing.
It observed that it would definitely hear all parties to the matter on next hearing.
Barrister Gohar Khan contended that the election date announced by the governor was contrary to his clear mandate given by the Constitution and tantamount to depriving the petitioners and other residents of the province of their fundamental right guaranteed under Article 17 of the Constitution to contest and participate in election.
He argued that under Article 242(2) of Constitution when the national or a provincial assembly was dissolved, a general election must be held within 90 days and the results of the polls had to be declared no later than 14 days after their consolidation.
The lawyer said the intention of the Constitution was that elections had to be held within the stipulated period and that it couldn’t be delayed on the pretext that finances or security personnel for them were not provided by the federal government.

During a council session chaired by convener Liaquat Khassan here, chairman of the local body Ibrahim Shah criticised the district education officer (female) for ordering those transfers and said the tehsil council couldn’t allow such moves.
He said the DEO misused authority by transferring teachers from primary and high schools in Ghanool, Goscha, Khaith Sarash and other areas that faced a severe shortage of teaching and nonteaching staff members.
Mr Shah demanded the immediate cancellation of those transfers to ensure the schoolgirls’ smooth access to formal learning.
Earlier, the councillors nominated Mr Khassan as the presiding officer and convener of the council.
Councillors Raja Khalid Nawaz and Sajid Khan raised objections about the procedure of the selection of the presiding officer and said they didn’t accept Mr Khassan as the presiding officer until his election was held strictly under the Local Government Act.
Another council member Mohammad Maroof Awan said he believed in positive criticism of the policies and moves of the treasury for the “sake of people’s welfare.”

They said that they were fed up with the frequent imposition of fines by traffic police and would no more tolerate undue and unjust traffic violation tickets.
The protest was organised by All Swat Transporters Association and Ittefaq Rickshaw Drivers Union outside Swat Press Club. A large number of rickshaw drivers participated in the demonstration. Ziaur Rahman Yousafzai, Noor Alam, Sabz Ali and Samillullah addressed the protest.
They alleged that traffic police were issuing tickets illegally to poor rickshaw drivers. “Police have started a planned campaign to bother and tease rickshaw drivers. Our children face hunger because we pay heavy fines and save nothing,” they said.
The speakers said that impounding rickshaws for two or three days was not only injustice but also cruelty with them and their families. “It is the right of every citizen to earn livelihood in a legal way but rickshaw drivers are being treated unjustly,” they added.
They said they did not favour or support illegal rickshaws in Swat. They said action should be taken against illegal rickshaws. They urged authorities to take notice of the issue and save their children from starvation.
They threatened to take their children to the streets along with rickshaws if police did not mend their ways.
