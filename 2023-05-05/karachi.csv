1,Murad promises end to Karachi’s transport problems within next fiscal,"Stresses necessary allocations for BRT projects, ongoing and new development schemes.","KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Thursday directed the authorities concerned to complete the various ongoing transport schemes and launch new ones, including the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects, in the next fiscal. He said his government wanted to resolve the transport problems in the metropolis. 
Presiding over a meeting to shape up Annual Development Programme (ADP) for the next financial year (2023-24), he also directed the planning and development department to propose allocations as local share for foreign-funded transport schemes. 
“We have to resolve the transport issue of Karachi by completing different BRT projects in the next financial year,” the chief minister said while directing his team to make necessary allocations accordingly. 
He said the ongoing and new transport schemes for Karachi had to be completed and launched within the next financial year to resolve the city’s transport issue. 

Stresses necessary allocations for BRT projects, ongoing and new development schemes 

The BRT Red Line project was launched in Feb 2022 with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Its track is stretched over 26 kilometres between Model Colony in Malir and Merewether Tower covering University Road, M.A. Jinnah Road and its extension road and Numaish Chowrangi. 
The construction work on the project had reportedly been halted due to some administrative problems and a shortage of construction material. However, the transport department denied the reports saying that the project was being executed under the strict monitoring of the ADB. 
The construction work on the Yellow Line is also expected to start in the next fiscal. 
The dedicated corridor of the Yellow Line bus service will start from Dawood Chowrangi in Korangi Industrial Area via Jam Sadiq Bridge, Main Korangi Road, FTC Interchange, Sharea Faisal, Shahrah-i-Quaideen and Kashmir Road. It will integrate with Red Line at Numaish. 
Karachi water project 
The chief minister directed the P&D department to expedite work for the completion of the required formalities of Rs600 billion Karachi Water & Sewerage Service Improvement Project (KWSSIP) so that water board’s services could be improved. 
The KWSSIP — which is developed after detailed discussions among stakeholders in Karachi with the World Bank, technical experts and consultants — aims at bringing the targeted institutional and governance reforms in Karachi Water and Sewerage Board along with a massive strategic investment programme for improvement of water and sewerage infrastructure in Karachi. 
Flood victims’ rehabilitation
The chief minister asked the planning & development department to prioritise the rehabilitation of flood-affected people, repair and maintenance of the infrastructure devastated by the recent floods, and prepare a plan for the development of agricultural and industrial sectors. 
Giving guidelines to the P&D for finalising the ADP for the next financial year, the chief minister said priority would be given to the schemes of infrastructure affected by the floods. 
“I want to get repaired or reconstructed the school buildings, hospitals, roads and irrigation network so that they could be made functional again,” he said. 
The meeting participants were told that during the current financial year (2022-23) 4,158 schemes were launched.
The chief minister directed the planning and development department to complete at least 800 schemes by the end of the current financial year. 
Chairman of P&D Hassan Naqvi, briefing the meeting, said that six new foreign-funded schemes of the World Bank and one of the Asian Development Bank had been approved. They include WB-Sindh Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project of Rs48 billion, Sindh Flood Emergency Housing Reconstruction Project of Rs110 billion, Sindh Water & Agriculture Transformation Project of Rs64 billion, Sindh Integrated Health & Population Project of Rs55 billion and Strengthening the Social Protection Delivery System for Rs42 billion and Sindh Flood Emergency Assistance Project by Asian Development Bank of Rs43.9 billion. 
He also briefed the meeting about foreign-funded projects in the pipeline such as World Bank’s Sindh Transformational Accelerated Rural Services (STARS), Sindh Livestock and Aquaculture Development (SLAD) project and Asian Development Bank’s projects, including the Sindh Secondary Cities Improvement Project, Phase-II, Katchi Abadis project, Sindh Coastal Resilience Project, Provincial Road Improvement Project, Sindh Health System Strengthening Project and Integrated Transport Improvement Project of Hyderabad. 
The CM also directed all the departments concerned to file their proposed schemes with the P&D department so that they could be included in the next ADP. 
The meeting was held at CM House and attended by chief secretary Sohail Rajput, chairman of P&D Hassan Naqvi, finance secretary Sajid Jamal Abro, secretary to CM Rahim Shaikh, member P&D Fatah Tunio and others concerned.

According to a Railways spokesperson, the fire broke out after sparks caused by an electrical fault while the train was moving between the Landhi and Bin Qasim stations.
“The train left the Cantt station at 7:10pm and the fire broke out in one of its coaches as it left the Landhi station,” the spokesperson informed Dawn.

• JI fears rigging, demands Rangers’ deployment at polling stations                          
KARACHI: More than half a million registered voters would exercise their right to franchise on Sunday (May 7) in the by-election for the remaining seats of local government institutions in five divisions of Sindh. 
A meeting to review the arrangements for the polling was held here on Thursday with Chief Secretary Dr Muhammad Suhail Rajput in the chair. It was attended by Provincial Election Commissioner Aijaz Anwar Chauhan, Additional IG Karachi Javed Alam Odho, the secretary school education and divisional commissioner, besi­des the deputy commissioners of the districts concerned. 
The meeting was informed 292 polling stations across the province had been declared ‘highly sensitive’ in terms of security. 
“At the meeting, the chief secretary said that the Sindh government was completing the arrangements regarding the by-elections in the province,” said a statement issued after the meeting. The CS directed all deputy commissioners to ensure availability all missing facilities at the polling stations. 
He informed the meeting that 690,295 people would exercise their right to franchise on May 7 in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Shaheed Benazirabad and Larkana divisions.  
The meeting was told that CCTV cameras would be installed at 292 ‘highly-sensitive’ out of the total 449 polling stations in the province.
JI demands deployment of Ran­gers 
Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) has demanded deployment of Rangers personnel in and outside polling stations, particularly in Karachi, to ensure peace and transparency in the process. 
In a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), JI’s Karachi chapter termed the May 7 elections “crucial”, and said there were strong apprehensions among the contesting parties that both district and security administrations could be used by the ruling party to influence the process. 
JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman has already expressed his fear that the May 7 elections “could be rigged by the ruling party to establish its fake majority”. He urged the ECP to play its due role in ensuring peaceful and transparent election process. 
“Progress and development in Karachi is associated with the victory of Jamaat-i-Islami in the by-election for the 11 remaining UCs,” he said while addressing a motorcycle rally held in New Karachi. By-election in this area is being held in three UCs. 
“Our party has already proved its strongest position against all rivals in the Jan 15 local government elections in the city despite undemocratic practices and fascist tactics employed by the Pakistan People Party government in Sindh,” he said, adding that the May 7 elections are, therefore, crucial for us to seal our majority by ensuring free and fair voting process.  
“For this, we demand deployment of Rangers personnel at polling stations so that any attempt to rig the election or create a law and order situation could be avoided,” he said.

4,KU non-teaching staff go on three-day pen down strike,"Protesters say their rallies, sit-ins for leave encashment have gone unnoticed so far."," 

Employees of the University of Karachi hold a general body meeting on the campus on Thursday.—Dawn

KARACHI: Frustrated over non-payment of leave encashment at Karachi University (KU) this year, its non-teaching staff held a general body meeting on Thursday where they announced a three-day pen down strike from tomorrow (Friday).
The meeting, held in KU’s Arts Auditorium, was followed by a series of demonstrations, sit-ins and rallies on the campus.
Interestingly, sources said, the well-attended meeting had no elected representation of the non-teaching staffers, which numbered more than 2,500 at the university
The KU administration this year, they said, hadn’t released leave encashment to any employees, including teachers, on the ground that the university was facing a financial crisis, particularly after the Higher Education Commission deducted a huge sum from the university’s allocated funds.

Protesters say their rallies, sit-ins for leave encashment have gone unnoticed so far

“The general body meeting was successful in terms of numerical representation of the non-teaching staffers despite their infightings and the consensus that emerged in the end,” a senior KU teacher told Dawn, adding that the non-teaching staff also had the moral support of Karachi University Teachers’ Society (Kuts).
“But, the society at this stage can’t afford to extend its official support to the non-teaching staff as it’s holding dialogues over the matter with the vice chancellor,” he said.
Sources said KU’s non-teaching staffers were divided in several groups, often without any elected representation. One group was reportedly holding meetings with the vice chancellor over the issue.
“We have been holding protests in favour of leave encashment in front of the administration block for weeks before taking the decision to have a complete strike today,” said Tariq Shah, one of the attendees of Thursday’s general body meeting.
The staff approached the vice chancellor’s office several times but his secretary didn’t set an appointment for a meeting, he complained.
Sharing details of the meeting, he said three options were presented before the participants and they chose to go on a three-day pen down strike.
“One option was to go on a mutual month-long leave and the other was to go on an indefinite strike, while continuing with the sit-in outside the administration block.
“If nothing comes out of our three-day strike, we will hold another general body meeting next week and take a decision,” Mr Tariq said, emphasising that the non-teaching staff were apolitical and their objective was to alleviate people’s financial sufferings.
The protesters, he said, would be holding a meeting with Kuts on Friday.
“Look at the pace of inflation. The prices of all basic commodities have risen to a point that poor families’ very survival is now at risk. Leave encashment is our legal right and the vice chancellor can’t deprive us of this,” another participant shared on condition of anonymity, adding that it’s the second time in five years that the staff had been refused leave encashment.
The university administration, he complained, had deprived the non-teaching staff to have medical treatment at reputed hospitals.
He rejected reports about closing down of the transport service for students or a boycott of the upcoming BA examination in protest.
“Our protest is peaceful. We won’t use force as means to build up pressure on the administration. If we couldn’t get a positive response, then we will decide our future strategy with consensus next week.”
The vice chancellor was not available for comment.

6,"Opposition alliance warns controversies  surrounding census may lead  to ethnic divide, bloodshed",Vows to resist any attempt to divide Sindh,"KARACHI: Describing the ‘flaws’ in the ongoing census surrounded by ‘controversies’ as an attempt to divide Sindh on ethnic and rural-urban grounds, the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) on Thursday warned that the flaws could lead to “bloodshed and instability” in the country if they were not fixed and removed before completion of the headcount exercise. 
The opposition party also accused the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of “playing a criminal role” in the ongoing exercise only for “greed of power”. 
Syed Sadaruddin Shah Rashidi, Dr Safdar Abbasi and other leaders of the GDA — an umbrella organisation of different political parties representing opposition — met at Functional League House here to discuss the political situation in the country, the census controversy and the current economic meltdown amid skyrocketing inflation and growing miseries of a common man. 
Addressing a press conference after the meeting, GDA leaders warned both the federal and the provincial governments that their alliance would resist any attempt to divide Sindh and demanded that the controversial census that was being carried out with biased approach and flawed design should be stopped immediately. 

Vows to resist any attempt to divide Sindh

“Let me make it very clear that we won’t let Sindh to divide,” said GDA chief coordinator Syed Sadaruddin Shah Rashidi who was accompanying senior leadership of the alliance. 
“If any such attempt is made, there will be bloodshed and it will affect every segment of the country. The people of Sindh are united in every corner of the province and their patriotism is the actual guarantor of Pakistan’s integrity and security.” 
Those who are hatching a conspiracy against Sindh’s unity through this census are actually conspiring against Pakistan.”
Mr Shah rejected the impression that his alliance was against any fair count of urban areas, saying that Karachi was the economic engine of the country and he would never accept any injustice with the metropolis. 
“Karachi is jewel of our crown. We only demand fair and honest count. We cannot tolerate any injustice with any district, village or town. 
We are for strong federation, strong institutions and strong Pakistan. We are here for peace, love and harmony not for hatred or ethnic divide,” added Mr Shah. 
PPP accused of having sold out Sindh
GDA general secretary Dr Safdar Abbasi strongly criticised the PPP which, he said, had “sold out” Sindh in its greed of power and was now playing a ‘criminal’ role in the flawed census that would deprive people of this second largest province of their rights and due share in resources. 
“From coastal belt of Karachi to deserts of Thar, the PPP has sold out everything but still it appears to be hungry and can do anything for its greed,” he said. 
“I wonder how the PPP is supporting this federal government on this flawed census. They [PPP leaders] once called this parliament selected, but now they are sitting in the same parliament and giving legitimacy to every move that is aimed at dividing Sindh. But this would never happen.” 
He also referred to a ‘dangerous game’ being played in Karachi amid the ongoing census based on ethnic hatred and misconceptions. 
The ruling PPP, he said, had deliberately opted for a silence amid the conspiracy because the “politics of divide has let it enjoy the power for consecutive 15 years”. 
Jamaat-i-Islami criticised
He questioned the role of the Jamaat-i-Islami and accused it of spreading hatred while opposing the census exercise. 
“Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman [the Karachi chief of JI] shouldn’t have taken this line and we find it very alarming and unfortunate,” said Dr Abbasi. 
“It would only trigger hatred and ethnic divide. We expect every patriotic individual and those political parties who believe in federation and national unity to stay united under the Constitution of Pakistan. That’s what we want. The ruling elite have ruined every single institution and now they want to divide people of Pakistan on ethnic grounds.”

Mr Sato urged that waste management plan should be implemented at the site for safe handling and disposal of waste material generated from construction activities to fulfill legal and contractual requirements.
Mr Haq instructed to collect waste material from source and said after segregation it should be stored at designated area for final disposal.
Adnan Khan, deputy conservator of the Wildlife Department said that the department had rescued 14 Indus Blind Dolphins from various canals and up and down streams of Guddu and Sukkur barrages.

The  lecture was delivered here the other day by Dr Sikandar Mughul, author  of 13 books, who traced history of universe and talked in detail about  theory of evolutionary stages of human society, including 200,000 years  old hunter and gatherer stage, 70,000 years old cognitive revolution  stage, which included the development of human dialects and gossips  giving rise to preliminary ideas, superstitions, myths, magic, religion  and other systems of human thought. 
The lecture was organised by Sindh University Larkana campus’ Science Literature and Arts Society.  
Dr  Mughal, former registrar of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical  University, discussed the 12,000 years old agricultural revolution stage  which transformed the society into classes with permanent settlements  in the form of villages, towns, cities with private land, property,  wealth and other resources along the riversides giving rise to ancient  civilisations, including Indus Valley Civilisation, Mesopotamian  Civilization, Egyptian Civilization, Chinese, Greek and Roman  Civilizations.  
Dr Mughal talked about scientific revolution and  the development of scientific thought during last 500 years and compared  and analyzed it with earlier stages of religious thought.  
Pro  Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Azhar Ali Shah, who presided over the event,  elaborated on the relation between science and religion and said that  religion had evolved over the centuries and science was considered to be  the soul of true and authenticated religion as it helped interpret  religious verities.

The party president Lal Jarwar, secretary general Noor Ahmed Katyar and others claimed in a statement issue here on Thursday that population in the blocks identified by MQM and JI was being inflated artificially. 
They said that the census, which had been rejected by all the provinces and people from Gilgit and Siriaki belt, was illegal and unconstitutional and called for repatriating all illegal Afghan and Burmese immigrants from Karachi in line with Supreme Court’s judgement in Karachi lawlessness case. 
They said that the census process had been started by federal government with the facilitation of Pakistan Peoples Party government to convert Sindhis into minority but in reality it would undermine the country’s integrity as well. 
They maintained that holding of census prematurely was in fact tantamount to pushing genuine demands of indigenous population against the wall. Extending census’ period only to increase artificially the size of population in Hyderabad and Karachi was a conspiracy against Sindh and Pakistan’s integrity, they said. 
They said that PPP government was only writing letters to federal government and was not using the option of quitting the coalition government over wrong enumeration being done at the behest of JI and MQM.
They said that PPP must take a firm stand over the issue to declare through its action whether it was with people of Sindh or with anti-Sindh parties of MQM and JI. The party’s conduct reflected it supported the two parties’ attempts to push Sindhis against the wall, they said.

12,Growers’ body dismayed at drop in tomato price,LARKANA: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture has expressed concern over dismally low price of tomato in the market and...,"LARKANA: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture has expressed concern over dismally low price of tomato in the market and called for establishment of pulp and ketchup factories in Larkana to save growers from huge losses in the event of oversupply of the vegetable and consequent drop in its price. 
SCA Larkana chapter president Syed Sirajul Auliya Rashdi said in a statement issued here on Thursday that the district had a bumper crop of tomato but unfortunately its rate had drastically dropped in the market where it was being sold for just at Rs10 per kilogram. 
He said that traders were reluctant to buy it at this low rate, which in turn was casting negative impact on growers. Tomato crop was cultivated in Larkana, Shikarpur and parts of Khairpur districts and the riverine belt of the districts and their adjoining areas on approximately 17,000 hectares. 
The growers normally spent Rs2,50,000 on cultivating one acre crop of tomato, he said and claimed that due to government’s indifferent attitude, farmers and small growers had to bear the huge losses running into millions of rupees. 
He said that Islamabad and Quetta were potential markets of Larkana’s tomato and over 100 trucks and mini trucks loaded with tomatoes were transported from Larkana and its surroundings to different parts of the country.
He pointed towards the trend of exporting tomatoes to Afghanistan and said that country could earn millions of dollars as foreign exchange. 
He believed that unavailability of tomato ketchup factories and driers and flawed planning of value addition chain had severely damaged tomato crop in Larkana and surrounding areas. 
Of 120 tomato loaded trucks that arrived in Islamabad market on Tuesday 100 were from Larkana alone which spoke volumes for the size of the vegetable’s produce in the district and in its adjoining areas, he said.
He said that it was a common sight in the areas that one could see people standing along roadsides with plastic bags filled with tomatoes offering for just Rs50 to 80 for over eight to 10 kilograms of a bag. 
He said that many growers had stopped picking the crop due to low rates. It would ultimately inflict financial losses on the growers. “What a tragedy the tomato which was once sold in the market at Rs400 per kilo is now available at only Rs10 a kilo,” he lamented.
Mr Rashdi urged Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to consider establishing tomato pulp and ketchup factories in the district on a war footing to save growers from massive losses from sudden drop in rate for their produce and protect traders investing in the crop. 
He said that thousands of jobs could be created in pulp and ketchup factories if established by the government.
