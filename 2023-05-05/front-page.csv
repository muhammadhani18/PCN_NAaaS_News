0,Historic visit steals spotlight from SCO moot,"Jaishankar hosts dinner for visiting dignitaries, no one-on-one meeting with Pakistan FM on the cards.","• Bilawal meets Russian counterpart, underscores commitment to multi-nation forum
• Jaishankar hosts dinner for visiting dignitaries, no one-on-one meeting with Pakistan FM on the cards
• Analysts see FM’s Goa sojourn as ‘multilateral, not bilateral’ visit
NEW DELHI: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari arrived in Goa on Thursday, and the Indian press could help not but notice it — almost to the exclusion of other foreign ministers attending the two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Orga­ni­sation’s (SCO) Cou­ncil of Foreign Ministers.
Reports noted his “Salaam, from Goa” message, a former Portuguese enclave, now a BJP-ruled state, and were nearly unanimous in saying that no meeting between him and his Indian counterpart was on the cards.
The foreign ministers and their delegations are staying at the Taj Exotica in Benaulim, which is also where the SCO meetings are going to be held.
On Thursday night, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar hosted a dinner for the visiting dignitaries. The official engagements begin on Friday with the arrival of foreign ministers and heads of delegations at the meeting venue, followed by a group photo.
The meeting of the Council of Foreign Minis­ters will begin in the morning and by noon, the ‘decision document’ will be signed, which will be followed by a working lunch.
The event will conclude with the signing of a memorandum with New Dialogue Partners. The leaders will then hold various bilateral meetings with their respective counterparts from other nations.
Meeting with Russian FM
After landing in India, Mr Bhutto-Zardari met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday night. According to the Foreign Office in Islamabad, the two discussed bilateral, regional and international matters of mutual interest.

Mr Lavrov was assured that Pakistan would continue to work closely with Moscow to further deepen cooperation in the realms of food security, energy and people-to-people contacts, adding that the SCO had opened “new vistas of cooperation and coordination with Russia”.
Earlier, in a video shared on Twitter, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said he would hold meetings with his counterparts from Russia and Uzbekistan. But would there be a chance encounter with his Indian counterpart, or a courteous handshake, perhaps? No news on that front.
The first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India in almost 12 years, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said he looks forward to constructive discussions with his counterparts from friendly countries.
“I am very happy that today I have arrived here leading the delegation of Pakistan,” he told reporters, adding that he hoped the SCO meeting would be “very successful”.
 






Indian diplomat JP Singh, joint secretary of the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran desk, received Mr Bhutto-Zardari at the airport.
Important alliance
The Pakistani FM said his decision to attend the meeting underlines Pakis­tan’s strong commitment to the SCO charter.
“During my visit, which is focused exclusively on the SCO, I look forward to constructive discussions with my counterparts from friendly countries,” he said.
Analysts such as Michael Kugelman of The Wilson Centre says this visit must be viewed through a “multilateral lens, not a bilateral one”.
Speaking to BBC News, the scholar of South Asian affairs said: “[Mr Bhutto-Zardari] is not going to pursue reconciliation with Delhi. He’s going to participate in a conference of reg­i­onal organisation that holds considerable importance for Pakistan’s interests.”
In his view, skipping the conference would raise the risk of Pakistan being isolated from an organisation that embraces its interests strongly.
This view was lent credence when Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif — currently in London for the coronation of King Charles III — tweeted his support of Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
 






Pakistan was committed to playing its part to advance the shared values of peace and stability in the region, he said, adding: “We are all for win-win understandings based on connectivity, trade and mutually advantageous cooperation”.

1,"Imran shifts TTP talks blame, claims army was ‘on board’",Says the then COAS Qamar Bajwa and ISI DG were part of the decision taken to hold discussion with TTP.,"ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Thursday claimed the military leadership was fully on board in holding parleys with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and blamed the incumbent government’s “negligence” for the group’s resurgence.
He was speaking to reporters after attending the hearing in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on his petitions seeking bail in seven FIRs registered against him at different police stations in the federal capital.
Recently, the military distanced itself from the PTI government’s initiative of holding dialogue with TTP. ISPR chief Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry at his maiden presser recently had said: “Holding dialogue with banned TTP was the decision of the then government of Pakistan and they [previous regime] have openly admitted this as well”.
In response to a question that his government had been blamed for reconciliation with the terrorist outfit that helped them regroup, Mr Khan said the then army chief Qamar Bajwa and ISI director general were part of the decision taken to hold discussion with TTP.

Calls for rallies tomorrow in support of CJP; IHC grants ex-PM 10-day protective bail; JIT fails to serve police notice at Zaman Park

“In fact, we started talks with the Afghan government on their [TTP leaders’] repatriation,” he said.
“We were discussing their rehabilitation and while the talks were in process my government was toppled and this government did not take care about this,” he explained, adding “last year then Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Mahmood Khan raised this issue but his plea fell on deaf ears as nobody bothered about this, hence the situation deteriorated”.
 
 

Mr Khan said he had told the Lahore High Court (LHC) about threats to his life, adding that a senior official of a spy agency had planned to assassinate him twice.
He said no official can act without the consent of his superiors.
Court proceeding
An IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb disposed of seven petitions by Mr Khan. While granting him 10 days’ protective bail, the court directed him to approach the relevant court to file pre-arrest bail.
The court, on another petition seeking Mr Khan’s trial through video link in two more cases, sought assistance from his counsel and adjourned the hearing till May 12.
While the bench was hearing Barrister Salman Safdar’s arguments, the ‘untimely’ intervention of PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry irked the judge, and proceedings concluded on an unsavoury note.
Mr Chaudhry stated that the government had been openly defying the directions of high courts and Supreme Court, but PTI is the only party that is complying with the court’s directions.
He accused the district administration and police of intimidating PTI workers on the pretext of security.
The court observed that district administration and police were responsible for ensuring security and it cannot interfere into their domain.
Seeking a blanket bail granting order for the PTI chairman in all the criminal cases, Barrister Safdar argued that Mr Khan is facing serious threats to his life and it is difficult for him to seek bail from trial courts.
Justice Farooq asked the counsel to cite any such precedence as other suspects would seek similar relief.
Call for rallies
Before leaving Lahore for Islamabad, Mr Khan in a video message asked people to come out on roads to express solidarity with the Chief Justice of Pakistan, protect the Supreme Court and Constitution because a mafia was out to divide the top court and trample the Constitution.
Mr Khan gave the call for rallies in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Peshawar at 5.30pm on Saturday.
JIT fails to serve notice
In a related development, the JIT— probing cases lodged against Mr Khan and other PTI leaders — said that during a visit to Zaman Park they couldn’t get access to the crime scenes due to presence of party workers there.
The JIT officials reported to the police high-ups that they went to Mr Khan’s house as he didn’t appear before the JIT despite several summons to join investigations. The staff deputed at Mr Khan’s residence denied the JIT access to deliver a police notice for the inspection of crime scenes, the JTI said, adding the security staff and employees at Zaman Park were reluctant to receive the notice.
The PTI strongly reacted to JIT’s visit to Zaman Park when Mr Khan was away.
“The CCPO Lahore order for JIT members’ visit to Imran Khan residence is clear violation of the court order,” the PTI stated and recalled that Punjab police had also ransacked Mr Khan’s residence when he had gone to Islamabad for his appearance before the court.

2,Six soldiers martyred in N. Waziristan gun battle,NORTH WAZIRISTAN/PESHAWAR: Six soldiers were martyred and three militants killed during a gun battle in North...,"NORTH WAZIRISTAN/PESHAWAR: Six soldiers were martyred and three militants killed during a gun battle in North Waziristan, near the Pak-Afghan border, the military’s media wing confirmed on Thursday.
The security forces had launched an operation on the intelligence  reports about the presence of militants in the area, according to the  Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
Also on Thursday, security forces claimed to have killed a high-profile  militant in an undercover operation in Dera Ismail Khan. A police officer, SDPO Abid Iqbal, was also injured during the operation.
The exchange of fire took place in the Dirdoni area of Tehsil Ghulam Khan as security forces closed in on the militants’ location. 
The forces gunned down three alleged terrorists while two were injured.
According to the ISPR, the martyred soldiers included Havaldar Saleem Khan, 36, from Tank; Naik Javed Iqbal, 37, from Kohat; Sepoy Nazir Khan, 26, from Bannu; Sepoy Hazrat Bilal, 25, from Mardan; Sepoy Syed Rajab Hussain, 22, from Orakzai; and Sepoy Bismillah Jan, 22, from Khyber.
A sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate any terrorists found in the area, the statement added.
Condemnation
The prime minister, interior minister, national assembly speaker and other political leaders have expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said these “supreme sacrifices” showed the “unwavering national resolve” to root out terrorism. 
“No matter how long the battle, our valiant armed forces, with the support of the nation, will root out terrorism in its entirety,” the PM said in a tweet.
“My profound condolences to the bereaved families & prayers for the departed souls.”
In his condolence message, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said these sacrifices “would not go to waste” as the entire nation stood behind the army in this effort to eradicate terrorism.
PPP President Asif Ali Zardari urged the federal government to bring the terrorists, their patrons, and facilitators to task.
“The nation will never forgive the killers of its brave soldiers,” a statement by the PPP secretariat quoted Mr Zardari as saying.
He also expressed sympathy for the families of the martyred soldiers.
Militant gunned downThe militant, Muhammad Iqbal alias Bali Khiyara, was wanted for numerous acts of terrorism including the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009, and was killed along with his associate.
A senior police official told Dawn that around 21 cases related to sectarian killings in KP and Punjab were also registered against the deceased militant.
He was initially associated with Lashkar-i-Jhangvi but later joined the banned outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which confirmed Khiyara’s killing.

3,PM Shehbaz calls out ‘double standards’ of judiciary,Asks all institutions to stay within their limits and fulfil their constitutional roles.,"LONDON: Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday evening criticised the “double standards” of the judiciary, saying that all institutions should stay within their limits. 
Speaking to reporters outside Avenfield House, the residence of his brother and party leader Nawaz Sharif, the premier said: “Justice should not just be done but should be seen to be done. In the same spirit, the supremacy of parliament and the Constitution must be respected by everyone. The right given to parliament by the Constitution cannot be snatched.”
He called on all institutions to stay within their limits and fulfil their constitutional roles. “This is how Pakistan and its people will prosper. But double standards, wherever they are, are not healthy for any society,” he said.
He said that in the previous government, opposition parties were “jailed in fake cases”.
“There was no one to ask after them, their health or the rights violations against them in jail,” he said and regretted that some members of the previous opposition had been picked up even on the eve of Eid.
In contrast, he said the judiciary was now quickly approving bail applications. “Dozens of bail applications are approved within moments. This is a double standard and is not acceptable to anyone.”
The prime minister is in London to participate in an event for Commonwealth leaders in London on Friday (today) and attend the coronation of King Charles on Saturday.
He met with the elder Sharif on Thursday in a meeting that many speculate would see the brothers discuss the party’s ongoing tussle with the judiciary face-to-face.
Mr Nawaz has also taken the judiciary head-on, criticising the Supreme Court’s decision on Punjab polls and calling for the accountability of senior judges, including the chief justice.

4,"PAC tasked to probe SC judge’s pricey plot, tax details",NA refers the case of Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi to PAC with directive to come up with a report within 15 days.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Thursday referred the case of Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi, who is facing allegations of keeping assets beyond means, to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) with the directive to come up with a report within 15 days containing details of the properties owned by the Supreme Court judge and the tax paid by him.
Deputy Speaker Zahid Akram Durrani referred the matter to the powerful arm of parliament on the demand of Minister for Economic Affairs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq. The PML-N leader had raised the issue on a point of order during the Question Hour as lawmakers continued their assault on the superior court judges in the wake of ongoing executive-judiciary tussle over the issue of elections to the Punjab Assembly.
Having no serious business to do and in an apparent effort to drag the proceedings, the deputy speaker provided free time to members to speak on any subject on points of order.
Taking the floor, Mr Sadiq said various bar councils had filed references to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Naqvi, adding that such allegations were tarnishing the image of judiciary.

Two weeks set aside for inquiry to be carried out with FBR, AGPR help; anomalies in ongoing census echo in house

Mr Sadiq, who served as speaker of the National Assembly under the previous PML-N government, said PAC should seek assistance from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Accountant General Pakistan Revenue to probe the matter.
 
 

He said the investigation must find out sources of the judge’s income “to purchase a plot worth over Rs100 million and carrying out construction on it”. Besides conducting special audit of the matter, he added, the FBR should be asked to also provide details of taxes paid by the judge.
The minister said it was unfortunate that people were pointing fingers at the judges of superior courts because of such allegations, adding the proposed investigation would provide an opportunity to the judge to come clean on the matter.
The deputy speaker immediately referred the matter to the PAC for investigation and audit under Rule 199 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007 with the directive to complete the task within 15 days.
Rule 199 titled ‘Reference to Standing Committee’ reads: “Except as otherwise provided in these rules, the Assembly or the Speaker may remit to the standing committee any subject or matter with which it is concerned and the standing committee shall study such subject or matter with a view to suggest legislation or making recommendations to the Assembly.”
Four references are pending against Justice Naqvi before the SJC in which he has been accused of “misconduct”, “misuse of authority” and for keeping the assets beyond known sources of income. One of the complaints also mentioned a number of audio clips, including the one featuring conversation between the judge and former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi pointing out that the tone of conversation reflected a rather intimate and close relationship between the two.
As many as 17 members spoke on points of order during more than two-hour proceedings and some of them even got the opportunity to speak more than once. Besides lashing out at the judges, the legislators raised a host of issues, including the ongoing digital census and increase in the gas meter rent charges.
Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali of Jamaat-i-Islami and independent MNA Ali Wazir expressed serious concerns over the alleged anomalies in the ongoing census in the country, particularly in Karachi.
Chairman of the Special Committee on Affected Employees Qadir Mandokhel of PPP once again complained that ministries were not implementing the committee’s directives. He especially mentioned the ministries of aviation, railways and information in this regard.
The National Assembly will now meet on Monday afternoon (May 8).
