0,"CEOs pledge fair, not minimum, wages","Big companies for the cause include Unilever, Bank Alfalah, Jazz, the Bank of Punjab, Careem and Foodpanda.","KARACHI: Trade unionists, beware! A new kind of collective bargaining agent (CBA) is in town to replace you. As implausible as it may sound, it’s the CEO you’ve been haggling with for decades.
The minimum wage is a thing of the past, says the new CBA. A full-time job is supposed to lift one out of poverty, not keep them there indefinitely. The latest catchword in the corporate world is fair living wage (FLW), an arbitrary-sounding figure of Rs51,500 a month (for 2022), which is about twice the minimum wage notified by some provincial governments.
In 2020, Unilever Pakistan Ltd made a pledge, without external prodding, that each worker employed directly or otherwise must earn an FLW by 2030. The company is 60pc FLW compliant today.
“We’ll be 100pc FLW compliant in the next 18 months,” said Unilever Pakistan CEO Amir Paracha at a recent roundtable conference held at the multinational’s offices.
By the looks of it, the FLW movement is gaining traction in Pakistan. Big companies that’ve signed up for the cause include the likes of Bank Alfalah, Jazz, the Bank of Punjab, Careem and Foodpanda. Smaller companies, including start-ups, have also joined the roster.
What’s an FLW? It’s a rupee value — calculated by an international body — that socially responsible companies believe every full-time worker deserves to receive as a monthly salary.
“We must share prosperity if the country is to grow,” said Mr Paracha who’s been goading his fellow CEOs into adopting the FLW as a salary benchmark for many years now. “No one can survive at a salary of Rs25,000 a month,” he said.
Mr Paracha’s public advocacy for this cause has earned him the ire of many in the business circles. People have called him “showy” for his pro-worker views, according to one participant of the roundtable.
Lowbrow business owners who dominate the politics of business chambers in the city have privately called Mr Paracha a publicity-seeking, renegade CEO who has defected to the woke and is now being spendthrift with the shareholders’ money.
The issue is so contentious that one group of employers headed by a prominent business leader even went to court against the last increase of a few thousand rupees in the government-notified minimum wage — a move that “surprised” Mr Paracha.
Raising wages isn’t an act of charity, he said. It makes a “compelling commercial case” to pay workers an amount that’s enough to sustain a dignified standard of living. He brought down the attrition rate in the sales staff of Unilever Pakistan from 40pc to 4pc many years ago simply by doubling their salaries in one go, he said.
Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim concurred. “You can’t fly on half an engine,” he said while referring to the underpaid staff that stays with the company but doesn’t perform well for being demotivated.
Speaking on the occasion, a representative of Abhi — a startup that lets employees of its corporate clients access their earned wages before the first day of next month — said workers are under intense financial pressure because of record-high inflation.
Citing the example of a large textile mill in Karachi, he said more than half of its workforce consisting of thousands of employees routinely draws wages in advance to make ends meet. Some of them access their next salaries as many as 20 times in a single month, he said.
One participant asked Mr Paracha and the coalition of “conscientious employers” to come up with a shared symbol to be affixed on the products made by FLW-paying companies. Given a choice, most conscientious consumers will prefer doing business with FLW-paying companies, he said.
Another participant belonging to a media group suggested that FLW-paying companies should also use their marketing and advertising budgets to support newspapers and channels that pay fair wages to their workers.

1,Preferential trade with Turkiye activated,"Duty reduced to zero per cent on 123 tariff lines, including 5 agricultural and 118 industrial products.","ISLAMABAD: Almost after seven years, Pakistan and Turkiye have implemented a preferential trade agreement to boost bilateral trade volume across various sectors.
Both sides notified duty reductions on mutually agreed tariff lines with effect from May 1, an official announcement of the commerce ministry said on Thursday.
Islamabad and Istanbul signed the “Trade in Goods Agreement” in August 2016.
Under the agreement, Pakistan has gained preferential access to the Turkish market under 261 tariff lines covering traditional as well as non-traditional sectors such as leather, rice, dates, mangoes, cutlery, sports goods, seafood, processed agricultural products, rubber tubes and tyres, plastics, and engineering goods.
Pakistan’s export value of these tariff lines stands at $5.1 billion or 16 per cent of the total exports, while Turkish global imports in these products amount to $7.6bn.
Duty was reduced to zero per cent on 123 tariff lines, including five agricultural and 118 industrial products. The current export value of these products is $714 million, while Turkish global imports of these products stand at $3.920bn.
Customs duty on average is 2-3pc. However, the additional customs duty is 20pc for industrial products, which will be reduced. This is one area having the potential to increase exports of non-traditional products.
Whereas concessions on 130 tariff lines have been extended to Türkiye, including products such as black tea, processed food products and flavourings, industrial raw materials and parts of machinery, and parts of electronic equipment. The total export value of these products is $23bn or 12pc of its total global exports. Pakistan’s global imports of these products stand at $6bn.
Pakistan has reduced duty to zero on 16 tariff lines for Turkiye. Pakistan’s global imports of these tariff lines stand at $1.224bn, while Turkish global exports of these products are $2.486bn.
Pakistan exempted duty for Turkiye immediately on cocoa powder, acrylic filament and staple fibre, nonwoven man-made filament, black tea, modems, wire condensers, flavours for the food industry, machines for reception and transmission, enzymes and gum base.
The agreement will open new export opportunities, Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar said in a statement.
Since the signing of a framework agreement on March 22, 2016, both sides have held 14 rounds of bilateral negotiations to identify those products for trade which are not affecting each other’s interests.
In the second phase, Turkiye will reduce the duty to zero per cent on 92 tariff lines during a period between five and 10 years. Pakistan’s export value of these products is $1.608bn, while Turkish global imports stand at $2.084bn.
Turkiye has offered a margin of preferences and tariff rate quota on agriculture products to Pakistan. The categories of products which will get benefit from the concessions are leather, footwear, glass and ceramics, articles of base metal, plastics and rubber, furniture, mattresses and lamps, sports and engineering goods, chemicals and cosmetics, agriculture products and processed agriculture.
While Pakistan will reduce to zero per cent in five to 10 years on 16 tariff lines. Turkish global exports of these tariff lines stand at $2.123bn, while Pakistan’s imports of these products are $684m.
In five years, the duty will be exempted on chocolate crumbs, active yeast, flavouring powders, animal feed, laboratory reagents, clamps of steel, copper wire 6mm, pressure-reducing valves and slide fasteners. In 10 years, duty will be reduced on clips, brackets of iron and steel, mounting, fitting for furniture, parts of sorting, screening, grinding machines, apparatus for transmission of voice, etc.
The commerce minister stressed the need to increase business-to-business interaction for strengthening trade and investment relations between the brotherly countries. He said signifies a notable milestone in the historic brotherly relations between Pakistan and Türkiye and envisages further integration of the markets and business communities of both countries.
The total trade between Pakistan and Turkiye stood at $883 million in the fiscal year 2021-22 with Pakistan’s exports to Turkiye amounting to $366m and Pakistan’s imports from that country amounting to $517m. The balance of trade is in favour of Turkiye with a negative trade balance of $151m in 2021-22.

2,SBP reserves fall by $6m,The central bank has yet not received the promised inflows from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.,"KARACHI: Foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fell by $6 million to $4.46 billion during the week ending on April 28, announced the central bank on Thursday.
Currency experts believe a meagre fall in SBP reserves helped the exchange rate to remain stable for more than a couple of weeks.
However, bankers maintain that the current account surplus of $654m in March was the real support for the exchange rate.
In an interview, former finance minister Miftah Ismail said that April would also bring a surplus that would help to bring some stability to the economy. 
Pakistan has massive curtailed imports, which badly hit the economic growth but improved the balance of payment situation.
What is more concerning for the government is an inordinate delay in signing a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund to unlock a $1.1bn tranche.
Pakistan needs another IMF programme for its future economic stability, as it requires a huge amount of about $35bn for external debt servicing in FY24.
However, the central bank has yet not received the promised inflows from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
The country’s overall foreign reserves were $10.043bn including $5.586bn of commercial banks during the week.
In the preceding week, the SBP reserves had fallen by $30m.

3,SSGCL questions Pakistan Steel’s audited accounts,It is very uncommon for companies to comment on the financial statements of other firms.,"ISLAMABAD: In a rare move, the Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) has alleged that Pakistan Steel Mills’ audited accounts for 2021-22 had violated the current scheme for revival of the PSM approved by its board and the federal government.
In a statement, the Karachi-based gas utility raised questions over the auditor’s report on PSM’s financial statement for 2021-22 but precisely confirmed the auditor’s report. It is very uncommon for companies to comment on the financial statements of other firms.
The PSM’s external auditors — Crowe Hussain Chaudhry & Co — had reported in the financial statement that the PSM management claimed that based on the decisions of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, SSGCL should waive late payment surcharge (LPS) which the gas utility did not accede to and stopped gas supply during the period and filed a suit against PSM for recovery of outstanding bills and LPS in Sindh High Court. 
The PSM also filed a counter suit against SSGCL for Rs38.6bn, claiming damages for losses suffered by PSM owing to the discontinuation of gas supply from June 2015.
The SSGCL challenged the above position but itself confirmed that auditors had fairly reported SSGCL’s position as well. “As per SSGCL record no such ECC decision on the waiver of LPS exists — to be implemented by SSGC”, said the gas company. Strangely though, in the very next line the SSGC claimed that “the referred disclosure is against the very spirit of the current scheme of arrangements approved by the federal government and PSML Board for the revival of PSML”.
The SSGCL claimed that a huge sum of Rs87.131bn (including LPS) was recoverable from PSML while it has been making partial payments after the release of budgetary grants. It said the SSGCL was supportive of the government’s revival plan and still providing 2mmcfd of gas amounting to Rs80-85 million per month to keep its coke oven batteries intact.
Earlier on April 14, the SSGCL wrote that it was ready to issue its no-objection certificate (NOC) for 1,229 acres of PSM land and core pperating assets to Steel Corp (Pv) Ltd based on Rs39.2 million per acre value determined by jointly appointed land valuator – KG Traders — in lieu transfer of 1,228.21 acres of PSM land to SSGCL against settlement of Rs48.15bn including principal and LPS.
The board of directors of PSM refused to accept the unilateral evaluation of its land by SSGCL and expressed great concern “over delay in issuance of NOC for transferring PSM’s core operating assets to Steel Corp (Pvt) Ltd and non-withdrawal of litigation.”
The PSM board asked the SSGC to withdraw its litigation and issue the requisite NOC to transfer the PSM’s Core Operating Assets to Steel Corp (Private) Limited on an emergent basis to avoid further delay of PSM’s revival and privatisation process. 
The PSM’s management believed that not only the land evaluation price offered by the gas company was one-sided and precariously low but even the working for liabilities was unfair and strings attached to the offer were unacceptable.

4,IMF to discuss budget plans in fresh hurdle to funding,"“Historically, the biggest fiscal slippages in Pakistan occur in an election year,” economist Sakid Sherani says.","KARACHI: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is preparing to discuss Pakistan’s budget plans for the coming financial year as part of a process to unlock a crucial financing injection for the cash-strapped nation, the IMF’s country mission chief said.
An IMF review of the budget presents a fresh hurdle before the lender approves the release of pending bailout funds, which are crucial for Pakistan to resolve an acute balance of payments crisis. A staff-level agreement to release $1.1 billion has been delayed since November. The finance ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
“In all IMF programmes, the authorities issue a letter of intent associated with the last review outlining their policy intentions for the period after the programme,” Nathan Porter, IMF mission chief to Pakistan, told Reuters on Thursday.
Pakistan has struggled to strike a deal with the IMF to release funds critical to stabilise the struggling economy.
Economist Sakib Sherani of Macroeconomic Insights said the IMF wants to ensure that the government remains committed to the agreed path of fiscal consolidation as the country prepares for elections later this year.
“Historically, the biggest fiscal slippages in Pakistan occur in an election year,” Sherani said.
It was not immediately clear if the review of the budget would affect the pending ninth review, or would be part of the two reviews that remain after this.
On Thursday, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar reiterated that Pakistan has already taken all the agreed steps to unlock the funding.
Prior to that, the government said that external financing was the last hurdle for the deal. Pakistan is required to give an assurance that its balance of payments deficit is fully financed for the fiscal year ending in June to unlock the next tranche of IMF funding.
The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and China came to Pakistan’s assistance in March and April with pledges that would cover some of the funding deficit. The $1.1bn tranche is part of a $7bn bailout package, which is due to end in June. So far, Pakistan has received $3.9bn. In response to a question about the possibility of combining the 9th and 10th reviews in light of the imminent end of the latest programme, the IMF’s Porter said that the current baseline is to proceed sequentially with reviews.
The country is reeling from an economic crisis with inflation surging to 36.4pc, the highest in its history and the highest in South Asia.
The government has removed caps on the exchange rate, imposed taxes, raised energy tariffs, and scaled back subsidies in an attempt to unlock IMF funding. It has also raised key interest rates to a record 21pc.

Despite a 16 per cent growth in overall revenues in local currency, Jazz’s revenue decreased 20.4pc in dollar terms during January-March, mainly due to a massive depreciation in the rupee.
The company has said that the profit margins have been affected by a significant increase in business costs such as the increase in interest rates, fuel and electricity costs.
