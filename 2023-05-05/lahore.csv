Representing the petition of the college, Advocate Rabbiya Bajwa told the court that the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan issued an NOC to the petitioner/institution but the respondent university refused to issue the affiliation certificate.
She said the university had no power to raise any objection to the affiliation of a college after the issuance of a certificate by the pharmacy council, a regulatory body for pharmacies and pharmacists.
The counsel argued that the university was hiding behind a wrong interpretation of a ban by the HEC on affiliation of newly established colleges.
She asked the court to order the GCUF to grant the affiliation certificate to the petitioner/college without any delay.
Justice Raza Qureshi directed the university to submit a detailed reply to the petition within a fortnight.

7,Zaman Park violence: Lahore High Court seeks SOPs of JIT,IGP assures the bench of fair and free investigation in the cases.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday directed the caretaker Punjab government to submit the standard operating procedures (SOPs) of a joint investigation team (JIT) constituted to investigate the cases of violence and attack on police teams outside the Zaman Park residence of PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
Headed by Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, a full bench was hearing the petitions by PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, Musarrat Jamshed Cheema and Fawad Chaudhry, challenging the constitution of the JIT.
The bench, at the last hearing, had linked the inquiry by the JIT with the final outcome of the petitions.  
Justice Farooq Haider and Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq are the other members of the bench.
Responding to the bench’s queries, Punjab IGP Dr Usman Anwar said the federal government nominated two representatives of the as many institutions falling in its domain as JIT members. He said the JIT would have not survived if the government had not nominated its members.
The IGP said the Zaman Park JIT had been formed under the same procedure adopted in dozens of cases, including the one of Pathan Kot incident.
An additional secretary for home told the court that the government did not nominate representatives from the intelligence agencies but the agencies proposed their officers for the JITs.
Asked about the SOPs of the JIT, the IGP said all members of the investigation team were free to give their independent opinions. He said the investigation of the cases was beyond the scope of a station house officer, therefore, the government formed the JIT.
He assured the bench of fair and free investigation in the cases.
A government’s law officer pointed out that the petitioners had not so far joined the police investigation and were hiding behind the court’s proceedings.
The bench directed the government to submit complete SOPs of the JIT on Friday (today).
The petitioners submitted that the police registered politically motivated cases against the PTI leaders and constituted an illegal JIT for the investigation. They said the police unlawfully inserted provisions of the anti-terrorism law in the cases.
They asked the court to set aside the notification of the formation of the JIT and also the call-up notices issued to them and other leaders of the PTI.
The home department had formed a six-member JIT with SSP Imran Kishwar its convener.
Other members include SP Aftab Phularwan and one each representative from three intelligence agencies.

8,Tandoor owners in Lahore increase roti price while govt looks on,"People criticise the current prices, with roti being sold at Rs20  and plain naan at Rs30.","LAHORE:  Tandoor owners across the city have increased the prices of roti and naan by Rs6 and Rs8 after the city district administration rejected  their demand for new prices to be notified.
Dawn has learned that in posh areas, tandoor owners are charging even higher rates.
People have criticised the current prices, with roti being sold at Rs20  and plain naan at Rs30, claiming that the prices may further increase to Rs25  and Rs35 due to rising flour prices and other issues.
Arshad, a  resident of Mughalpura, expressed his frustration, stating that the cost  of roti has increased from Rs15 to Rs20 and may soon reach Rs25. He  lamented the lack of checks and control on skyrocketing prices, making  life increasingly difficult.
Arslan, a resident of Wahdat Colony,  criticised both tandoor owners and the officials for not taking any  action for the benefit of the poor. He mentioned that a naan, which used  to cost around Rs22, was now being sold for Rs30, and during his visit  to Model Town, he found the price to be Rs35. Similarly, roti is being  sold at Rs25 in that area. He urged the city administration to crack  down on the inflated prices.
There are  approximately 13,000 tandoors and 5,000 dhabas (small  hotels/restaurants) operating in Lahore. Tandoors sell naan and roti,  while dhabas sell roti, cooked vegetables and pulses.
Aftab Aslam  Gill, president of the Mutahidda Nanbai Association, confirmed the sale  of roti (100 grams) for Rs20 and naan for Rs30 in Lahore. He also  acknowledged that the rates in posh localities were higher than in the  rest of the city.
He argued that the city administration had  notified prices of roti and naan as Rs14 and Rs22 in November but had  failed to revise them despite significant increases in flour prices,  tandoors using LPG due to gas load shedding, and other issues.
Mr  Gill stated that when the administration did not revise the rates  despite requests, tandoor owners had no choice but to increase prices on their own due to the rising prices of flour and other items.
He mentioned that the price of a 20kg bag of simple flour recently increased from Rs2,550 to Rs2,650, and with the gas loadshedding, they were forced to use costlier LPG.
Gill informed Dawn that  the association had submitted an application to the Lahore  administration requesting the prices of roti and nan to be increased and  notified at Rs25 and Rs35, respectively.
He said the  association’s representatives had visited the city administration office  a few days ago, but no one met them. He warned that if the  administration continued to neglect their demands, tandoor owners would  have no choice but to increase the rates themselves, considering the  steep rise in flour and other item prices.
A spokesman for the  Lahore administration refuted the notion and stated that the price  control magistrates were taking action against those selling roti and  nan at rates violating the notified prices. He explained that while they  were considering the application from the tandoor owners, no decision  had been made yet to revise the rates due to the increasing flour prices.

Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh expressed his displeasure as a law officer said the former chief minister did not join the investigation of the case despite an order passed by the court the other day.
At this, the judge ordered Buzdar to appear before the investigation team without any further delay. The judge made it clear to the petitioner’s counsel that the investigation could not be halted. The judge would resume further hearing on Friday (today).
On Wednesday, the judge had restrained the ACE from arresting Buzdar in any undisclosed case registered against him and also sought a reply from the agency.
The judge had also directed Buzdar to join the investigation when summoned by the respondent agency.
Buzdar’s counsel argued before the court that the ACE conducted a raid to arrest the petitioner in a case not known to him. He said the agency had not provided the petitioner with any information as to how many cases had been registered against him.
HARASSMENT: The LHC restrained the police and other agencies from harassing PTI leader Murad Saeed and summoned details of the cases registered against him.
Earlier, Saeed’s counsel contended before the court that the petitioner and other leaders of the PTI were being victimized by the police and anti-corruption bodies at the behest of the government.
He said dozens of cases had been registered against the petitioner but no information had been furnished to him.
In addition to the police, the National Accountability Bureau, the Anti-Corruption Establishment and the Federal Investigation Agency have been made respondents in the petition.
Justice Anwarul Haq Pannun restrained the respondents from extending harassment to the petitioner and summoned details of the cases, if any, against him by next week.

LAHORE: Known businessman Abdul Jalil Jamil breathed  his last in the wee hours of Wednesday. He was 78.  
He is survived by his  journalist wife Nusrat Jamil, actor daughter Nadia Jamil and journalist son  Omer Jamil.  
He  was buried in Miani Sahib  and his qul will be held at his Zafar Ali  Road residence between 4pm and 6pm on Saturday  (tomorrow). 
He was a businessman dealing in shipping and chemicals.
Businessman Iqbal  Z Ahmad, a  life-long friend of Jalil Jamil, told Dawn  they had been friends for the last 60 years, since their Aitchison  days.  He said he was always more  than happy to help others and had no  complaints with anyone all his  life. 
He said Jalil Jamil was a loving husband and father. 
Daughter  Nadia Jamil, a  cancer survivor, seconds Iqbal Z Ahmad when she  says her father was  equally into literature, philosophy and all  other refined pursuits of  life. He was a poet, philosopher, hilariously funny, suave and  super  cool father. He taught us power of faith, the joy of  loving animals and  nature, the peace in Sufi poetry, she says.
Tehmina  Durrani,  wife of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, had her own tale of  benevolent  behaviour that the family bestowed on her: “It was Jalil  Jamil, who  made me from a docile, timid Tehmina Khar to a Tehmina  Durrani, who  could fight for life, and found courage to write biography (My Feudal Lord).  I  was completely shattered when divorced by Ghulam Mustafa Khar. It  was Jalil who helped me collect my pieces and  return to life: his house  became my refuge and rehabilitation centre  and here I turned into  Tehmina Durrani, having my own identity.”
Omer Jamil, son  and a  businessman, was also as full of praise for his father as were  others. “He introduced me to the world of literature and  instilled love for  books and philosophy in his children. He would sit  with us randomly and  recite Ghalib or Faiz or Neruda.”
Nusrat  Jamil, his wife for 55  years, thinks equally highly of him but also  laments that he might have  survived had the private hospital he was  taken to had its nebuliser in  proper working condition,  where delayed treatment caused a massive  heart attack, which ultimately  proved lethal. Telling the family to  arrange half a million rupee in  cash instead of charging through debit  or credit cards is something the  hospitals should avoid, she says.

11,Flour mills threaten ‘extreme reaction’ if crackdown continues,LAHORE: Flour millers claim that unlike in the past they are being prevented from purchasing wheat from market...,"LAHORE: Flour millers claim that unlike in the past they are being prevented from purchasing wheat from market surplus, whereas the district administration in Punjab is being made to lift the declared grain stocks lying with the mills. 
The provincial government on the other hand has  ordered a ‘massive’ crackdown against illegal wheat storage and  inter-provincial smuggling.
Speaking at a joint press conference here on Thursday, Pakistan Flour Mills Central Chairman Asim Raza and Punjab Chairman Iftikhar Muttoo said traditionally the flour milling industry, food department and other agencies purchased wheat side by side during the harvesting season. Though wheat crop is bumper this year, the industry is being barred from procuring 2.2 million tonnes of grain from the market surplus that would help stabilise the wheat market and flour prices up till the month of September each year. 
They claimed that the food department is imposing ‘undue’ restrictions on wheat buying this season, while district administration is being forced to seize the already purchased and formally declared grain stocks from the flour mills. 
The government policy, they said, has reduced wheat arrival in the market to the minimum because of which the milling industry is facing difficulties to get the crop for meeting its daily grinding operations, while wheat rates are gradually on the rise and have already reached the level where they should be during the month of September. 
This is also leading to a gradual increase in the flour price to the disadvantage of the consumers, they added. 
They said a meeting of the association members held here earlier in the day appealed to the Punjab government to remove what they said unconstitutional ban on inter-district and inter-province movement of wheat, allowing the industry to purchase its raw material freely and warned of an extreme reaction if these demands were not given due consideration. 
Meanwhile, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar has  ordered a ‘massive’ crackdown against illegal wheat storage and  inter-provincial smuggling.
The instructions have been issued in the  light of a report by the special branch on wheat hoarding and smuggling, a spokesperson for the Punjab  police said here on Thursday.
Following the orders, he said, a  police team in collaboration with district administration and food  department raided a private farmhouse near Head Muhammadwala in  Muzaffargarh and seized 30,000 maunds of illegally stored grain.

They announced the support in a conference jointly organised by Tanzeem Ittehad Ummat, a religious body working for harmony among various schools of thought, in coordination with the Punjab Emergency Operations Centre.
Over 70 leading Ulema supported strategies to speed up polio eradication.
The scholars called upon parents to get their children vaccinated during all anti-polio campaigns. The call was made in a declaration issued by the Ulema after the conference.
“We encourage all families to save their children from all the diseases that will affect their health and to use vaccine for prevention of such diseases. We declare that polio vaccine is allowed religiously and is fully in accordance with the rulings of Shariah,” the statement said.  
“Like other diseases [that] have been eradicated from Earth, we can also eradicate polio. We count on Islamic scholars to inform people and to do effective outreach to protect our children,” said Pir Ziaul Haq Naqshbandi from Tanzeem Ittehad Ummat.
“Effective outreach in communities plays a critical role in polio eradication. We all must be united to protect children from this crippling disease,” said Maulana Waheed Rokhri of the Jamiat Ahle Hadith.
Dr Wasim Ahmad, additional director Expanded Programme on Immunisaiton, said polio eradication campaign will start in Punjab from May 15. 
“I am of the view that if a simple flu cannot be cured with just one doze of medicine, how can we cure polio. More dozes of polio vaccine mean more immunity for children against the disease,” he said.
Maulana Ramzan Sialvi, the Khateeb of Data Darbar, called for upholding the rights of children as envisaged in Islam.
