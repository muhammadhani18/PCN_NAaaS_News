1,Atletico thrash Cadiz to leapfrog Real into second,MADRID: Atletico Madrid scored five for the second consecutive game as they thrashed lowly Cadiz 5-1 in La Liga on...,"MADRID: Atletico Madrid scored five for the second consecutive game as they thrashed lowly Cadiz 5-1 in La Liga on Wednesday to move above their city rivals Real Madrid into second-place in the standings.
With only five games to play, Atletico climbed to 69 points, one ahead of Real, who lost 2-0 at fourth placed Real Sociedad on Tuesday.
Runaway leaders Barca, who moved to 82 points after beating Osasuna 1-0 on Tuesday, will have the chance to clinch their 27th La Liga crown with a win in their next game at city rivals Espanyol on May 14.
It was a great atmosphere at Atletico’s Metropolitano stadium with the team in a rich vein of form after a difficult start to the season.
Atletico, who were eliminated from European competition after finishing last in their Champions League group in November, dropped as low as sixth in the La Liga standings before the World Cup break.
Yet they were a different team this year, led by a brilliant Antoine Griezmann, a key player for World Cup finalists France in Qatar and a leading contender to win La Liga’s player of the season.
Atletico have lost only two La Liga matches after the World Cup break and won 14 of their last 19 league games.
“The break did us a lot of good,” coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.
“The team recovered their enthusiasm, their level. The team attack with enthusiasm, defend collectively and that has made us much better.
Atletico took an early two-goal lead with Griezmann scoring twice after combining well with Yannick Carrasco and Thomas Lemar.Alvaro Morata extended their lead right after the break and Carrasco netted their fourth from the penalty spot after a handball inside the box by a Cadiz defender.
One minute after Anthony Lozano netted for Cadiz, Nahuel Molina rounded off the scoring for the hosts with a close-range strike from a counter-attack.
Earlier, Struggling Valencia earned a 1-1 draw with fifth-placed Villarreal but  remain in 17th place, level on points with Getafe, 18th, who beat Celta  Vigo 1-0.

2,Lazio beat Sassuolo to reclaim second spot,ROME: Goals by striker Felipe Anderson and midfielder Toma Basic earned Lazio a 2-0 home win over Sassuolo in Serie ...,"ROME: Goals by striker Felipe Anderson and midfielder Toma Basic earned Lazio a 2-0 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A on Wednesday, sending Maurizio Sarri’s side back to second place.
Lazio were under pressure following Juventus’ 2-1 victory over Lecce earlier but are back above them with a one-point lead on 64. A draw or a loss against Sassuolo would have given Napoli an unassailable lead before their match at Udinese late on Thursday.
There was confusion after eight minutes when Ciro Immobile was first awarded a goal after a lengthy VAR check, only for it to be disallowed moments later.
However, there was no doubt after 14 minutes when Marcos Antonio scooped the ball over the top and Anderson finished well past goalkeeper Andrea Consigli.
At the end of the first half, Davide Frattesi hit the crossbar from a tight angle, denying Sassuolo an equaliser.
The result was put beyond doubt by substitute Basic when he tapped home a cross two minutes into stoppage time.
Meanwhile, Inter Milan were ruthless at Hellas Verona, causing the hosts to concede more than five goals at home for the first time in Serie A with a 6-0 victory that included two goals from both Edin Dzeko and Lautaro Martinez. Inter are fourth on 60 points.
Elsewhere, Monza dented AS Roma’s push for a top-four finish as Luca Caldirola volley cancelled out Stephan El Shaarawy’s opener to draw the match 1-1 at home. Jose Mourinho’s side are outside the European qualifying places in seventh with 58 points.
AC Milan stumbled against relegation-threatened Cremo­nese at home. David Okereke gave the visitors the lead before Junior Messias equalised with a free-kick three minutes into stoppage time, ending the match 1-1. Stefano Pioli’s side are sixth in the standings on 58 points.
Earlier, Dusan Vlahovic  lashed in what turned out to the winning goal five minutes  before half-time at a sparsely-populated Allianz Stadium. It was his first Serie A goal in nearly three months.
The ex-Fiorentina attacker’s ninth league goal of the season, and his  first since early February, came after Assan Ceesay’s 37th-minute  penalty for the away side had levelled Leandro Paredes’s early  free-kick.
Defeat leaves Lecce four points above the relegation zone, although  their fight for survival was helped by 18th-paced Spezia falling 3-2 at  Atalanta, who move into the Champions League spots. 
Sampdoria slipped closer to Serie B after a 2-0 home defeat to  Torino which ended with on-pitch chaos after former Pietro Pellegri  netted the away side’s second in stoppage time.

Trailing after a Tiago Tomas goal, the Europa League champions scored two goals in five second-half minutes through Evan Ndicka and Daichi Kamada to turn the game.
France striker Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the box with 15 minutes remaining and converted the penalty.
Stuttgart’s Enzo Millot pulled one back but the home side were reduced to 10 men shortly after when Borna Sosa picked up a second yellow.
Frankfurt survived a VAR review for a handball in the penalty area in the seventh minute of injury time to remain on track for a sixth DFB Pokal title.Despite sitting just one spot above the Bundesliga relegation spots on goal difference, hosts Stuttgart came into the match unbeaten in five games under new manager Sebastian Hoeness.
Tomas gave Stuttgart the lead after 18 minutes, smashing the ball past goalie Kevin Trapp at the near post after collecting a cutback from Josha Vagnoman.
Frankfurt emerged from the half-time break a different side and took the lead five minutes in, Kolo Muani finding Ndicka in the box who hammered a low finish to equalise.
Kamada made it two five minutes later with a solo effort, beating several Stuttgart defenders before placing the ball into the left-hand corner.
With 15 minutes remaining, Stuttgart pushed several players forward looking for an equaliser, but the ball fell fortunately for Kamada who ran 50 metres before finding Kolo Muani, who was felled in the box by goalie Fabian Bredlow.
Bredlow escaped with a yellow card but Kolo Muani converted the penalty to give the visitors a 3-1 lead.
Millot scored a deflected goal for the home side soon after but Sosa picked up a second yellow with four remaining for sinking his studs into the foot of Aurelio Buta.
Stuttgart pushed for a late equaliser and had a corner with 15 seconds remaining in injury time and claimed a handball, but the incident survived a VAR review.

MADRID: Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday moved into the Madrid Open semi-finals with a straight sets victory over Karen Khachanov in his final match as a teenager, while Iga Swiatek reached the women’s last four.
US Open winner Alcaraz, who turns 20 on Friday when the last-four ties are played, overturned 4-1 and 5-2 deficits in the second set to defeat 12th-ranked Khachanov, 6-4, 7-5.
“Winning this match will give me a lot of confidence, Karen was at a great level and took me to the limit,” said world number two Alcaraz who unleashed 31 winners.
“It was decided by small details and I am very, very happy to be able to get through this round.”
The top seed triumphed in one hour and 52 minutes and will next face Borna Coric of Croatia who eased past German lucky loser Daniel Altmaier 6-3, 6-3.
“It was pretty tough. The first set as well, it was close,” added Alcaraz whose record on clay this year now stands at 17 wins against one defeat.
“I was in trouble in the second set, a break down and he had two break points to have the second break. So it was really tough for me to come back and he had his chances to win the second set.
“Luckily I knew I was going to have my chances. I just tried to take my opportunities and I’m really happy to get through.”
If Alcaraz lifts the trophy on Sunday in the Spanish capital, he will knock Novak Djokovic from top spot in the rankings simply by playing a match at the Italian Open in Rome next week.
Djokovic missed the Madrid Open with an elbow injury.
Alcaraz blew away Alexander Zverev on Tuesday in a repeat of last year’s Madrid final, but Khachanov put up stiffer opposition.
The Russian, who knocked out compatriot Andrey Rublev this week and also reached the Australian Open semi-finals, showed no fear in the first set despite his opponent’s form.
Eventually, Alcaraz found a decisive break to take a 4-3 lead with a strong forehand which Khachanov could not return successfully.
The Spaniard consolidated and served it out.
In the second set Khachanov broke for a 3-1 lead when Alcaraz went long after saving a first break point.
The Russian forced two more in the sixth game but could not convert either as Alcaraz fought hard to hold.
Alcaraz’s perseverance paid off as he broke with a volley to get back on serve at 4-5.
The Spaniard consolidated his break and then earned another when Khachanov hit the net with an attempted forehand winner.
Aiming for his 10th tour level title the crowd-pleasing home favourite sealed his progress with a powerful forehand drive.
SWIATEK BREEZES INTO LAST FOUR
Women’s world number one Swiatek raced into the semi-finals with a 6-0, 6-3 victory over Croatia’s Petra Martic.
The world number one, playing the event for only the second time, will take on Russian 12th seed Veronika Kudermetova for a place in the final.
Swiatek lost just eight points in a completely one-sided first set before one break of serve in the second set proved enough to send her into a fifth successive WTA Tour semi-final.
The Polish star has now won eight straight matches as she bids to hit top form in time for the start of her French Open title defence later this month.
“I feel like I’m playing better and better every day,” said Swiatek.
“This is pretty great, because I didn’t know if that was going to be possible at the beginning of the tournament.”
Kudermetova ousted world number three Jessica Pegula 6-4, 0-6, 6-4 in a topsy-turvy clash.
The 26-year-old beat the American five-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist to reach a WTA 1000 event semi-final for the first time, recovering after a collapse in the second.
It will be the 26-year-old’s third semi-final appearance of 2023 following Adelaide and Doha.

7,"PSG boosts security after protests target Neymar, Messi","Some protestors, dressed in black, travel to Neymar’s home in Paris where they chant “Neymar, get lost”.","PARIS: Paris St Germain have ordered extra security at the club’s training ground and at the homes of Lionel Messi and Neymar after protests by fans angry over recent results at the Ligue 1 leaders, sources close to the club told AFP on Thursday.
Several hundred PSG supporters gathered outside club headquarters on Wednesday evening where they set off smoke flares and sang hostile chants about underperforming stars Messi, Neymar and Italian midfielder Marco Verratti.
Some of them, dressed in black, then travelled to Neymar’s home in a wealthy suburb west of Paris where they chanted “Neymar, get lost”.
“Paris Saint-Germain condemns in the strongest possible terms the unacceptable and insulting actions of a small group of individuals,” a club statement said on Wednesday evening. “Whatever the differences of opinion, nothing justifies such behaviour.”
Neymar, who has been plagued by injuries at PSG and is out until the end of the season, reacted by writing on Instagram:  “Don’t let people put you in their storm. Put them in your peace.”
The club decided to boost security at its training ground and outside the homes of the players singled out during the protests, two sources told AFP, asking not to be named.
Some of the fans had indicated “they wanted to do the same thing every evening,” one of the sources said.
The protesters left  “calmly, several minutes after their arrival” without any clashes with police, the source added.
Messi’s future at PSG was plunged into doubt on Wednesday after he was suspended for two weeks for travelling to Saudi Arabia to fulfil a commercial role without the club’s permission. The 35-year-old World Cup-winning Argentinian is out of contract at the end of the season, with a host of clubs including Barcelona reportedly keen to sign him.
Messi played the whole game in PSG’s 3-1 home defeat by Lorient in Ligue 1 on Sunday. They remain five points clear of Marseille at the top of the table with five games remaining.

8,Nadeem sacked as NCA director after ‘unsatisfactory performance’,"LAHORE:  The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has terminated the services of Nadeem Khan, the director high performance...","LAHORE:  The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has terminated the services of Nadeem Khan, the director high performance at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), citing lack of performance during the past three years.
The PCB will now advertise the said post to hire a foreign coach. 
Interestingly, the PCB did not issue any press statement regarding the termination of Nadeem’s services.
However, when contacted, PCB chairman Najam Sethi told Dawn that the Interim Management Committee (IMC) was not satisfied with Nadeem’s performance and now the Board would advertise the post.
“In its first meeting [last December], the IMC took a briefing from Nadeem Khan [on NCA], and found its working unsatisfactory,” Sethi said. “Then the Interim Management Committee had decided to curtail the salaries of PCB high officials, [including Nadeem].
“But now the IMC has taken a final decision to terminate Nadeem.”
It may be mentioned here that unofficially Nadeem’s services had been transferred to the PCB women’s wing a couple of months ago, as no formal announcement was made in this regard. However on paper, he was NCA director.
It was learnt that first the IMC had decided to reduce the hefty salaries of some PCB high officials, including Nadeem.
However, first Nadeem refused to accept any reduction in his salary and wanted to continue the lucrative job fetching him around Rs1.5 million per month. Later, he agreed to work at Rs1.3 million but finally the matter was settled at Rs1 million.
The 53-year-old Nadeem, who in a short Pakistan career played two Tests and as many ODIs between 1993 and 1999, was appointed as NCA director by PCB chairman Ehsan Mani in May 2020 in place of Mudassar Nazar, who was not satisfied with that regime.
It emerged that Nadeem’s most noticeable disappointment during his time in office was the failure to complete the elections from club to provincial level in the past three years, in accordance with the new PCB constitution introduced by Mani in August 2019.
Till the appointment of the IMC on Dec 21, 2022, Nadeem could not even complete the registration of clubs across the country, despite hiring a private company for this purpose, which cost millions of rupees to the PCB.
The IMC which was formed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PCB patron, to restore the 2014 PCB constitution for reviving departmental cricket and regions to replace province-based structure, restored the affiliation of the clubs affiliated under the 2014 constitution. As a result, all the work regarding clubs’ registration under 2019 constitution was wasted.
Nadeem, presently on leave, is in England currently and could not be available on telephone call.

9,"With New Zealand series in the bag, Pakistan eye top spot in ODI rankings","“We’ve come close in the series, we just haven’t got over the line but full credit to Pakistan,” says NZ's Tom Blundell.","KARACHI: Having sealed the five-match One-day International series against New Zealand with a 26-run win over the visitors in the third match on Wednesday, Pakistan can now look forward to putting the icing on the cake.
If the Babar Azam-led hosts go onto take the remaining two matches and the series 5-0, they will jump up to the top of the ICC ODI Rankings — an achievement that would boost their confidence ahead of the World Cup later this year.
Confidence, after all, would be the most important for Pakistan going into the showpiece in India. To uphold it, the side will avoid making many changes before the World Cup and back the team combination they have established.
Pakistan lost middle-order batter Haris Sohail to injury just ahead the start of the series and have replaced him with Abdullah Shafique at number four with Mohammad Rizwan dropping to number five. 
There had been concerns over both spots and over the absence of a expert power-hitter in the lower middle order. But a crucial knock by Agha Salman at number six in the third ODI and a quickfire cameo from Shadab Khan put rest to those apprehensions.
“We don’t have enough time to do experiments,” Pakistan opener Imam-ul-Haq, whose contribution of 90 runs proved the match-winning one for Pakistan on Wednesday, said during the post match press conference. “Agha, [Mohammad] Nawaz and Shadab provide enough power-hitting prowess. 
“All we need to do is giving them more confidence. It’s very difficult to come at number five and six and score big runs during the death overs. “Agha chipped in with a crucial 32 today, got two wickets and bowled really well, Nawaz and Shadab are great hitters of the ball, so I think it’s important to go into big events with confidence.”
Imam’s observation hinted Pakistan may not give players on the bench time to prove themselves in the last two ODIs, also set to be played here at the National Stadium on Friday. 
The bespectacled batter, however, believed that Pakistan could be better in the field. They dropped three catches in the third ODI, which could have potentially cost them the series. 
“Our fielding is something that we have talked about recently; it’s not up to the mark,” Imam said. “I’m not giving an excuse but we are playing one-dayers after three months. 
“We have trained really hard in this heat on our fielding and we are hoping for better performances in the fielding department. 
“Fielding and fitness are the departments I feel we can get better in because we have to avoid dropped catches. 
The 27-year-old also felt the Pakistan bowlers needed to be lethal in the middle overs
“Secondly, I feel we aren’t taking enough wickets between the 11th and 35th over,” noted Imam. “In this period if our spinners get wickets I think it will be very helpful for us.”
NZ SEEK CONSOLATION
Pakistan have won an ODI series against New Zealand for the first time in 12 years. But that was also down to the Black Caps squad depleted due to the absence of their first choice players, most of whom are featuring in the ongoing Indian Premier League.
However, the gap in quality is also because Pakistan’s high quality as a white-ball outfit. Despite losing the first three matches, a young New Zealand side punched above its weight to challenge the hosts but couldn’t do enough to get a result.
“I think if you look at the Pakistan side they’re a very good side and we’re missing a few of our senior players,” said New Zealand batter Tom Blundell, who scored his maiden ODI half-century on Wednesday. “We’ve come close in the series, we just haven’t got over the line but full credit to Pakistan.
Debutant all-rounder Cole McConchie battered the Pakistan bowlers for an unbeaten counterpunching 64 off 45, which could have taken the game away from the hosts had it not been for an expert finishing performance by the Pakistan pacers.
“I think if you look at the series, you’ve got a few guys who have been given opportunities and if you look at Cole McConchie today I thought he was outstanding,” said Blundell. 
“It’s tough when you go back-to-back games but there’s a lot of positives throughout the group we just haven’t quite played that perfect performance but we’re going to take a day off tomorrow and reflect on today and hopefully come back stronger and put out some good performances in the last two games.”

10,"As Oltmans comes in for junior hockey squad role, senior team coach Aikman remains unpaid",LAHORE: While renowned Dutch coach Roelant Oltmans took over at the helm of the Pakistan national junior hockey team...,"LAHORE: While renowned Dutch coach Roelant Oltmans took over at the helm of the Pakistan national junior hockey team for a month-long stint leading to the end of the Asia Cup, the fate of the national senior team head coach Siegfried Aikman remains in the balance. 
Oltmans has been hired by the Pakistan Hockey Federation as team consultant for the Junior Asia Cup in Oman, which runs from May 23 to June 1, and as he arrived in the country on Thursday, he would’ve been warned about his compatriot Aikman’s travails. 
Aikman, who was hired in December 2021, hasn’t received his dues for several months due to the ongoing rift between the PHF and the Pakistan Sports Board but Oltmans cut a rather composed figure as he met with the probables attending the camp here at the DHA Club. 
“I have already seen some of the probables in the past and although we have little time until the Asia Cup, I will try to do my best to find out the areas where the players need to improve,” he told reporters. 
Oltmans has coached the national senior team in the past and informed that a “further role with the junior team” could be discussed after the Asia Cup, which acts as a qualifier for the Junior World Cup. 
Aikman, meanwhile, has found the hard way what it entails to be a coach of a hockey team in Pakistan. Although he remained tight-lipped when asked by Dawn about whether he’d received any of his dues, PHF secretary Haider Hussain confirmed that the Dutchman remained the senior team coach “without salary”, citing it was the PSB’s responsibility to pay his salary. 
Aikman was among five coaches hired by the PSB for various sports with his pay package set at US$10,000 per month. “We don’t have the funds to give him his salary,” added Haider. 
No proper agreement between the PHF and the PSB was signed for Aikman’s appointment and once PHF president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar ignored the move by the country’s sports regulatory body to appoint a working committee to oversee affairs of the hockey governing body in July last year, relations between the two were soured. 
Khokhar went ahead and held elections of the PHF, resulting in its denotification by the PSB. 
“It was a wrong move on part of the federal government as it cannot disaffiliate any federation,” former PSB director general retired Col Asif Zaman, under whose tenure Aikman was hired, told Dawn. “After that, it became difficult to pay Aikman as the PHF had suspended its working relationship with the PHF.” 
The PSB is under new leadership with Shoaib Khosa taking over as its director general. “I’m going to get updates on the issue before addressing it,” he told Dawn.

11,Haaland already EPL record-breaker as City march on,MANCHESTER: Erling Haaland has taken just one season to set a new Premier League record of 35 goals in a single...,"MANCHESTER: Erling Haaland has taken just one season to set a new Premier League record of 35 goals in a single campaign to make a mockery of the idea that it takes time for new arrivals to settle in the English top flight.  
The Norwegian powerhouse showed his swiftness of foot and subtlety in front of goal by racing clear and applying a chipped finish to a Jack Grealish pass for City’s second in a 3-0 win over West Ham United on Wednesday that put the English champions back on top of the table.  
In the process the 22-year-old moved beyond the mark of 34 set by Alan Shearer and Andy Cole in the 1990s.  
“It’s a special night and a special moment. I’m really happy and proud. I don’t know what else to say,” Haaland told Sky Sports. “I knew about the record, of course, but we tried to create chances to score and it wasn’t easy because they wanted to defend. We struggled in the first half but they eventually came.”  
The City players formed a guard of honour after the game at the Etihad Stadium, enthusiastically patting Haaland on the head as he ran through in celebration.  
His dad Alfie Haaland, who also played for City, watched from one of the boxes with a wide smile and accepted congratulatory handshakes from everyone around him.  
“He deserved [the honour guard],” manager Pep Guardiola said. “All the team deserved it, because without the team he couldn’t do it, but he’s a special striker. We are very pleased for him, because he’s a joy, not just to work with him, [as] manager, I think everyone is happy to have him with us.  
“I think in football when there is a special occasion, we have to show how special it is, as [we did] today with Erling. To overcome Andy Cole and Alan Shearer — incredible top, top strikers, it’s special.”  
Haaland’s strike rate puts even his much-vaunted predecessors, who played in the era of 42-game seasons, in the shade.  
Shearer started all 42 matches of the 1994/95 season as he fired Blackburn to the title, while Cole made 40 appearances the previous year for Newcastle.  
By contrast, Haaland has reached 35 goals at a rate of one every 72 minutes in just 31 appearances.  
Haaland addressed the team in the dressing room, telling them “I don’t know what more to say but thank you guys so much”.  
He also praised team-mate Grealish for his assist.  
“I spoke with Jack before the game and he said he wanted to do the assist for the record-breaking goal,” Haaland said. “It was a perfect bounce, I didn’t think to chip but the opportunity was there so I did it.”  
Haaland has five more games to extend the record and City’s determination to win the battle among Europe’s elite clubs for the striker’s signature last year has been rewarded in spectacular fashion.  
Pep Guardiola’s men won back-to-back league titles playing largely without an attacking focal point but any suggestion they could be thrown off course by Haaland’s arrival has proved unfounded.  
“I remember [the stories that] he will not adjust to the Premier League,” Guardiola reminded reporters on Wednesday. “We knew he scored goals everywhere and thought he could do it. He understands what we want to do but we have to admit the impact of how he adjusted to the team and the league was so quick. Immediately we saw he is a guy when you provide him balls, he can score all different types of goals.”  
Haaland’s 51 goals in all competitions is firing with City to within touching distance of matching Manchester United’s historic treble of 1998/99.  
The English champions face Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League and take on United in the FA Cup final on June 3.  
“Every game is hard. We didn’t play bad but our structure wasn’t great. We didn’t score in the beginning but we pushed on. I’m really pleased with five games left,” Guardiola, whose side were made to work by an under-manned Hammers to edge one point clear of Arsenal in the title race, said. “It’s another three points and we keep going.”  
Guardiola wore a frown throughout a first half in which his side dominated, twice struck the woodwork but could find no way through West Ham’s massed ranks.  
Anxiety was in the air even after Nathan Ake opened the scoring in the 49th minute but it evaporated when Haaland made it 2-0 in the 70th minute before Phil Foden added the final flourish with a deflected volley five minutes from time. 
In Wednesday’s other game, Liverpool edged out Fulham 1-0 with Mohamed Salah’s 29th goal of the season was the difference between the sides at Anfield. 
Jurgen Klopp’s men have now won five consecutive league games for the first time this season and are refusing to give up the fight for a top-four finish by keeping the pressure on Newcastle United and Manchester United for the final two places in next season’s Champions League behind City and Arsenal. 
Liverpool close to within four points of fourth-placed United, who have two games in hand.
