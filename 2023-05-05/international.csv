0,Jurors see video of Trump mistaking his accuser for ex-wife,Carroll’s lawyers argue that the episode undermines Trump’s argument that Carroll was not his type.,"NEW YORK: Jurors in Donald Trump’s civil rape trial on Thursday saw a video deposition in which the former US president mistook a photograph of E. Jean Carroll, his accuser, for his ex-wife Marla Maples. 
Carroll, 79, has testified that Trump, 76, raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, and then tarred her reputation and career by lying about it online. 
Trump, the front-runner for next year’s Republican presidential nomination, has said he could not have raped Carroll, because “she’s not my type” and has called the case politically motivated. 
He will not testify at the trial and has not been in the Manhattan courtroom so far, but on Thursday told reporters during a trip to Ireland that he would  “probably” attend. 
In a video excerpt of a combative deposition by Carroll’s lawyer Roberta Kaplan played on Thursday, Trump was asked about a black-and-white photograph that shows him speaking to people at an event. 
“It’s Marla,” he said, referring to his second wife. 
When Kaplan asked him if he was saying the picture depicted Maples, Trump’s lawyer Alina Habba said:   “No, that’s Carroll.”   
Carroll’s lawyers have argued that the episode undermines Trump’s argument that Carroll was not his type. 
In the deposition, taken last October at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump reiterated his denials of having raped Carroll, whom he called  “mentally sick”.    
“You know it’s not true too,” Trump said, addressing Kaplan. “You’re a political operative also. You’re a disgrace.”

1,Jury convicts 4 militiamen of seditious conspiracy in US Capitol attack,"US Justice Department pursues criminal charges against more than 1,000 people arising from the Capitol rampage.","WASHINGTON: A jury on Thursday convicted four members of the far-right Proud Boys militia group,  including its former leader Enrique Tarrio, of seditious conspiracy, finding they plotted to attack the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s election victory. 
The convictions after a trial lasting nearly four months handed another victory to the US Justice Department as it pursues criminal charges against more than 1,000 people arising from the Capitol rampage by supporters of  then-president Donald Trump.  
Several members of another far-right militia group, the Oath Keepers, were convicted in earlier trials. 
In addition to Tarrio, Proud Boys members Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl were convicted of seditious conspiracy under a Civil War-era law — a charge that can carry up to 20 years in prison. 
The jury did not reach a verdict on seditious conspiracy or conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding for Dominic Pezzola, the only defendant in the case who did not play a leadership role in the organisation. 
More than 500 people have pleaded guilty to charges brought by the Justice Department relat­ed to the Capitol riot and about 80 others have been convicted during trials. These included Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and several of that group’s members.

2,Kenyan pastor freed on bail over cult massacre,"Prosecutors accuse Odero of links to cult leader Mackenzie, who is in custody facing terrorism charges over the deaths of more than 100 people.","MOMBASA: One of Kenya’s highest profile pastors was released on bail on Thursday after appearing in court in connection with the horrific discovery last month of dozens of bodies in mass graves.
Ezekiel Odero, a wealthy televangelist who boasts a huge following, is being investigated on a raft of charges including murder, aiding suicide, abduction, radicalisation, crimes against humanity, child cruelty, fraud and money laundering.
Prosecutors accuse Odero of links to cult leader Paul Nthenge Mackenzie, who is in custody facing terrorism charges over the deaths of more than 100 people, many of them children, in what has been dubbed the  “Shakahola forest massacre”.
Mackenzie, the head of the Good News International Church, is alleged to have incited his followers to starve to death in order to  “meet Jesus” in a case that has deeply shocked Kenyans. Police had sought to detain Odero, who is popularly known as Pastor Ezekiel, for another 30 days to complete their investigations. But magistrate Joe Omido ordered him released on bail of 1.5 million Kenyan shillings (about $11,000), saying he had to report to police once a week and not speak about the case.
“By failing to provide adequate information on the status of the investigation as ordered by the court, I’m persuaded that the state did not act in good faith in seeking to continue detaining the respondent,” he said.

3,Italian FM calls off Paris trip after French ‘insults’,"ROME: Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani called off a trip to Paris on Thursday, saying the French interior...","ROME: Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani called off a trip to Paris on Thursday, saying the French interior minister had insulted Italy with comments that were highly critical of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. 
The French minister, Gerald Darmanin, had earlier told a radio network that Meloni was “unable to solve the migration problems on which she was elected” and accused her of “lying” to voters that she could end a crisis over growing numbers of boat migrants. 
News of his comments came as Tajani was preparing to fly to Paris to see his French counterpart _ a trip that was aimed partly at improving relations between the two European Union countries that have grown increasingly brittle. 
France swiftly issued a statement in which it sought to reassure Rome of its willingness to work closely with Italy, but it was not enough to persuade Tajani to catch his plane. 
“The insults to the government and Italy uttered by the minister @GDarmanin are unacceptable. This is not the spirit in which common European challenges should be addressed,” Tajani wrote on Twitter. 
It was the latest in a series of clashes between Paris and Rome since Meloni took office last October at the head of a nationalist, conservative government which has a very different world vision to that of French President Emmanuel Macron. 
Darmanin is very close to Macron and lashed out at Rome last November, accusing Meloni’s government of being  “selfish” for refusing to let a charity rescue ship dock in Italy, forcing it instead to head to France.

4,"Six killed in Manipur clashes; Indian troops  evacuate over 7,000","Curfew will run for an indefinite period, says minister","NEW DELHI: Indian authorities deployed hundreds of military personnel and cut off internet services to a north-eastern region on Thursday, after the deaths of six people in violent ethnic clashes.
The troops were sent to the state of Manipur, along the border with Myanmar, after a protest march by tribal groups turned violent on Wednesday.
“Curfew has been imposed... situation is tense but is now under control,” Awangbow Newmai, a Manipur government minister, said. He confirmed the death toll.
The state governor on Thursday issued “shoot at sight orders in extreme cases” to local authorities.

Curfew will run for an indefinite period, says minister

“We are working on a war footing with army and paramilitary troopers deployed in strength to defuse any kind of communal clashes, protests, and blockades,” a senior police officer, who sought anonymity, said from the state capital of Imphal.
The Indian defence ministry tweeted that security forces had evacuated at least 7,500 people from areas of the state affected by the violence.
In a social media post, N. Biren Singh, the chief minister of Manipur, pleaded with joined hands for people to maintain peace and harmony, adding that “precious life” had been lost in the clashes.
“We are committed to protect the lives and property of all our people. Long term grievances of different communities will also be suitably addressed in due course in consultation with the people and their representatives,” Singh said.
Tuesday’s march in the Churachandpur district was called by a students’ union, the All Tribal Students’ Union Manipur (ATSUM), to protest against a demand by the majority, non-tribal Meitei community for the status of a Scheduled Tribe (ST).
Under Indian law, members of such tribes are given reserved quotas for government jobs and college admissions as a form of affirmative action to address structural inequality and discrimination.
“The situation is tense but we are trying to engage community leaders in a dialogue process,” the district magistrate in the area, Sharath Chandra, said.
That would help bring the situation under control, in addition to security measures taken to deter violence, he added.
Television channels broadcast images of both tribes, who make up about 40 per cent of the state’s population of 3.6 million, and Meiteis burning tyres on roads and setting fire to some houses in parts of the state.

5,What will the Artemis Moon base look like?,"COLORADO (US): The next time Nasa goes to the Moon, it intends to stay. Under the Artemis programme, the US space...","COLORADO (US): The next time Nasa goes to the Moon, it intends to stay. Under the Artemis programme, the US space agency plans to maintain a human presence, for the very first time, on a celestial body other than Earth.
But building a lunar base is no small feat. It will need power generators, vehicles and habitats, and the space industry is racing to meet the technological challenges.
“It’s the Super Bowl of engineering,” Neal Davis, lead systems engineer for the Lunar Terrain Vehicle at space company Dynetics, said.
Dynetics revealed its prototype design for a Moon rover last month at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. But it probably won’t be until later Artemis missions — 7 onwards — “where we’re starting to look at adding permanent habitations on the surface,” said Nasa associate administrator Jim Free.
Artemis 3, the first planned landing, won’t happen until later this decade, so habitat building wouldn’t start before the 2030s.
The base would likely comprise multiple sites, he added, to diversify the targets of scientific exploration and to offer more flexibility for the landings. Despite this distant timeline, companies are already chomping at the bit.
“Step zero is communications,” Joe Landon, CEO of Crescent Space, a new subsidiary of Lockheed Martin dedicated to lunar services, said.
“Think about when you move into a new apartment, you’ve got to hook up your phone and your internet first.” Starting out with a pair of satellites, the company wants to become the Moon’s internet and GPS provider.
This would relieve the strain on Nasa’s Deep Space Network, which threatens to overheat in the face of all the upcoming missions, including private ones.
Landon estimates the value of the lunar market will be “$100 billion over the next 10 years.” Next up: switching on the lights. Astrobotic, with 220 employees, is one of three companies selected by Nasa to develop solar panels.
They need to be placed vertically because at the Moon’s south pole — the intended destination because it has water in the form of ice — the Sun barely peeps above the horizon.
About 60 feet high, the Astrobotic panels will be connected by cables running several kilometers, said Mike Provenzano, the company’s director of lunar surface systems.

6,"11,000 stolen artefacts seized in Europe crackdown","Items recovered include 77 ancient books in Italy stolen from monastery, thousands of historic coins in Poland and 48 religious sculptures."," 

A view of a marble bust believed to represent Salonia Matidia, niece of Roman emperor Trajan, which was among the stolen artefacts that were recovered during a crackdown on international art trafficking, at an unknown location in Spain.—Reuters

PARIS: Law enforcement officials across Europe arrested 60 people last year in a crackdown that retrieved over 11,000 trafficked artworks and artefacts including ancient books, sculptures and coins, Interpol said on Thursday.
As part of an annual operation codenamed Pandora VII, forces led by Spain’s Guardia Civil police swooped on the art criminals from Septem­ber 13 to 24 last year in a slew of European nations, the international police cooperation body said.
The items recovered included 77 ancient books in Italy stolen from a monastery, thousands of historic coins in Poland, and 48 religious sculptures and other artefacts in Portugal, believed to have been nabbed in a string of church robberies in the 1990s and early 2000s.
In all, police from 15 countries took part: Austria, Bosnia and Herze­govina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden.
France-based Interpol oversaw coordination between the different forces, along with the EU law enforcement cooperation agency Europol.
“Some 130 investigations are still ongoing, as a result of which more seizures and arrests are anticipated as investigators around the globe go after those spoiling and destroying cultural heritage,” Interpol said in a statement.
Pandora operations to recover stolen art and artefacts have been carried out every year since 2016.

7,Raisi calls  Syria trip a ‘turning point’,Raisi says Iran and Syria have signed 15 “cooperation documents”.,"DAMASCUS: Iran’s president on Thursday hailed his visit to Damascus as a “turning point”, after Tehran’s support helped Syria retake most of the territory it lost in 12 years of war.
Ebrahim Raisi’s two-day trip is the first such visit to Tehran’s close ally since 2010, and gives Iran a leading role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad seeks to focus on reconstruction, despite Western sanctions on both countries.
“This trip will be a turning point in Iran-Syria relations and will have an effect on the region and the trade and economic relations of the two countries,” Raisi said during an event for businessmen.
His visit comes weeks after Iran and its arch-rival Saudi Arabia agreed to restore ties, prompting regional capitals to re-engage with the internationally isolated governments in Damascus and Tehran.
“In no way do we consider the level of economic activity between Iran and Syria to be proportional to the level of political relations between the two countries,” Raisi said.
“We believe that there should be a leap forward in commercial relations.” Iran has long propped up Damascus with economic and military aid, including bringing in the powerful Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to fight alongside Assad’s forces.
The Syrian conflict erupted with the repression of peaceful protesters in 2011, and has killed more than 500,000 people and displaced millions. Large parts of the northern Syria are still outside government control. Assad is eyeing reconstruction deals to revive the country’s devastated economy and infrastructure.
Raisi said Iran and Syria had signed 15 “cooperation documents” which would allow “both countries to open a new chapter in economic relations”.
On Wednesday, Raisi and Assad signed memoranda of understanding on “long-term strategic cooperation”, covering fields including oil, aviation, railways and agriculture.
Earlier on Thursday, Raisi called for meetings with what Iran’s IRNA news agency called “Palestinian resistance commanders”. Tehran has long provided logistical and military support to factions fighting its arch-foe. Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes against Iran-backed forces in Syria since 2011. While rarely commenting on such raids, Israel has repeatedly warned it will not allow Iran to extend its footprint there.
“The unity and cohesion of the resistance forces, the region and the Islamic world is necessary to speed up the defeat of the Zionist regime,” Raisi said, referring to Israel.
He also met foreign minister Faisal Mekdad, who briefed him ahead of a meeting with his Russian, Turkish and Iranian counterparts in Moscow to discuss Syria-Turkiye normalisation efforts.
Damascus is a staunch ally of Moscow, which intervened in the civil war in 2015, using its air power to support the government’s struggling forces. Turkiye, meanwhile, backed rebel efforts to topple Assad. Raisi praised Assad on Wednesday for “achieving victory” in the country’s war.
As Syria slowly emerges from regional isolation, Assad is hoping that full normalisation of ties with wealthy Gulf monarchies and other Arab states will also help finance reconstruction.

8,Scientists find chemical that stops locust cannibalism,WASHINGTON: Plagues of locusts that darken the skies and devastate all things that grow have been recorded since...,"WASHINGTON: Plagues of locusts that darken the skies and devastate all things that grow have been recorded since Biblical times, and today threaten the food security of millions of people across Asia and Africa.
But a new finding reported on Thursday — of a pheromone emitted by the insects to avoid being cannibalised when in a swarm — could potentially pave the way to reining in the voracious pests.
Study leader Bill Hansson, director of the Max Planck Institute’s Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology, said that the new paper, published in Science, built on prior research that found swarms are directed not by cooperation — but actually the threat of consumption by other locusts.
While repulsive to modern humans, cannibalism is rife in nature — from lions that kill and devour cubs that are not theirs, to foxes that consume dead kin for energy.
For locusts, cannibalism is thought to serve an important ecological purpose.
Migratory locusts (Locusta migratoria) occur in different forms and behave so differently that they were, until recently, thought to be entirely different species.
Most of the time, they exist in a “solitary” phase keeping to themselves and eating comparatively little, like timid grasshoppers.
But when their population density increases due to rainfall and temporarily good breeding conditions, which is followed by food scarcity, they undergo major behavioural changes due to a rush of hormones that rev them up, causing them to aggregate in swarms and become more aggressive.

The jury in Manhattan federal court determined that heirs of “Let’s Get It On” songwriter Ed Townsend had not proven that Sheeran, his label Warner Music Group and his music publisher Sony Music Publishing had infringed their copyright interest in the Gaye song. Sheeran hugged his attorneys in the courtroom after the verdict was read.
“It’s devastating to be accused of stealing someone else’s song when we’ve put so much work into our livelihoods,” Sheeran said outside the courthouse following the verdict.
“I want to thank the jury for making the decision that will help protect the creative process for song writers here in the US and all around the world,” Sheeran added.
The verdict came after six days of trial and less than three hours of deliberations.

10,"Amid global strife, SCO ministers to focus on consolidating group","India looking to push through proposals to make Russia, China-led multilateral organisation ‘more inclusive’","NEW DELHI: As foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) began their informal meetings in Goa on Thursday, the stark background remains one of strife in Europe, Middle East, South China Sea, South Asia, as well as flare ups in Africa and elsewhere.
Given the involvement of Russia and China, the founders of the group, Ukraine would be lurking close to the discussions, analysts say. 
The theme of India’s Chairmanship of SCO in 2023 is ‘SECURE-SCO’, and India says it attaches special importance to SCO in promoting multilateral, political, security, economic and people-to-people interactions in the region.
“The ongoing engagement with SCO has helped India promote its relations with the countries in the region with which India has shared civilisational linkages, and is considered India’s extended neighbourhood,” said an official statement.

India looking to push through proposals to make Russia, China-led multilateral organisation ‘more inclusive’

“SCO pursues its policy based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, non-interference in internal affairs, equality of all member states and mutual understanding and respect for opinions of each of them,” it added.
Since becoming a full member of the SCO in 2017, India has been nudging the bloc to add ‘English’ as an official language of communication. 
The first such proposal was placed in 2020, necessitated by the inclusion of India and Pakistan as full members to a grouping that has had only Russian and Mandarin as the official and working languages of the bloc, which was founded by Russia, China and four Central Asian nations where Russian language is widely in use.
Since its inception in 1996, SCO has grown, expanded, and emerged as one of the largest regional organisations. SCO member countries account for about 30 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of the world’s population.
On the agenda for the SCO under India’s presidency will also be modernisation of the grouping with focus on advanced technology and digital infrastructure. 
The agenda also includes discussions with regional counterparts on various regional, security, and political issues.
The SCO says it has persistently promoted the strengthening of collaboration on issues pertaining to regional security, defence, and combating terrorism, among others.
Reports say India was holding three bilateral meetings - with SCO Secretary-General Zhang Ming during the first half of Thursday, with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov around 3pm, followed by a bilateral meeting with Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang. Mr Jaishankar is expected to hold other bilateral meetings on Friday, but there is only speculation if Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is among them.
Mr Bhutto is attending the SCO meeting at the invitation of Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who has effectively brushed off the prospects of talks with his Pakistani counterpart. But he spoke to his Chinese counterpart, as he would with others. 
As members of the same SCO, perhaps, India and Pakistan might ponder some beginning, shepherded by a Russian or a Chinese friend? It could be the more discreet thing to do, then ignoring each other because polarised elections are being held in Karnataka.

11,"Jamaica, Belize eye severing links with UK monarchy",LONDON: Jamaica and Belize are both on course to ditch Britain’s King Charles III as their head of state and ...,"LONDON: Jamaica and Belize are both on course to ditch Britain’s King Charles III as their head of state and become republics, leading politicians said in interviews on Thursday.
The comments come just before the British monarch, who ascended the throne after his mother Queen Elizabeth II died last year, is formally crowned at London’s Westminster Abbey on Saturday.
Jamaica and Belize are former UK colonies in the Caribbean that have been independent for decades. But, like 12 other Commonwealth nations outside Britain, they retained the UK sovereign as head of state.
In an interview with Sky News, Marlene Malahoo Forte, Jamaica’s minister for legal and constitutional affairs, said Charles’s coronation has accelerated her nation’s plans to become a republic.
“Time has come. Jamaica in Jamaican hands,” she told the British broadcaster.
“We have to get it done, especially with the transition in the monarchy. My government is saying we have to do it now.” Malahoo Forte said Jamaica could hold a referendum as soon as next year.
She noted it has a “complex” relationship with Britain and becoming a republic would be “saying goodbye to a form of government that is linked to a painful past of colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade”.
Belize Prime Minister John Briceno meanwhile told The Guardian it was “quite likely” his country would be the next to quit the Commonwealth realm.
He said “there is no excitement” among his compatriots for the coronation.
Briceno sharply criticised UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s refusal to say sorry publicly for Britain’s historical role in slavery.
“He has a moral responsibility to be able to offer at the very least an apology,” Briceno told the British newspaper from the Belizean capital, Belmopan.
The government last year passed legislation creating a constitutional commission, which convened in November, to consider instituting various reforms, including becoming a republic.
Its recommendations, reportedly due next year, could be put to a referendum, but Belize’s parliament could also simply vote to remove the UK monarch as head of state.
Since ascending the throne Charles has sought to put the 56-nation Commonwealth which he heads at the heart of his reign.
He is also supporting research into the historical links between the monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade, Buckingham Palace revealed last month.
But there are questions about whether he can inspire the same respect and devotion as his mother, who ruled for a record 70 years.
During a rocky Caribbean tour by Charles’s elder son Prince William and his wife Kate in March last year, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness said his country was “moving on”.
The royal couple faced calls to apologise for the slave trade that helped make past British royals’ fortunes, and were accused of appearing “tone deaf” over elements of the visit.
The Caribbean island of Barbados became a republic in 2021.
Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda — another Commonwealth realm — said he aims to have a referendum on the issue within three years.
