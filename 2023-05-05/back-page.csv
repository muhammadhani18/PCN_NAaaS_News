0,ACE ‘sorry’ for late-night raid on Parvez Elahi’s home,LHC asks officials to submit apology in writing; former Punjab CM gets bail till May 11 in terror case.,"LAHORE: After the Lahore High Court (LHC) directed officials of the Anti-Corruption Establishment to apologise to PTI leader Parvez Elahi over a raid at his residence last week, ACE Additional Director General Waqasul Hassan tendered a vague apology on Thursday.
In a press conference held here, the ACE official said he was tendering an apology on the order of the high court.
“If through my words, contempt of court is committed, I apologise before everyone,” Mr Hassan said, without explicitly stating that his apology had come on court orders in connection with a raid at the residence of Mr Elahi.
The ACE and police officials had stormed the residence of the former chief minister in Lahore last week to arrest him in a corruption probe despite the claim of the latter that he had secured a pre-arrest bail from the court till May 6. Subsequently, Mr Elahi filed a contempt petition in the high court against the ACE raid.

LHC asks officials to submit apology in writing; former Punjab CM gets bail till May 11 in terror case

The ACE official justified the operation at Mr Elahi’s residence, saying: “The ACE and police had to launch an operation at Mr Elahi’s residence after stones were pelted on them from inside his house.
He parried a question whether the operation was launched at Mr Elahi’s residence on the order of the government or ‘someone else’. The federal government had distanced itself from the raid the very next day.
When asked why ACE was fixated on only PTI leaders, Mr Hassan said: “Those who have committed corruption will have to face the law. However, the PML-N has already gone through their cases (in ACE).”
The PTI accused caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi of targeting the PTI leadership. Mr Naqvi had also faced strong criticism from the PML-Q for raiding the residence of Chaudhry Shujaat in a bid to arrest Mr Elahi. Although Naqvi had visited Shujaat Hussain on Wednesday and apologised for the police raid, the interim CM said he was in Saudi Arabia when the operation was launched.
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said the apology tendered by the additional director general was not enough. “The Lahore High Court needs to send some such Punjab government officials to jail, otherwise this circus of maligning people will continue,” he said. The PTI added the officials, who arrested Hassaan Niazi despite bail, would also be held accountable.
Elahi gets bail
An anti-terrorism court also granted interim pre-arrest bail to PTI central president in a case of offering resistance and attacking a police team that raided his house to arrest him.
Mr Elahi appeared  before the court and his lawyer stated that the Ghalib Market police  registered the case purely on political grounds.
He said the petitioner  was ready to join the investigation but police were bent upon arresting  him. Judge Ijaz Ahmad Buttar granted pre-arrest bail to Mr Elahi till  May 11 and restrained the police from arresting him. The judge also  directed the petitioner to join the police investigation.

1,Nato plans liaison office in Japan,"TOKYO: Nato is planning to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, to facilitate consultations in the...","TOKYO: Nato is planning to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, to facilitate consultations in the region, Nikkei Asia reported has, citing Japa­nese and Nato officials. 
China strongly reacted to the move on Thursday, sa­y­ing “high vigilance” was needed in the face of Nato’s “eastward expansion”. 
The liaison office will enable discussions with Nato’s security partners, such as South Korea, Australia and New Zeal­a­nd, with geopolitical challenges from China and Russia in mind, the media outlet reported. 
Asked about the report, Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu said the alliance would not go into details of Nato allies’ ongoing deliberations. 
“Nato has offices and liaison arrangements with a number of international organisations and partner countries, and allies regularly assess those liaison arrangements to ensure that they best serve the needs of both Nato and our partners,” she said. 
Japanese foreign ministry spokespeople were not available for comment. 
The Nikkei Asia report said the proposed office is due to open next year in Tokyo.
Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said Asia was a “promising land for cooperation and development and should not be a battle arena for geopolitics”. 
“Nato’s continual eastward expansion in the Asia-Pacific, interference in regional affairs, attem­pts to destroy regional peace and stability, and push for bloc confrontation calls for high vigilance from countries in the region,” Mao told a regular press conference.

2,Sindh reports its first case of mpox viral infection,KARACHI: Authorities in Sindh on Thursday confirmed the first case of mpox (previously known as monkeypox) in the...,"KARACHI: Authorities in Sindh on Thursday confirmed the first case of mpox (previously known as monkeypox) in the province, taking the national tally to three.
According to the provincial health department, the patient, 36, had arrived from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He is currently under treatment at Karachi’s Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where his condition was said to be stable.
The patient, a resident of the Johi area of Dadu district, has been working as a driver in the Gulf nation.
He initially developed a low-grade fever in Makkah on April 20 and skin lesions a few days later, according to health department officials.
“He was treated as a suspected case of monkeypox soon after he arrived in Karachi on May 3. Currently, he has mild fever on and off with cold at night and lesions all over the body, particularly in the genital area,” an official told Dawn.
He is being treated symptomatically, as there was no specific treatment for the disease, according to an official.
The authorities are tracing people who came into the patient’s contact and he would remain quarantined till his symptoms are cleared.
In a tweet on Thursday, the National Institute of Health (NIH) said that so far three mpox cases have been reported.
The federal health ministry, along with the National Command and Operation Center was vigilantly monitoring the situation, while keeping all the relevant stakeholders on board for ensuring preparedness, timely response, and containment of mpox cases in Pakistan, the NIH said.
According to officials, the two previous cases, reported in Islamabad, have now fully recovered.
Health authorities have been on alert since the first case was reported last month. 
All three patients who tested positive for the virus had arrived from Saudi Arabia. 
So far, there have been no signs of local transmission of the virus, health authorities have said.
Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with someone infectious, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals.
According to the WHO, mpox is a viral illness. Common symptoms of the illness are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last two to four weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes.

3,"Israel kills three suspected of role in murders of British woman, daughters",Palestinian woman shot dead after ‘stabbing’ Israeli soldier,"NABLUS: Israel said its security forces shot dead three Palestinians blamed for killing a British-Israeli woman and two of her daughters last month, in a raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.
Two suspects in the killings and a third man accused of helping them were killed in a joint operation in Nablus by the army, police and Shin Bet security service, a statement said.
Palestinian group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said all three men killed in what it termed an “assassination” were from its ranks, hailing them as “heroes of resistance”. Israel had identified them as the “murderers of Leah, Maia and Rina Dee” who died after the April 7 attack on their vehicle near Hamra in the Jordan Valley, the Shin Bet said, using their Hebrew names.
The army said troops recovered two M-16 assault rifles and an AK-47 from the apartment where the suspects were holed up.

Palestinian woman shot dead after ‘stabbing’ Israeli soldier

As the Israeli forces entered the city, clashes erupted with groups of Palestinians who threw stones at military vehicles. An AFP photographer heard gunfire erupt near the Old City around 7am local time (0400 GMT) as dozens of Israeli army vehicles raced to the scene from multiple directions.
The Lions’ Den militant group claimed its fighters were involved in the clashes and had attacked the Israeli forces with “bullets and explosive devices”.
Huge crowds later gathered in central Nablus for the funerals of the three men, their bodies wrapped in the green flags of Hamas. The Palestinian health ministry confirmed three people had been killed in the morning raid in the Old City of Nablus.
“Two of the martyrs have completely distorted features due to the intensity of the shooting, which makes it difficult to identify them,” the ministry said.
Hours later, in the town of Huwara, south of Nablus, a Palestinian woman was shot dead after attempting to stab an Israeli soldier, the army said. It added that a soldier was “lightly injured” in the alleged attack.
Iman Odeh, 26, was “killed by a bullet to the chest fired by the occupation soldiers in Huwara, south of Nablus,” a Palestinian health ministry statement said.
The Nablus raid came just days after violence flared along the Gaza border following the death of a Palestinian hunger striker in Israeli custody on Tuesday.
Palestinian militants fired more than 100 rockets from Gaza in response to the death of Khader Adnan, 45, a leading figure in Islamic Jihad in the West Bank, who died in prison following an 87-day hunger strike.
Israel launched tank fire and air strikes on Gaza which the army said targeted Hamas military sites, killing a Palestinian man.
The latest violence brings to 106 the number of Palestinians killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so far this year.

4,Biden warns of sanctions on Sudan as latest truce unravels,"UN preparing for outflow of 860,000 people from war-torn country.","KHARTOUM: US President Joe Biden on Thursday threatened to impose new sanctions over Sudan’s conflict, saying the fighting “must end”, as gunfire and explosions rocked Khartoum for a 20th straight day. 
Hundreds of people have been killed in Sudan since the fighting between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan’s forces and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo’s Rapid Support Forces began on April 15 over a dispute on the planned integration of the RSF into the regular army. 
As the latest ceasefire expired at midnight, the army said it was ready to abide by a new seven-day truce, but there was no word from its foes in the paramilitary RSF.
Biden signed an executive order on Thursday that broadens authority to impose sanctions on those responsible for the violence, although it does not name potential targets. 

UN preparing for outflow of 860,000 people from war-torn country

The US leader said in a statement that those facing the sanctions were “individuals responsible for threatening the peace, security, and stability of Sudan; undermining Sudan’s democratic transition; using violence against civilians; or committing serious human rights abuses”. 
“The violence taking place in Sudan is a tragedy — and it is a betrayal of the Sudanese people’s clear demand for civilian government and a transition to democracy. It must end,” he said. 
Within hours of the latest supposed ceasefire taking effect, witnesses in Khartoum reported loud explosions and exchanges of fire on the streets around dawn and clashes during the day in the city of five million people. 
The foreign ministry later accused the RSF of attacking the Indian embassy in Khartoum, the latest in a spate of such incidents which the diplomatic mission did not immediately confirm. The fighting has killed about 700 people so far across Sudan, most of them in Khartoum and Darfur, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. 
‘Peace at stake’ 
The UN refugee agency said it was preparing for an outflow of 860,000 people from the north African country, adding $445 million would be needed to support them just through October. 
“The needs are vast, and the challenges are numerous. If the crisis continues, peace and stability across the region could be at stake,” said Raouf Mazou, the UNHCR’s assistant chief of operations. 
More than 100,000 people have already fled Sudan since the fighting erupted.
On the day the fighting began, Burhan and Daglo had been due to meet with international mediators to discuss the RSF’s integration into the army — a key condition for the transition to democratic rule. Instead, Khartoum awoke to the sound of gunfire ringing through the streets.
The UN’s top humanitarian official, Martin Griffiths, on Wednesday visited Sudan to try to negotiate safe passage for aid and aid workers, after six trucks laden with food supplies from the World Food Programme were looted on their way to the war-torn western region of Darfur.

5,Russia accuses US of masterminding drone attack on Kremlin,"Washington calls Moscow’s claim ""lies, ludicrous"".","MOSCOW: Moscow on Thursday accused the US of masterminding a drone attack on the Kremlin, a charge denied by Washington, and said Ukrainian sabotage on Russian territory had reached “unprecedented momentum”. 
Moscow said President Vladimir Putin was working from the Kremlin the day after the attack, which it said was a Ukrainian attempt to kill him. 
“Decisions on such attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
“Kyiv only does what it is told to do... Washington should understand clearly that we know this,” he said. Ukraine has denied responsibility, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying, “We do not attack Moscow or Putin”. 

Washington calls Moscow’s claim ‘lies, ludicrous’

The US has also denied any involvement. “Peskov is just lying there, pure and simple,” John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said on MSNBC. 
“Obviously it’s a ludicrous claim,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. “The United States has nothing to do with it. We don’t even know exactly what happened here, but I can assure you the United States had no role in it whatsoever,” Kirby said on CNN. 
Kirby said the United States does not encourage or enable Ukraine to strike outside its borders, and does not endorse attacks on individual leaders. 
Throughout its more than year-long offensive in Ukraine, Moscow has maintained that Kyiv is taking orders from the US — accusing the West of leading a war against Russia by proxy. 
Another Ukraine ally, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow “not to use this alleged attack as an excuse to continue the escalation of the war”. 
‘Unprecedented’ sabotage 
The Kremlin attack came as Russia prepares to mark one of its main holidays of May 9 — celebrating the Soviet victory over the Nazis — with a traditional military parade on Red Square. 
It came after five days of apparent sabotage attacks, including trains derailed by explosions and massive fires in annexed Crimea. 
On Thursday, Russia’s southern Krasnodar and Rostov regions, both near Ukraine, reported drone strikes that caused fires. And early Thursday evening, Russia-installed authorities in Crimea, a peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, said their forces had downed a drone near an airbase in the region. 
The Kremlin has insisted Moscow’s May 9 parade will go ahead, despite the attacks in border regions and in the heart of Russian power, but under “strengthened” security. 
Russian television on Thursday showed Putin in the Kremlin for the first time since the drone attack. The Russian leader does not plan “any address on this topic”, said his spokesman. 
Moscow did however acknowledge that the country was facing an “unprecedented” wave of sabotage. 
Russia has opened a terrorism probe into the Moscow attack. 
It has not released official images of the attack. Unverified social media images showed a drone hitting the Kremlin Senate building. 
Peskov said “two copper sheets” on the dome of the 18th-century building had been damaged by fire. “They have been or will be replaced, everything will be like new. There is no other damage.” 
‘Criminal actions’ 
As Moscow accused the US of planning the Kremlin attack, Ukraine’s Zelensky arrived on a surprise visit to The Hague. 
He visited the International Criminal Court, which in March issued an arrest warrant for Putin over the alleged illegal deportation of Ukranian children.
“We all want to see a different Vladimir here,” Zelensky said, referring to the Russian President, his namesake, who he believes “deserves to be sanctioned for his criminal actions here, in the capital of international law”. 
A special tribunal should be created to hold Russia to account for its “crime of aggression”, he said. 
“There should be responsibility for this crime. And this can only be enforced by the tribunal,” Zelensky told diplomats and officials at the court. 
The Netherlands has pledged both financial and military support to Ukraine since Russia launched its offensive in February 2022.
Zelensky, who also met Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, said Ukraine was “realistic” that it would not be able to join Nato while still fighting Russia.
“But we want a very clear message that we will be in Nato after the war,” he said. 
Putin has used Ukraine’s wish to join the alliance to justify launching his offensive. 
Intense strikes 
On the day of the alleged Kremlin attack, Ukraine said Russia had shelled the southern Kherson region, one strike hitting a supermarket. At least 23 people died, and 46 were wounded in the strikes, officials said. 
After the Kremlin accused Kyiv of attempting to kill Putin, Ukrainian authorities said they faced a new wave of strikes overnight. 
The Ukrainian air force said Thursday that Russia had fired 24 attack drones overnight, 18 of which were downed. Authorities said there were no casualties.
Sergiy Popko, the head of the city of Kyiv’s military administration, said “all enemy missiles and UAVs (unm­anned aerial vehicles) were destroyed over Kyiv by air defence forces”. 
Popko said it was the third day of attempted strikes on Kyiv in May.
“Our city has not experienced such intensity of strikes since the beginning of this year,” he said.
