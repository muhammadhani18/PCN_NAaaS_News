Senior Civil Judge Nasrum Minallah was hearing a petition seeking action against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman for marrying his present wife reportedly during her Iddat period. 
Iddat is a 130-day waiting period, or a period of abstinence, after the dissolution of a woman’s marriage during which she is supposed to remain unmarried. 
Aun Chaudhry, who was once a confidant of the former prime minister and acted as a witness to his third Nikah in 2018, testified before the trial court that Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi tied the knot before the end of the latter’s Iddat. 
Earlier on April 12, Mufti Mohammad Saeed, who solemnised the Nikah, had made a similar testimony before the same court. 
Aun Chaudhry, who is now an adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, stated that he was very close to Mr Khan and looking after his political and personal affairs.  
He said Mr Khan divorced his second wife in 2015 after Bushra Bibi asked him to part ways with Reham for “the sake of a better future”. 
Aun Chaudhry said that Mr Khan acted upon her instruction and divorced Reham at a time when she was abroad and sent her the divorce deed through e-mail. 
According to the statement, Mr Khan suffered mental stress after the divorce. One day, he asked Chaudhry to accompany him to Bushra Bibi’s home. 
“He then asked me to make arrangements for the marriage on Jan 1, 2018. I was surprised to hear this since Bushra Bibi was already a married woman, but Mr Khan assured me that she has been divorced,” said the statement by Aun Chaudhry. 
The witness further testified that he left for Lahore the next day with Mufti Saeed and Zulfi Bukhari, another witness to the Nikah. 
Mr Chaudhry informed the court that when Mufti Saeed  asked Imran Khan about the divorce, the latter said he would show the deed later. 
It was later confirmed that Nikah was performed before the expiry of Iddat period: Feb 17 or 18, said Imran’s former adviser.  
According to Aun Chaudhry, Mr Khan told him the reason for getting married to Bushra Bibi was that she had predicted “I will become the prime minister if I get married on the first day of 2018”. 
The judge adjourned hearing till May 10 after recording Aun Chaudhry’s statement. 
The court is likely to decide the maintainability of the case on the next date of hearing.

1,Dispute between apex lawyers’ bodies lands at SC’s door,"SCBA moves top court against PBC’s show-cause notice, suspends members of executive committee.","ISLAMABAD: The dispute between the top lawyers’ bodies landed at the doorstep of the Supreme Court on Thursday, with the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) challenging the issuance of a show-cause notice and de-seating of its secretary and additional secretary on account of alleged misconduct by the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC).
In a late-night move, the SCBA also suspended the membership of the PBC executive committee members, including its chairman Hassan Raza Pasha, over “gross misconduct” and alleged attempts to take over the Supreme Court lawyers’ body.
Moved through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the petition requested the apex court to quash the notices issued by the PBC and its executive committee to Muqtedir Akhtar Shab­bir and Malik Shakeelur Reh­man over their alleged defiance of the decisions of the executive committee.
The controversy at hand was the Feb 24 meeting of the PBC executive committee which decided that Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon will represent the association instead of its president Abid Zuberi before the Supreme Court in a suo motu case regarding delay in Punjab and KP polls. Subsequently, the PBC on April 4 de-seated the two office bearers over non-compliance with the executive body’s decision. 

SCBA moves top court against PBC’s show-cause notice, suspends members of executive committee

‘Mala fide and without jurisdiction’
The petition pleaded that the notice and the de-seating were “blatantly illegal, arbitrary, mala fide, without jurisdiction, politically motivated, and in violation of the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 9, 10A, 17, 18, 19, 19A and 25, read with Article 4”.
It also challenged Rule 125 and 175-B of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Rules 1976 with a request before the court to declare the same as illegal and liable to be struck down. 
Rule 125 allows the PBC to initiate suo motu proceedings against advocates for disciplinary reasons while Rule 175-B suggests punishment for non-observance or defiance of council’s instructions.
A restraining order has also been sought from the court against the PBC to stop it from interfering in the affairs of the SCBA and taking “adverse or coercive action” against the association on the basis of the show-cause notice. 
The petition alleged that the group having the majority in the PBC was actively working against the rule of law, independence of the bar and judiciary under alleged dictation. 
The petitioners have no faith in the independence of the PBC, it said, adding that Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar was a member of the PBC and was allegedly exerting his influence over the council to further the agenda of his political party.
The petition argued that neither the SCBA nor its members in any way are accountable to the PBC since it was an association of all the Supreme Court-enrolled advocates which serves as an independent and democratic forum ensuring equal and fair representation of all advocates of the Supreme Court.
The petition alleged that the notice was “simply an attempt to curb” the SCBA’s voice and to threaten and harass those attempting to “lay bare the hypocrisy and corruption prevalent in the PBC”.
Memberships suspended 
Meanwhile, in an apparently retaliatory measure, SCBA Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir suspended the membership of seven members of the PBC executive committee, namely Chairman Hassan Raza Pasha, members Syed Amjad Shah, Riazat Ali Sahar, Muhammad Tariq Afridi, Muhammad Masood Chishti, Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon and Syed Qalb-e-Hassan. The issue has also been referred to the general meeting for a final decision.
In an announcement, the SCBA alleged that from the very beginning of the present term of the 25th Executive Committee, the majority group controlling the PBC tried to sabotage the working of the SCBA directly and through their group members within the executive committee. 
The SCBA held that the members conducted the executive committee meeting in a “contemptuous matter which was sub-judice before the Supreme Court, which amounts to the contempt of the Supreme Court and defeats the interest of justice”. 
“These members are attempting to illegally takeover the SCBA by taking illegal action against the secretary and the additional secretary, which amounted to the gross misconduct of the SCBA.” According to the apex body, it conducted an inquiry in which it was established that members committed gross misconduct and illegally attempted to take over the SCBA.

2,Bushra serves legal notice on Maryam Nawaz,"ISLAMABAD: Bushra Bibi, wife of PTI chairman Imran Khan, on Thursday served a legal notice on PML-N leader Maryam...","ISLAMABAD: Bushra Bibi, wife of PTI chairman Imran Khan, on Thursday served a legal notice on PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz Sharif for launching a “vilification and slanderous” campaign against the former first lady. 
She said the PML-N leader should tender an unconditional apology within seven days or be ready to face legal action. 
Bushra Bibi, through her counsel Faisal Fareed, said Ms Sharif’s allegations were aimed at harming, defaming and denigrating her and her family with an intention to benefit Mr Khan’s political opponents. 
The legal notice was issued over a speech made by Maryam Nawaz at Lahore’s Model Town on May 1, which was carried live by television channels. 
The notice reads: “Defamatory, false, frivolous and slanderous accusations were hurled against our client. Through a well thoughtout action, she (Maryam) intentionally accused Bushra Bibi, who is a pious woman  and a housewife, to satisfy ill-will and vindictive agenda. 
“Our client, along with her family, has suffered from immense damage to their reputation of being a law-abiding citizen as well as wife of former prime minister of Pakistan and Maryam was primarily responsible for this untruthful and dishonest defamation campaign against Khan’s wife. 
“Therefore, either she should withdraw her statement and tender unconditional apology to our client, within seven days of issuance of this notice or our client reserves legal right to initiate legal actions under the relevant laws in the courts of competent jurisdiction in case of non-tendering of public apology.”

3,President wants job quota for persons with disabilities implemented,Dr Alvi says country’s 12-14pc population suffers from some form of disability,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Thursday called for implementing the job quota for persons with disabilities (PWDs) in public and private sector and urged banks, chambers of commerce & industries, multi-national firms and trade organisations to employ PWDs to make them financially independent.
The president, in a follow-up meeting at the Presidency on framework for classification of disabilities, said that almost 12 to 14 per cent of the country’s population suffered from some form of disability and the government and private sector should provide them employment for their financial empowerment.
The meeting was attended by senior officials of the Ministry of Human Rights and other government departments concerned.
During the meeting, the president said that disability quota should be implemented as per its actual spirit, adding that chambers of commerce and industries, banks, multi-national corporations, trade bodies, and other private sector organisations should employ differently-abled people (DAPs) as per their skill sets and nature of disabilities.

Dr Alvi says country’s 12-14pc population suffers from some form of disability

He said the country must focus on providing DAPs with skill-based education to help them secure jobs and ensure their inclusion in the mainstream of socio-economic activities.
President Alvi highlighted the need to develop close coordination among relevant stakeholders to impart skills to PWDs as per their special needs as well as market requirements.
He said that training institutes and relevant government organisations should accelerate their efforts to equip PWDs with marketable skills and link them with potential employers in the private sector to provide them suitable jobs in accordance with their skills and quota.
He also stressed the need to provide disability certificates to PWDs in a quick, easy and hassle-free manner to enable them to benefit from different schemes and facilities being offered by the government.
The director general/ Council on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) secretary, Abdul Sattar, informed the meeting that the organisation, in coordination with different federal ministries, was working to ensure implementation of the disability quota.
He apprised the meeting that the disability quota was being observed in the government sector whereas efforts were being made to ensure its greater implementation in the private sector.
The director general said that CRPD was working on a programme to provide skills to PWDs as per their disabilities and the needs of the employers.
Trade with Saudi Arabia
Later in a meeting with Ambassador-designate of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Farooq, President Alvi emphasised the need for robust economic and trade relations with Saudi Arabia for mutual benefit of the two brotherly countries.
The president said Pakistan attached special significance to its relations with Saudi Arabia, which were based on common faith, shared history and people-to-people contacts.
He said that Pakistan wanted to further consolidate the existing bilateral ties into a strategic economic partnership for the mutual interest of the two countries.

4,"After PTI-govt talks, SC to hear poll schedule case today",Coalition govt expected to submit report to apex court on outcome of negotiations.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court will resume hearing the election schedule case today after the government and the main opposition PTI sat together for three days and tried to talk out the issue.
The talks were aimed at developing a consensus on a date for elections in one go across the country. However, after negotiations concluded on Tuesday, the PTI told the court in a report that no solution could be arrived at and asked it to implement its order for holding polls in Punjab on May 14.
In the last hearing on April 27, the three-member Supreme Court bench — headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and also consisting of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar — also made it clear to the negotiating parties that its April 4 order on Punjab Assembly elections had remained unchanged.
Meanwhile, after the PTI submitted its version of negotiations with the coalition government, the federal government is also expected to submit a report to the court on Friday (today) about the talks’ outcome.

Coalition expected to submit report to apex court on outcome of negotiations

On Wednesday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) also asked the Supreme Court to revisit its Punjab polls order, arguing that only the commission had the authority to change the election programme under Section 58 of the Elections Act 2017.
 
 

In the April 27 hearing, the Supreme Court implored the political parties to sit together for the sake of the Constitution and arrive at a consensus date for holding simultaneous elections across the country.
In its order issued after the hearing, the court appreciated the efforts of all parties to try to end the current political impasse and in particular their voluntary agreement to enter into negotiations to choose a single date for elections.
The order mentioned that talks and negotiations between the government and the PTI were entirely to be their own effort without any direction or order from the court in any manner.
During that hearing, the order recalled, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan had briefed the court about the communication between the two sides during the Eid holidays. Mr Awan also contended that the initial steps had been taken to nominate members of both negotiating teams and matters relating to their meeting.
When the court asked why Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani had been involved, PPP’s senior counsel Senator Farooq H. Naek had explained that the Senate was picked as the venue because it had equal representation from the provinces and all political parties were present there. Besides, he said, Mr Sanjrani would only facilitate talks without any substantive involvement.
Meanwhile, after the two sides concluded the talks on Tuesday, the PTI submitted a report to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking it to implement its April 4 order to hold elections in the Punjab Assembly on May 14.
The party said it was ready to accept simultaneous elections with certain conditions, including that the National Assembly and the assemblies of Sindh and Balochistan should also be dissolved on or before May 14 so that nationwide polls could be held in July.
Besides, to give a constitutional cover to holding elections to the Punjab and KP assemblies beyond the period of 90 days, MNAs belonging to PTI would rejoin the National Assembly and a one-time constitutional amendment validating the delay in elections beyond the period of 90 days for Punjab and KP assemblies shall be carried out by mutual consent of the political parties, the PTI had proposed.
Besides, all the parties shall agree that the election results would be accepted as a whole subject to individual grievances in accordance with the law. And an agreement in writing to the above effect shall be submitted before the Supreme Court to ensure that the implementation of the agreement was complied with by the parties in letter and spirit.
However, the PTI said in the report, the government rejected these proposals and instead proposed that the National Assembly and the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies could be dissolved on July 30, after which elections across the country would be held in 90 days, in the first week of October.

5,Afghan FM arrives today for trilateral dialogue,Amir Mu­­ttaqi will also participate in the 5th China-Pakistan-Afghanistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue on May 6.,"ISLAMABAD: Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Mu­­ttaqi will arrive here on Fri­day on a four-day visit to Pakistan.
He will lead a high-level delegation, which includes the Act­ing Minister for Commerce and Industry, Haji Nooruddin Azizi, and senior officials from the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Transport and Trade.
Apart from holding bilateral meetings, the acting Afghan foreign minister will also participate in the fifth China-Pakistan-Afghanistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue on May 6. 
State Councilor and Foreign Minister of China Qin Gang will also arrive here on Friday on a two-day visit to participate in the trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue.
The visit of the acting Afghan foreign minister is a continuation of Pakistan’s political engagement process with Afghanistan which, inter alia, included the visit of Pakistan’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to Kabul on Nov 29 last year and a visit of a high-level delegation, led by the defence minister of Pakistan to Kabul on Feb 22 this year.
During the visit, the two sides will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the political, economic, trade, connectivity, peace and security, and education domains. “Pakistan is desirous of a peaceful, prosperous, stable and connected Afghanistan and reiterates its commitment to pursue continuous and practical engagement with the interim Afghan government,” a statement issued by the Foreign Office said.
Since its launch in 2017, the trilateral dialogue mechanism has achieved remarkable results and has become an important platform for the three countries to enhance understanding and deepen mutual trust and cooperation. 
The dialogue this time is taking place at a time when cross-border attacks from Afghanistan are on the rise and an estimated 150 attacks have been carried out by terrorists in 2022, using the Afghan soil.
In August 2022, US President Joe Biden announced that his forces had killed Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike, which the Taliban interim administration refused to accept openly. 
The Afghan officials alleged that the US had launched the attack using Pakistani airspace, but Islamabad rejected the claim, saying the US was never allowed to use its airspace against Afghanistan.

6,ECP declares Shujaat PML-Q president,Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain’s plea rejected.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday announced its verdict on the presidency of the PML-Q, declaring Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as the party head and rejecting as illegal the amendments introduced to the PML-Q constitution.
After joining hands with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and some of his associates approached the ECP to remove Mr Hussain as the PML-Q President, but the commission rejected the request.
In February, former chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi formally joined the PTI, along with 10 former party lawmakers. 
Mr Elahi made the announcement at a press conference along with PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry. 

Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain’s plea rejected

In January, the ECP restored Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as the president of the PML-Q on his petition amid an ongoing tussle with his cousin Chaudhry Parvez Elahi over the position.
The commission declared the dismissal of Mr Hussain contradictory to the party’s constitution. The ECP’s judgment was challenged in the Lahore High Court, which remanded the case back to ECP, with directions that documents submitted by Chaudhry Wajahat with it be examined in accordance with the law.
The ECP, in its detailed order, said it received Authority letter dated 26.01.2023, signed by Chau­dhry Wajahat Hussain, acting as PML President and authorising Mr Asim Cheema to sign Form-65 (int­ra-party elections allegedly held on 26.01.2023) and another Auth­ority letter submitting an amendment made to PML constitution.
It said that both documents were received prior to the decision dated 31.01.2023, in the matter of Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who had invoked the jurisdiction of the Commission under Section 8 read with Section 208(4), further read with Rule 197, of the Elections Act, 2017, and Election Rules, 2017, by impugning the proceedings of the CEC initiated for his removal from the position of party head.
It said that the letter signed by Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain, acting as the PML-Q President and authorising Mr Asim Cheema to sign Form-65 (intra-party elections) was not in accordance with relevant provisions of the Elections Act, 2017, as well as the constitution of the PML-Q.
The letter in question when perused on touchstone of section 209 (3), makes it abundantly clear that only those certificates which are in accordance with sections 208 & 209, are required to be published in the official Gazette as stipulated in Rule 158(2) which provides that the “Commission shall, after satisfying itself that the certificate fulfills the requirements of sections 208 and 209, publish the certificate including the details of election in the official Gazette”.
As per record, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain was/is the validly elected President of the PML-Q and only he was empowered in terms of section 209(1) to authorise an office-bearer to submit certificate (Form-65) in the Commission.
It said the other authority letter in question whereby certain amendments to PML-Q constitution, allegedly made by PML-Q Council and conveyed to the Commission, had no valid authorisation of the party. 
“Since the status of Ch. Wajahat Hussain was of a stranger and not party head of the PML, the documents submitted on his behalf were liable to rejection instead of return,” it said.
There is another aspect of this case based on an Affidavit of Mr Muhammad Ishtiaq Gohar, who was nominated by the petitioner as Chairman of Provincial Election Commission, Punjab, to conduct intra-party elections on 26.01.2023, who in his affidavit stated on oath that election schedule and other resolutions for conduct of intra-party elections on 26.01.2023, were all prepared by some other person and were fake and he had been asked to declare Mr Elahi as un-opposed President of PML-Q.
He in his affidavit further mentioned that the result of intra-party elections submitted in the ECP were not declared by him nor signed by him as chairman of the Provincial Election Commission and his signatures were forged. 
“Therefore, the amendment in PML constitution was not required to be maintained in record in terms of section 201(3) of the Act. With the above observations, the matter stands disposed of,” the ECP order said.
