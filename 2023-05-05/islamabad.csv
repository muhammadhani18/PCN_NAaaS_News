0,Assessment of capital’s future water requirements underway,"No immediate plan to construct new dam, minister tells National Assembly","ISLAMABAD: The growing scarcity of water in Islamabad echoed in the National Assembly on Thursday. The lawmakers were told that a detailed assessment was underway on the future requirements of water in the city which has seen a rapid growth in its population with no new water project for almost three decades.
In response to a question asked by MNA Shamim Ara, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbasi said Islamabad has been facing an increase in its population but there was no immediate plan for construction of a new dam for the capital. However, he said a detailed assessment of the future requirement of potable water in the city was underway.
The minister said after completion of the assessment, decisions will be taken about new resources, adding there was a proposal for the uprising of Simly Dam as well.
Meanwhile, in a written reply, the house was told that Simly Dam located at 35 km northeast of Islamabad was owned by the Capital Development Authority. It said that  1,700 major/minor leakages had been rectified by replacing the affected distribution lines during the last two years. This helped save 8-10 MGD water.

No immediate plan to construct new dam, minister tells National Assembly

Challans for wastage of water such as overflowing from underground/overhead tanks, washing of cars, porches and driveways were also being served on a daily basis.
It may be noted here that no new source of potable water has been explored for the last almost three decades even though the population of Islamabad has seen fast growth due to urbanisation and migration of people from other parts of the country.
However, the CDA has been focusing on the construction of roads as currently over Rs50 billion projects are being executed in the capital. 
Similarly, the CDA has also launching new housing schemes, including development of new sectors.
In addition, the business of private housing schemes, including apartment projects, is also thriving in Islamabad, but the sources of water remained the same as they were in the 1990s.
Though several announcements were made in the past to start projects such as construction of the proposed Chirrah, Shahdara, Chinyot dams, extension of Khanpur Dam and above all the Ghazi Barotha project to bring water from Indus River, the CDA and successive governments could not translate the announcements into reality.
CDA officials say the last water project - Khanpur Dam - was launched in the ‘90s. At that time, the population of the city was around 600,000 which in the census 2017 was recorded at 2.2 million. Now it is believed to be around three million. 
The officials said in summers the residents face water shortage and if steps were not taken in coming years, the city could face a major crisis-like situation.
CDA’s own documents showed that the water demand in 2020 was about 215 million gallon per day (mgd) and projected to be about 278 mgd in 2030 and 411 mgd in 2040. Currently, the CDA has three main sources - Simly Dam, Khanpur Dam and tubewells - and all these sources are providing around 70 mgd, which is far less than the requirement.
Earlier, during the question hour session, the lawmakers also took up the issue of encroachment in Islamabad’s markets and deputationist officers who have been joining the CDA for the last eight years.
The lawmakers pleaded that vacant seats in CDA should be filled thorough new recruitment and Mr Abbasi told the house that efforts were being made to get approval from the government for starting recruitment in CDA.

1,NA body passes security sciences varsity bill despite HEC’s opposition,The proposed National University of Security Sciences will be set up in Islamabad.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on Federal Education and Professional Training on Thursday approved a bill for the establishment of a private university despite opposition from the Higher Education Commission (HEC).
The committee met with MNA Makhdoom Syed Samiul Hassan Gillani in the chair and took up the bill moved by Dr Nisar Ahmed Cheema.
The proposed National University of Security Sciences will be set up in Islamabad.  The HEC in its working paper had informed the committee that there were deficiencies in the paper work of the proposed university; therefore, the bill should not be passed for the time being.  However, the committee passed the bill conditionally.
“Upon consideration of the National University of Security Sciences Islamabad Bill 2022 (moved by Dr Nisar Ahmed Cheema, MNA), the committee was informed by the HEC that certain prerequisites were yet to be met by the management of the proposed university. Therefore, the bill may be pended till completion of the said codal formalities,” read a statement issued by National Assembly Secretariat after the committee meeting.
It said the ministry pleaded that withholding of the bill was not advisable as a considerable span of time had already elapsed. The committee after due discussion recommended that the bill, as introduced, may be passed by the National Assembly. The management of the university was however directed that the university could only start functioning on completion of all the codal formalities and their subsequent concurrence by the HEC.
Family life and wedlock bill
On presentation of the “Protection of Family Life and Wedlock Bill 2023”, the mover (Javairia Zafar Aheer, MNA) informed the committee that Article 25, 34 and 35 of the constitution provided for protection of family and full participation of women in national life. Therefore, the committee may pass the bill.
The education ministry stated that since the proposed legislation pertained to absorption of hundreds of teachers working under the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE); therefore, it would be appropriate if views from the Establishment Division, Finance Division and Ministry of Law and Justice were obtained before its passage.
Endorsing the suggestion, the committee deferred consideration on the bill and appointed an inter-departmental committee, comprising the secretary Ministry of Federal Education (as chairman) and representatives from to Establishment Division, Finance Division, Ministry of Law and Justice and FDE (officers not below the rank of BS-20) as members to look into the pros and cons of the bill, review the wedlock policy and submit a report to the committee in 15 days.

The Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE) is conducting the matric exams. On Thursday, nine graders appeared in the paper of Islamiat.  The students and teachers alike stated that it was out of course.
Later, principals of the schools approached FDE and submitted their concerns.  Subsequently, the FDE took up the issue with FBISE.  The FDE’s deputy director academic through an official letter informed the FBISE about the “out of course paper” and requested the board to look into the matter and resolve the issue at the earliest keeping in view the interest of the students.
To this, FBISE Chairman Qaiser Alam formed a four-member committee. The committee will assess the questions framed in the paper and alignment of these questions with the syllabus, prescribed book and curriculum. It will also check the contents of the textbook being taught in the FDE institutions.
The board’s letter further said more than 137000 candidates appeared in Islamiat Compulsory-I paper out of whom 112463 opted the old syllabus paper (without any problem) and 24857 the new syllabus.

3,PMDC offers ‘golden handshake’ to permanent staffers,"Employees entitled to double commutation package, 12-month leave encashment among other perks.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) offered a voluntary ‘golden handshake’ (GHS) to about 100 permanent employees in line with the PMDC Act 2022 as the government attempts to reduce pension-related expenses.
A senior officer of the council said in light of the PMDC Act, the government adopted a policy to reduce the pension expenditure by offering employees less than 55 years old a severance package in return for their early retirement.
In the exercise of the power conferred by Section 9 of the PMDC Act 2022, the competent authority has been pleased to announce the GHS to its regular employees having less than 55 years of age and service of 10 years or more as of June 30, 2023.

Employees entitled to double commutation package, 12-month leave encashment among other perks

It stated that the employees who will accept the GHS will get double commutation of their pension as a part of the final settlement. However, they will not be paid pensions on a monthly basis. 
Moreover, the employees will be entitled to get leave encashment of 12 months and a payment equivalent to a one-year salary will be paid as the PMDC welfare grant. 
The general provident fund will be self-subscription plus PMDC contribution and interest after adjustment of the outstanding advance amount.
A senior officer of PMDC, wishing not to be quoted, said that it was the requirement of the PMDC Act to offer GHS to the employees. “In the past Pakistan Medical Commission announced compulsory GHS for the employees and give a nominal amount of Rs2.6 million to those who were in a special pay scale,” he said.
“However the current GHS is voluntary. Employees, on average, may get Rs10 million but, as the age limit has been reduced to 55 years, a majority of employees may not accept it,” he said.
It is worth mentioning that in January this year, the PMC finally ceased to exist after President Dr Arif Alvi okayed the PMDC Bill 2022, making it an Act of Parliament. In December last year, parliament passed the PMDC bill in a joint sitting and sent it to President Alvi to get his nod.
It is worth mentioning that earlier on April 11, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had appointed eight members of the PMDC to complete the 15-member body of the council. According to the notification issued at the time, the five members were nominated under the category of medical practitioners, namely Prof Amjad Siraj Memon, Prof Rizwan Taj, Muhammad Zubair Khan, Dr Mahmud Aurangzeb, and Prof Dr Tehmina Asad. Jawad Amin Khan was appointed in the category of philanthropist, while Chaudhry Sultan Mansoor and Noorul Haque were appointed in the legal and chartered accountant categories, respectively.
The remaining seven commission members include the surgeon general, NHS secretary, health secretaries of the four provinces and one member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan. Later Rizwan Taj, a psychiatrist by profession, had become president of the PMDC.

4,"Manpower, resources required to reduce traffic congestion: minister","ISLAMABAD: Immediate enhancement of manpower and resources is required, besides, construction of the already ...","ISLAMABAD: Immediate enhancement of manpower and resources is required, besides, construction of the already approved Ring Road project to reduce traffic problems and congestion in the capital.
Details provided by Interior Minister Rana Sanullah Khan in response to questions asked by Member of National Assembly (MNA) Syed Imran Ahmed Shah stated that immediate enhancement of manpower and resources is required, for which a case for the creation of 2,616 new posts was already under process in the Establishment Division. 
However, the case has not materialised so far, it added.
The creation of new posts in Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) and their subsequent deployment as per the proposed plan would definitely resolve the issue of traffic congestion in the capital, and better traffic management would be done, according to details added.
The existing strength of the ITP was sanctioned in 2005, and the area of the capital was expanded up to Margalla Hills, Rawat, and Satra Meel, due to which various points are not covered as the government has not sanctioned new posts for the ITP. 
During 2007 to 2022, the population of Islamabad increased from 7,25,000 to 2,001,579 as well as the vehicular population from 169,788 to 1,411,170 as registered by the Excise and Taxation Office Islamabad, apart from the daily entry of vehicles from neighbouring cities, including Rawalpindi, Attock, Jhelum, and Murree, while the resources of the ITP were reduced as compared to 2005.
The ITP fleet comprises 205 vehicles: 25 cars, 26 pickups, four trucks, seven forklifts, a recovery van, and 139 motorcycles and three other vehicles.
ITP is striving hard towards maintaining smooth flow of traffic and to facilitate road commuters in Islamabad with its meagre resources, it said, adding that special deployment has been made during rush hours like school/college and office timings.
No major traffic congestion has been observed on roads of Islamabad during the last year; however, minor traffic overcrowding was faced due to the construction of I.J.P. Road from Faizabad to Mehrabad Flyover, 10th Avenue from Katarian Bridge to Srinagar Highway, Rawal Dam Flyover, Chand Tara Flyover, Islamabad Expressway from Gulberg to Rawat Cross, and Bhara Kahu Bypass.
Corrective measures have been taken through the installation of heavy traffic signs on both sides of Islamabad Expressway and I.J.P. Road to use the extremely left lane and making improvement in road engineering, like the installation of plastic barriers and traffic delineators at Khayaban Chowk, Faisal Avenue u-turn, Srinagar Highway u-turns, Kalsoom Plaza, Express Chowk, Ayub Chowk, F-8 Exchange, and Pims u-turn.
It has also been improved through the enhancement of deployment and the establishment of a traffic congestion response unit with the aim of maintaining smooth flow of traffic. The composition of the traffic congestion response unit consists of five vehicles, including four motorcycles, with real-time monitoring through Safe City cameras.
In order to maintain a smooth flow of traffic, extra strength has been deployed at the construction area mentioned above within the available resources.

Mr Yaqoob in a press release said the committee would work on a daily basis to accomplish the assigned task within the stipulated period.
The committee would present its recommendations to the government after identifying the officers involved in the 491 against merit appointments through a fake and fictitious process and fixing responsibilities for the abuse of authority, he said, adding it would also propose disciplinary action against the culpable officers and officials to the government.

At a ceremony held at the district police lines on Thursday, district Police officer (DPO) Dr Sardar Ghiyas Gul Khan along with SP investigation Jawaria Mohammad Jameel pinned new ranks to the officials.
Seven assistant sub-inspectors (ASI) were promoted to sub-inspectors (SI), 14 head constables to assistant sub-inspectors and five constables to head constables.
Speaking on this occasion, the DPO urged the officials to restore the grace of their uniform by dint of their conduct.

He appreciated the hard work of the policemen and said that each member of the force was a hero as they served the people despite various odds. The policemen have to perform duties in tough weather conditions and remain away from their home which is really appreciable.
Mr Khan said that departmental promotion as well as increase in rank actually led to an increase in responsibilities of police officials. 
“So, you should all perform your responsibilities and duties associated with the new assignment with more diligence, dedication and commitment,” he added.
He hoped for their better output in future and urged them to work hard for protection of the lives and property of the masses by upholding merit and transparency in their professional work, especially investigation.

7,CDA chairman claims ‘poor compaction work’ damaged Margalla Avenue,ISLAMABAD: Capital Development Authority Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal on Thursday informed a parliamentary body that...,"ISLAMABAD: Capital Development Authority Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal on Thursday informed a parliamentary body that cracks in newly-constructed Margalla Avenue developed due to poor compaction work.
“Work on 30 meters to 40 meters patch of the road where cracks have developed was rushed as contractors had roughly three to four days to wrap up work on this stretch, near Shah Allah Dita, after locals threatened to hinder the development work,” Noorul Amin Mengal claimed in a briefing to the Public Accounts Committee.
PAC had summoned the CDA chairman on short notice seeking an explanation after cracks developed on Margalla Avenue before the formal inauguration of the road which connects D-12 with GT Road. In response to an observation from the committee, Noorul Amin Mengal said that a third party validation would be conducted by Nespak to ensure the quality of Margalla Avenue.
The road stretched from the GT Road to D-12 and had been opened for traffic before its formal inauguration as some work, including a 700-metre portion, was still pending.
Earlier, PAC chief Noor Alam Khan observed that cracks that had developed on both sides of the road near the Shah Allah Ditta underpass raised questions about the quality of the construction work. In response to directions from Noor Alam Khan to repair the patch, Chairman CDA, responded the repair works had already started.
Encroachment on footpaths
The PAC members also expressed displeasure over encroachments on footpaths, infringing access of pedestrians. “Start anti-encroachment drives in Kohsar, and other posh markets in F-6 and F-7, where restaurant owners have spread outdoor seating onto footpaths infringing the right of way of pedestrians,” said Noor Alam Khan.
“Restaurant owners should not be allowed to place chairs outdoors before 8pm or 10pm,” Noor Alam Khan suggested. Mr Mengal responded that encroachments had been removed from sidewalks in F-7, F-6 and F-10 Markaz.
In response to another question from a member on failure to deliver on Park Enclave, Noorul Amin Mengal said that in the past CDA priorities included mega projects worth Rs90 billion such as Margalla Avenue, Bhara Kahu by-pass, 7th Avenue, 11th Avenue, Islamabad Expressway, and Rawal dam flyover.
“Development of sectors was not given priority,” he said.
During the meeting, Noorul Amin also apprised lawmakers about the ‘aggressive anti-encroachment drive’ launched by the civic body. “In a few days, the CDA was able to get 1, 600 units vacated by land mafia in sectors C-13, C-14 and C-15 in one of its kind operations. Similarly, some 200 units were demolished in Park Enclave and nearly 50 individuals were arrested and sent to Adiala Jail after due process,” he informed the meeting.
The PAC also asked for a complete list of plots allotted, within the jurisdiction of the civic authority, to presidents, premiers, lawmakers, federal ministers, cabinet members, judges, generals, and bureaucrats.

The activity was a peace building activity organised by Asma Bashir Kundi as a member of the PeaceFlix initiative by Global Neighbourhood for Media Innovation (GNMI). The programme was designed to promote peace, inclusivity and social cohesion in localcapacities. 
The programme’s core objective was to create discoursearound women’s role in peace building in Pakistan and the world. In the first phase of this project, female journalists nationwide, who covered war, conflict and violence in the field of journalism, shared stories they covered with art students. 
Art students were selected from various art institutes including Fatima Jinnah Women University, Quaid-i-Azam University and IMCG Korang Town. The students then painted shared stories on canvas.
As many as 17 students participated in this initiative and produced 16 paintings and a 3-D project to represent the stories highlighting the need and ways for peace in society.
Director general of PNCA Ayoub Jamali said that the basis of peace was trust. The foundation of trust was transparency, and the base of transparency was shared inner experience. Art was a powerful tool for expressing inner expertise to build trust and peace.
He added that the PNCA had supported promotion of exhibits and the best modern and contemporary art on a national and international scale.
The PNCA was set up to spearhead the development of skills in Pakistan. The council aims to build an environment conducive to flourishing of the arts, where the arts were accessible to everyone and artists and art groups have the commitment,support and resources to excel at home and on the world stage.
A painting by Roshan Bakht, with the title, Carving Fate, was getting visitors’ attention. This painting represented a story of a street boy named Noman Khan from Peshawar, who worked as a servant while he joined a free art academy and successfully created his art career. 
Khan changed his fate through hard work and exhibited his paintings at the age of 16. This story was done by journalist from Peshawar, Fatima Nazish. Bakht said: “Through this opportunity, I learned a lot about painting techniques. As an artist, I believe it becomes my primary duty to promote peace through my artwork. The storyline was fascinating as it depicts the harsh reality of struggling young artists. Still, it ends on a beautiful, successful path.”
Sadaf Hammad, assistant professor at Islamabad Model College for Girls Korang Town, said: “This exhibition is the first of its kind. The idea is unique, and it engages students to create interesting artwork based on case studies provided by women journalists. The stories are the outcome of their commitment to their field. The diverse experience shared by different journalists seems amazing as artwork.”
Asma Bashir Kundi, organiser of the workshop on behalf of PeaceFlix, thanked the participantsand said that all the students worked with passion, and the outcome was great.
The founder of Women Journalists Association of Pakistan, Fouzia Kulsoom Rana, said that the idea by peace-builder Asma Kundi to present the stories of women journalists on canvas with vibrant colours was unique, and it was not an easy goal to implement. 
The Women Journalists Association of Pakistan, expressed gratitude to PNCA and the continuous support of Team GNMI to make the activity possible.

Overloading, misbehaving with passengers, wrong parking and other violations of traffic rules are common among public transporters, while the traffic police seem to behave politely with them while they are violating traffic rules.
The decision to launch a joint crackdown against public service vehicles regarding route permit, fitness certificate, without number plate and other violations of traffic laws was taken during a meeting held between Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Taimoor Khan and RTA Secretary Mohammad Rashid Ali on Thursday.
The two heads of their respective departments reached an agreement stating that any complaints from passengers about public transporters would result in stern action being taken against them.
A traffic police spokesman said that Mr Khan held a meeting with Mr Ali in his office regarding provision of better facilities to passengers travelling in public service transport.
In order to ensure the convenience and safety of travel, full cooperation was assured by providing traffic police personnel for joint operation regarding violation of route permit, travelling without fitness certificate, without number plate and other violations of traffic rules.
The CTO instructed the RTA secretary to ensure the presence of motor vehicle examiner during the commercial driving test in any case so that citizens who are coming to obtain licences do not face any problem.
He said that all available resources will be used to solve the problems of passengers travelling in public service vehicles to make their journey calm and their lives safe.
Meanwhile, City Traffic Police started crackdown against violation of one-way and issued challans to 60 vehicle owners, and shifted seven vehicles to police stations.
Following the orders of the CTO, in-charge of Traffic Civil Line Circle Aamir Mushtaq started action against one-way violation.
Challan tickets were issued to 60 motorcycle owners and vehicles for violating one-way during checking at places, while seven were locked up in the police station for not being able to present documents.
The CTO said that violation of one-way on highways not only causes accidents but sometimes also causes traffic jams so zero tolerance orders have been issued against violators and along with issuing challans, their licences will also be suspended.
He also issued orders to all circle and sector in-charges to depute additional wardens at one-way places, who will take strict and indiscriminate action against those violating the one-way.
