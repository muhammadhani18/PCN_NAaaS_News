0,Roundtable calls for encouraging women in politics,Session discussed challenges faced by women seeking participation in policy-making,"A roundtable consultative dialogue titled 'Women's Road to Parliament' organised by Karachi German consulate and a marketing company New World Concepts (NWC), was held on Tuesday, featuring women leaders from the corporate and business sector, media, and academia, among others. 
Present at the occasion, German Consul General Dr Rudiger Lotz emphasised the importance of significantly increasing the proportion of women in political life to consider the interests of all people, both men and women, in decision-making processes. 
The session discussed and explored challenges facing women leaders seeking greater participation in public policy-making, aiming to encourage positive change in difficult times and empower the next generation of women. 
A member of the German Parliament and South Asia Parliamentary Group Chair, Renate Kunast, delivered a virtual address and emphasised the need for greater participation of women in all levels of public policy. 
She shared examples from Germany and the European Union (EU), highlighting the role of women leaders from diverse sectors in the country's decision-making. 
""Women are treated as properties, regardless of their success, and this feeling is perpetuated by their husbands, fathers, and sons,"" a participant remarked. 
She questioned the frequency of legislative actions by women for women in parliament, pointing out that political parties seemingly do not prioritise it. 
Anchorperson Sidra Iqbal said that women feel frustrated and thanked social media for providing them space to express their sentiments. She emphasised that women face two choices when considering a decision; whether the matter at hand or what others will think about it. 
In Chitral, she mentioned that 57 per cent of voters were women, making them kingmakers. She criticized TV commercials for portraying women as happy tractor drivers while, in reality, women are engaged in both unpaid and paid work. 
Another speaker advocated for more female ministers, especially in areas where policymakers need to understand women's vulnerability. 
She praised the State Bank of Pakistan and Pakistan First Lady Samina Alvi for initiatives supporting financial inclusion but lamented the lack of ramps and Braille for disabled persons at many banks, emphasising the need for disability inclusion. 
Nargis Soorti from the Soorti Foundation highlighted the lack of dedicated toilets for women in public and workspaces.

1,Limited trauma facilities plague public hospitals,The total number of beds across all accident departments of government hospitals would be 300 only,"Accident victims requiring immediate first aid for their injuries hope to receive urgent medical attention from whichever hospital they are able to reach in time yet for trauma patients in the port city, seeking medical help in the absence of adequate surgical emergency facilities, getting even a simple dressing for a wound might require hours of waiting and searching.
Rameez, and his wife, shared their struggle to receive timely medical care after they were injured during a road accident in Nazimabad.
“When we reached the emergency department at the Abbassi Shaheed Hospital, there weren’t enough treatment resources available therefore, we had to go to the Jinnah Hospital. Although the Jinnah Hospital was able to treat my minor wounds, my wife’s head injuries could not be treated properly and we eventually had to rush to a private clinic,” recalled Rameez.
Another youth Raheel was also injured during a road accident and had to receive first aid care at a private hospital. “Even though, I was lucky enough to receive proper treatment at a private facility, I feel for the poor patients, who would be unable to bear such high medical expenses,” said Raheel.
According to Dr Faisal Sultan, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital, various challenges are facing public health facilities across the province. “There is a dire need for reforming and upgrading the public health sector. The trauma and accident departments of Karachi’s major government hospitals are not only inadequate in proportion to the increasing population, but the facilities available there are also not in line with modern standards,” highlighted Dr Sultan.
On a similar note, Dr Pir Ghulam Nabi Jilani, a public health expert, alluded to the fact that the majority of government hospitals in Karachi were not equipped to handle casualties after emergency situations like terrorist bombings, natural disasters and road accidents.
“The total number of beds across all accident departments of government hospitals would be 300 only, which is very low. Moreover, the on-duty doctors and paramedical staff are also not trained to deal with different kinds of accidental emergencies,” informed Dr Jilani, who further implored that there should be an emergency relief system at the government level, in which the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, rescue and relief institutions and local bodies work together in preparation for any emergency situation.
“Basic health centers should also be introduced at the union council level in Karachi so that the burden of patients on the big hospitals could be reduced,” added Dr Abdul Bari Khan, a public health expert and Head of the Indus Hospital.
“Our hospital receives 1000 patients in the emergency department every day,” claimed Dr Sabir Memon, Head of the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre Karachi.
Dr Qaiser Sajjad, former Secretary of the Pakistan Medical Association, felt that it was a sad reality that government hospitals in the city did not have large-scale treatment facilities to deal with the growing number of accidental emergency cases. “The need of the hour is to set up new government hospitals in view of the rapid growth of Karachi’s population. There should be a 500-bed trauma hospital in every district, so that emergency situations can be seamlessly managed,” directed Dr Sajjad.
Dr Khalid Bukhari, Dr Faisal and Dr Nausheen, the respective representatives of the Civil Hospital, Abbassi Shaheed Hospital and Jinnah Hospital assured that steps were being taken for the expansion of their accident departments.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, the spokesman of the Sindh Health Department said, “We are making efforts to update the trauma facilities in government hospitals across the province, including Karachi.”

2,Fishing boat capsizes in sea; crew rescued,Captain blamed for ignoring weather warning,"As many as 45 fishermen were rescued while drowning after their boat capsized near Hajamro Creek on the night between Monday and Tuesday, bringing relief to their families and communities.
The fishermen hailed from Ibrahim Haidari, Chauhar Jamali, and Juma Goth and were trapped in the unforgiving sea due to strong winds and high waves while fishing in the open waters.
The ill-fated boat, named Al Asad Ali, had departed Ibrahim Haidari, however, the hopes of the fishermen to return with a big catch of fish used in poultry feed, were dashed when they ran into gusts blowing at over 50km per hour.
Ultimately, the boat capsized in the Hijamro Creek, situated between Thatta and Badin, sending the 45 seaworthy fishermen fighting for their lives against wind and tide.
Initially, fellow fishermen attempted to rescue those in distress, followed by coordinated efforts from the Maritime Security Agency, Pakistan Navy, and Fishermen's Cooperative Society. These efforts led to the successful rescue of 43 fishermen, while two remained missing, prompting continued search operations. They were fished out by another launch and dropped at jetty on Thatta coast.

Nasir Boneri, the security in-charge of Fishermen's Cooperative Society, revealed that news of the boat's capsizing reached authorities at around 2:30am on Tuesday, triggering immediate response. 
Boneri attributed the incident not only to the strong winds but also to the captain's decision-making. Most of the fishermen hailed from Ibrahim Haidari, with four from Chauhar Jamali and ten from Juma Goth.
According to Kamal Shah, spokesperson for the Coastal Media Centre, the boat sinking occurred approximately four hours away from Karachi. 
On Tuesday, 28 survivors came back to the fishing village.
