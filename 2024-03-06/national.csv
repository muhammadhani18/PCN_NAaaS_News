0,Privatise government departments: experts,"Believe move will address energy, economic challenges","Leading international and local experts in the energy, power, infrastructure, risk management, and insurance sectors have urged for the promotion and assurance of privatising all government departments to address both the energy and economic challenges of the country.
They said this during presentations at a conference titled: “Energy Summit ‘24,” focused on fostering growth, collaboration, and resilience in Pakistan’s energy mix. The event, held at a local hotel in Karachi on Tuesday, was hosted by Fidelity Insurance Brokers/Lockton.
They also stressed the need for rightsizing staff in government departments and privatising them to tackle energy challenges effectively.
For the past 20 years, Pakistan has consistently ranked among the top 10 most vulnerable countries on the Global Climate Risk Index. Floods have severely compounded the economic challenges of the country, inflicting a severe exogenous shock. The World Bank has estimated Pakistan's flood losses at $30 billion.

Speaking about proposed solutions to the energy crisis, Lucky Electric Power Company Limited, CEO, Ruhail Muhammad said resolving the power sector issues will require significant time and political will. The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has analysed the situation and presented recommendations that can be implemented in the short to medium term to improve the current situation. Muhammad stressed the need for reducing transmission and distribution (T&D) losses to 15% and improving recovery targets to 93%, which would translate into Rs175 billion in annual savings. Lowering tariffs in winter months to optimise capacity usage could potentially increase power revenue by approximately Rs17.5 billion for every 1,000MW incremental demand.
He also highlighted the importance of increasing reliance on local Thar coal to reduce the outflow of valuable foreign exchange. Although he acknowledged the substantial initial investment required to convert power plants to 100% local coal, he highlighted the long-term sustainable benefits.
Discussing the insurance sector’s role in addressing climate change, Zurich Insurance Co Chief Underwriting Officer Pavel Chernoverkhskiy said the insurance sector has a vital role in sharing expertise and coordinating efforts between stakeholders. He proposed a data-led approach to increase resilience across an organisation’s value chain. Chernoverkhskiy noted that insurers can build recovery coalitions among policyholders, authorities, and communities with networks cultivated over decades.
Fidelity Insurance Brokers CEO Khurram Ali Khan underscored the significance of insurance in driving investments, stating, “Insurance is the backbone of the economy.” He urged all stakeholders and energy users to play a role in overcoming the energy crisis.
Thar Coal: Pakistan's 6th largest coal reserves, over 9,000 kilometers, hold around 175 billion tonnes of lignite coal, crucial for energy security. Thermal: Declining natural gas reserves reduce its dominance, while nuclear energy grows. LNG imports tackle gas shortages. Renewables: Solar and wind see increased investments, shifting towards sustainable energy.

1,"Bitcoin strikes record high above $69,000",Approval from US securities regulators enables wider public to invest without holding it directly,"Bitcoin hit a record high above $69,000 on Tuesday, buoyed by the world’s biggest cryptocurrency becoming more accessible for trading amid tightening supplies.
Bitcoin reached $69,191.94, beating a record $68,991 struck in November 2021.
The volatile asset later retreated to $67,442. Bitcoin has enjoyed an unbridled rise since the approval of a new type of investment indexed to the cryptocurrency.
Since their approval on January 10 by US securities regulators, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) indexed to bitcoin have theoretically enabled a wider public to invest in the cryptocurrency without having to hold it directly.
The funds themselves, however, do invest in the digital currency.

The expected approval of the new investment product had contributed in recent months to a rise in its price, which had slumped throughout most of 2022 following the bankruptcy of several crypto giants.
The industry sees the entrance of ETFs on the US market as proof of the growing interest from institutional investors in cryptocurrencies, further boosting enthusiasm for bitcoin.
The digital unit is created -- or “mined” -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems to validate transactions made on the blockchain.
Another forthcoming event is also supporting bitcoin prices.“Halving” is a technical phenomenon in which the reward given to bitcoin “miners” -- those who contribute to the creation of the blockchain by validating transactions -- is divided in two. The event takes place every 210,000 blocks, or groups of transactions verified and incorporated on the blockchain, which corresponds to about every four years. The next halving is set for April.

2,Eurobonds skyrocket on IMF talks,"Investor confidence peaks as new govt seeks financial, economic reforms","Pakistan’s US dollar-denominated Eurobonds hit a record high price in the global market following an informal invitation from the newly elected government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for talks on the last loan tranche of $1.1 billion and a new loan programme.
The development spurred global investors, encouraging them to take new positions in rising foreign bonds on the belief that the nation would successfully meet all future foreign debt repayments, including the $1 billion Eurobond maturing in April 2024.
According to JS Global Research, the 2024 Eurobond reached a new record high price of 99.36 cents each, followed by the 2025 notes soaring to a record high of 90.06 cents each.
The bonds had previously dropped by around 5% due to inconclusive general election results held on February 8 in the country. Prior to securing the current $3 billion loan programme ending in March-April 2024, they were trading at less than 50 cents.


The research house reported that Pakistani foreign bonds, along with others, surged by up to 7% in the week ending Tuesday, marking an outstanding rally amid the formation of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government in the centre.
A total of eight Pakistani Eurobonds and Sukuk are listed in global debt markets, totalling $7.80 billion. They are set to mature between April 2024 and April 2051.
Data further suggests that the bonds have gained value by up to 10% in the span of a month and by up to 17% in the first two months and one week of 2024.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Tahir Abbas, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited, stated that PM Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to initiate talks for a new IMF loan programme has boosted global investor confidence in Pakistan’s economy, attracting them to purchase new lots of the country’s global bonds.
In his inaugural speech after assuming the post of PM on Sunday, Sharif stressed the urgent need for a new loan programme, stating that the government is prepared to take tough decisions in this regard.
Investors took new positions in foreign Eurobonds based on the belief that the nation has a solid plan to repay existing debt. The new package would also provide time for the government to implement necessary economic reforms and boost economic activities and growth.
Abbas noted that the bonds continued to gain traction with political clarity in the country, attracting extended buying since the PML-N and Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) formed a coalition government in the centre.
Subsequently, the election for the national assembly’s speaker and deputy speaker, along with the poll for the prime minister’s post, paved the way for the coalition government to make tough economic decisions to navigate the economy out of crisis.
Abbas projected that the size of the IMF’s new loan programme may vary between $5-8 billion and could span a period of two to three years.
He added that the caretaker government had made significant improvements in economic indicators such as inflation and the current account deficit, which could facilitate Pakistan in securing the new loan package on favourable terms.
Earlier in late January 2024, State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Governor, Jameel Ahmad, remarked that economic indicators had improved significantly, providing a conducive environment for negotiating a new loan programme with the IMF.
The upcoming political government is expected to secure a new programme as the current $3 billion program is set to conclude in March 2024.
Ahmad noted that foreign exchange reserves had increased to $8.3 billion in January from $4 billion six to seven months earlier in June 2023. The current account deficit remained low at 0.7% of GDP (or $800 million), compared to significantly higher levels last year. The inflation rate is expected to sharply decrease in the second half (Jan-Jun) of the current fiscal year 2023-24. The current account deficit is estimated to remain contained at 0.5-1.5% of GDP in FY24. Export earnings and workers’ remittances are on the rise, and the primary fiscal deficit is improving.
Abbas further stated that the new IMF loan programme would create fiscal space for the government to ramp up economic activities.
The new programme may require the government to take measures to increase the number of taxpayers, enhance revenue collection through taxes, sell off loss-making state-owned entities, and initiate reforms in the energy sector to make power and gas affordable for households and businesses.

3,Rupee remains within 279-280/$ band,"In the open market, the currency remained stable at Rs282.05/$ for the second consecutive day","Pakistani currency continued to depreciate for the third consecutive working day on Tuesday as it reached Rs279.31 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee trimmed 0.02% of its value, or Rs0.05, against the greenback on a day-on-day basis.
Market talk suggests that exporters were charging a higher premium on US dollar sales on futures counters, which put the rupee under little bit of pressure. Otherwise, there was ample supply of foreign currency in the domestic market.
More importantly, the rupee has regained 10%, or Rs28, in the past five and a half months, hitting over four-month high at Rs279.11/$ late last week compared to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ touched in the first week of September 2023.
Read: PSX slips amid economic headwinds
Financial experts said the significant recovery turned the rupee overvalued, which signalled that there was some room for depreciation in the near term.
They pointed out that the uptrend in international oil prices also played a role in the rupee weakness over the past three days as the development forced importers to pay a slightly higher price for the foreign currency. 
The rupee has been fluctuating in a narrow band of Rs279-280/$ for over five weeks. In the open market, the currency remained stable at Rs282.05/$ for the second consecutive day, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan. With this, the disparity between rupee values in the two markets widened to Rs2.74 (almost 1%), about a quarter percentage point away from the maximum limit of 1.25% (around Rs4 at current levels) recommended by the IMF.

4,Expenses shoot up 50% in 7 months,PM considers technocratic-bureaucratic model to run finance ministry,"Expenditures of the federal government shot up 50% to Rs7.5 trillion during the first seven months of the current fiscal year, a challenge that the political leadership is planning to tackle through a technocratic-bureaucratic setup in the finance ministry.
As against expenses of Rs5 trillion during July-January of the last fiscal year, the federal government spent Rs7.53 trillion during the first seven months of the current year, according to sources.
Interest payments on the debt of Rs64.8 trillion came in at Rs4.66 trillion, or 65% of current expenditures.
Sources told The Express Tribune that despite making efforts, the growth in expenditures went above 50% mainly due to the wrong decision of pegging the interest rate with the headline inflation.
Pakistan has kept its interest rate at the highest level of 22% due to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to keep the rate positive against the headline inflation. This is now costing the federal government heavily in the shape of uncontrolled interest payments.
The interest payments of Rs4.66 trillion exceeded the net income of the federal government by Rs280 billion during July-January of fiscal year 2023-24, according to the sources.
Pakistan is far from achieving fiscal consolidation despite significantly slowing down development expenditures. Development expenses stood at only Rs211 billion in seven months, slightly lower than the last fiscal year.
The yawning deficit now stems from the IMF programme, which prevents the central bank from lowering the interest rate. The high rate has failed to curb inflation, which is in double digits above 20%.
Sources said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wanted to run the Ministry of Finance through a technocrat and his trusted bureaucrats.
Mohammad Aurangzeb, President of Habib Bank Limited, has started attending meetings on economic issues. PM Shehbaz has retained his trustworthy Imdad Ullah Bosal as Finance Secretary. Bosal is an experienced hand to assist any technocrat special assistant to the PM.
However, this arrangement may not serve Pakistan’s interests during talks with the IMF, as someone with strong negotiation capabilities will be required to deal with the global lender.
The IMF, in a recent correspondence with Pakistan, has listed further increase in taxes on the salaried and business individuals as a point of negotiation for the next programme review talks.
PM Shehbaz on Monday gave instructions to begin discussions with the IMF for a long-term Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is expected to finalise a short federal cabinet of about 20 ministers in the next few days. At least there would be two ministers from the MQM and one each from the Istehkam-Pakistan Party and PML-Q.
So far, there is no consensus in the party about bringing a politician as a full-time finance minister in place of the experienced Ishaq Dar.
The difficult situation requires a full-time finance minister to deal with the IMF as bureaucrats and technocrats can absorb the lender’s pressure to a certain extent.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Tuesday that the federal government’s debt increased to Rs64.8 trillion by the end of January.
There was an increase of Rs4 trillion in the debt in seven months, which was Rs850 billion higher than the federal deficit despite appreciation of the rupee.
Sources said that the federal budget deficit, including interest payments, amounted to nearly Rs3.2 trillion, or 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), during the first seven months of FY24. The deficit was 40%, or Rs890 billion, higher than the same period of last year.
In its latest report, the IMF has not accepted Pakistan’s budget allocation of Rs7.3 trillion for debt servicing for the current fiscal year. Instead, it put the debt servicing cost at Rs8.61 trillion.
Overall, the federal government has managed to show a primary budget surplus of Rs1.93 trillion. The primary budget surplus is calculated after excluding interest payments, which now exceed the government’s net income.
There was a 51% increase in current expenditures, which amounted to Rs7.2 trillion in seven months. Over 50% increase in expenses shows that the Ministry of Finance cannot claim that it has achieved fiscal consolidation.
Non-tax revenues showed a substantial increase of 105% to Rs2.14 trillion compared to Rs1.1 trillion in the previous year, primarily due to petroleum levy collection and higher profits of the central bank.
The Federal Board of Revenue’s tax collection reached Rs5.15 trillion in seven months, up 30%.
Gross federal revenue receipts amounted to less than Rs7.3 trillion, an increase of Rs2.3 trillion from the previous year. However, the federal government’s total net income, after transferring provincial shares, stood at Rs4.4 trillion, not enough to finance interest payments.

5,Authorities on alert as LPG prices soar,Consumers frustrated as profiteering continues; urgent meeting called,"As liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) hoarders and profiteers increase prices by Rs20 per kg just before Ramazan, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) and LPG Distributors Association are convening today (Wednesday) to develop a joint strategy against this illegal hike.
Chairman OGRA and officials will meet with Chairman of the LPG Distributors Association, Irfan Khokhar, to discuss an action plan against LPG profiteering ahead of Ramazan.
Consumers are bewildered by the surge in prices, while authorities have yet to act against the LPG mafia, which is exploiting consumers for undue profit.
The chairman of the LPG Distributors Association, has called for strong action against this exploitation by the unelected LPG mafia, despite the government’s Ramazan relief package not yet being implemented.

Following the gas price hike, LPG prices have surged, with domestic cylinder prices rising by Rs240 and commercial cylinder prices by Rs910.
While natural gas remains inaccessible, the LPG mafia now exploits LPG as well, completing the cycle of exploitation.
Khokhar stressed that if the government sets the LPG price at Rs257 per kg, it must also ensure availability at this rate. He appealed to the prime minister to address the mafia’s exploitation, which began immediately after his inauguration.
Khokhar insisted that, in addition to lower-priced food items during Ramazan, LPG should also be available at government rates, especially given the decline in global LPG prices.

6,Fish quality certification fee increased,"ECC gives nod for fee revision to regulate exports of fish, fishery products","The government has enhanced the fee on issuing certificates related to the quality and origin of fish and fishery products to regulate their exports from Pakistan.
In a recent meeting, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs briefed the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) that the federal government was authorised to regulate the export of fish and fishery products through the Marine Fisheries Department (MFD), Karachi.
Accordingly, MFD was regulating exports through the Pakistan Fish Inspection and Quality Control Act, 1997 and Pakistan Fish Inspection & Quality Control Rules, 1998.
The fee for the issuance of Certificate of Quality and Origin and other certificates for exports and analysis of various parameters has been provided in Schedule-III of the law.
The ECC gave its nod for the proposal put forward by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs for fee revision.
Under the revised fee structure, the rates for various services provided by MFD have been updated. Notably, the fee for the registration of fish processing plants and establishments has been substantially increased from Rs25,000 to Rs100,000.
The renewal fee for fish processing plants (freezing/ canning plants, firms or exporters) within one month has been hiked from Rs10,000 to Rs50,000 and after the expiry of one month to Rs60,000.
The government has waived the fee of Rs100 for application Form A for the registration of fish processing plants, firms or exporters. The fee for a duplicate registration certificate has been maintained at Rs30,000.
Moreover, the fee for conducting tests and analysis related to the quality and safety of fish and fishery products has been revised.

The fee for the Certificate of Quality and Origin has been increased from Rs1,000 to Rs10,000 for both air and sea shipments. Also, the fee has been raised from Rs1,000 to Rs2,000 for any other certificate to meet the requirement of importing country for buying equipment or other purposes.
The fee for results of any specific tests has gone up from Rs1,500 to Rs5,000. The cost of tests will be in addition to this amount.
Charges for organoleptic tests, physical tests and parameters have been revised from Rs200 to Rs3,000 per parameter. Similarly, the fee for microbiological analysis, including tests for coliforms, Salmonella and others, has been increased substantially, reaching Rs13,000 per sample from Rs1,000.
The Finance Division endorsed the fee revision, highlighting the importance of ensuring compliance with quality standards and regulations governing the export of fish and fishery products.
According to Section 18 of the Pakistan Fish Inspection and Quality Control Act, 1997, the authority to frame fee rules and schedules lies with the federal government.
The ECC’s decision underscores the government’s commitment to enhancing quality control in the fishery sector.
By approving the revised fee, the authorities aim to strengthen the oversight mechanism and uphold the reputation of Pakistani fish and fishery products in international markets.
Now, the industry stakeholders are expected to adapt to the new fee regime while continuing to maintain the high quality and safety standards.

7,Businessmen seek talks with PM,They requested the premier to visit KCCI and discuss all pending issues,"Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh and Businessmen Group (BMG) Chairman Zubair Motiwala have urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to resume the unfinished negotiations initiated during the last few days of his previous tenure as the premier.
They said though all the federal secretaries sent to KCCI had agreed on numerous remedial measures for creating an enabling business environment, most of them remained unimplemented, according to a statement released by the KCCI on Tuesday.
In a letter sent to the PM Office, the KCCI president and BMG chairman said despite assurances from the federal secretaries in the presence of PM Shehbaz during his previous tenure in a meeting held at the PNS Dockyard, most of the issues had not been resolved to date. At the same time, they pointed out, many others had also emerged with the passage of time, particularly the rising energy tariffs having a devastating impact on industries and SMEs, which required the PM’s intervention.
They requested the premier to visit KCCI to provide the business community with an opportunity to bring to light all pending issues.

8,PSX slips amid economic headwinds,"KSE-100 index dips 225.68 points, settles at 65,726.04","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday faced pressure from economic headwinds and lost over 200 points as dismal data indicating a significant 19% year-on-year (YoY) decline in cement sales and an 8% decrease in oil consumption left investors worried about the future course of the economy.
In the morning, the trading session commenced on a strong note, building upon the gains recorded in the prior session. Maintaining the momentum, the KSE-100 index breached the 66,000-point mark and reached its intra-day high at 66,134.84 before midday.
However, the optimism proved short-lived as speculation surrounding the new conditions to be imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pertaining to economic reforms and bridging the tax gap undermined investors’ interest.
Oil and gas companies mainly contributed to the market’s decline. The index erased all prior gains, plunging to the intra-day low at 65,500.06.
Though the bourse recovered somewhat, it closed the day with modest losses owing to the lack of major positive triggers.
“Stocks closed under pressure amid dismal data of cement sales that fell 19% YoY while oil sales decreased 8% YoY in February 2024,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Speculations about new IMF loan conditions for economic reforms and plugging the tax gap, and PM’s nod for talks for a long-term IMF bailout played the role of catalysts in bearish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 225.68 points, or 0.34%, and settled at 65,726.04.
Topline Securities, in its report, said that Pakistan’s stock index concluded the trading day at 65,726, with a decline of 226 points. “Throughout the session, the index demonstrated a mixed trajectory, reaching the high of 66,135 and low of 65,500,” it said.
The downturn was primarily driven by Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Mari Petroleum, Pakistan State Oil and Millat Tractors, which collectively contributed 228 points to the market’s decline.
Conversely, Dawood Hercules Corporation, Attock Refinery and TRG Pakistan added 96 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that 63 shares rose while 33 fell in the KSE-100 index. Dawood Hercules (+4.24%), Attock Refinery (+4.69%) and TRG Pakistan (+2.43%) were the biggest contributors to the index’s gains.
“Near-term support remains at 65,000-65,500, which should halt declines allowing the index to trade through 67,000,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that profit-taking continued across the board as the KSE-100 closed at 65,726, losing 226 points.
“Going forward, we expect range-bound activity and recommend investors to view any downtrend as an opportunity to buy stocks in banking and exploration and production (E&P) sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 396.6 million shares against Monday’s tally of 472.9 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs16.6 billion.
Shares of 352 companies were traded. Of these, 134 stocks closed higher, 204 dropped and 14 remained unchanged.
Kohinoor Spinning Mills was the volume leader with trading in 39.7 million shares, losing Rs0.18 to close at Rs5.50. It was followed by Pakistan Refinery with 34.05 million shares, gaining Rs0.79 to close at Rs28.96 and Pakistan Telecommunication Company with 24.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.14 to close at Rs12.22.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs15.96 million, according to the NCCPL.

9,PM directs hiring of foreign consultant for FBR,Plans to modernise tax machinery signalling departure from previous govt’s restructuring plan,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on Tuesday, directed the hiring of a foreign consultant to modernise the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), indicating a departure from the previously approved restructuring plan. This decision emerged during the PM’s first comprehensive meeting on the administrative affairs of the FBR. The PM stressed the urgent need to engage international consultants and suggested securing a waiver of international competitive bidding from the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority, if necessary, according to officials.
This move suggests that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government may not implement the FBR restructuring plan approved by the previous caretaker government. 
Former Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar virtually attended the meeting and presented her plan. Dr Akhtar may again give a presentation to the PM on Wednesday (today) regarding her restructuring plan.
The foreign consultant will be hired to modernise and digitise the FBR, aiming to eliminate physical contact between tax officials and taxpayers. However, this decision also raises questions about the viability of two foreign loans worth $700 million obtained from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank for domestic revenue mobilisation and FBR modernisation.
Government officials stated that the PM also expressed displeasure over the non-implementation of his eight-month-old orders to install scanners for monitoring various manufacturing units, particularly in the tobacco industry. The PM was informed that there were no funds available for procuring the scanners.
In the meeting, the former finance minister claimed that the FBR did not request funds, but the tax machinery did seek an increase in salaries.
The PM also instructed the hiring of competent individuals from the market to oversee the track and trace system, designed to address underreporting by tobacco manufacturers, beverage producers, sugar companies, and cement manufacturers.
The FBR has long been a contentious issue, and Tuesday’s meeting was no exception. The interim government exacerbated problems in the FBR rather than resolving them. The PM declared digitisation of the FBR as his top priority, stressing its critical importance for Pakistan. He also directed the enforcement of the digital invoicing initiative.
The International Monetary Fund has also called for a substantial increase in tax revenues, with a focus on expanding the tax net to include retailers and wholesalers. So far, its focus has remained on the salaried class and formal sector. FBR Chairman Amjad Zubair Tiwana briefed the PM on initiatives taken to combat corruption in the tax machinery, highlighting how digitisation of the FBR would help address corruption issues.
The FBR chairman mentioned that this fiscal year, they aim to bring an additional 1.5 million taxpayers into the fold. Legislation has been enacted for digitising invoicing, which the prime minister directed was for immediate implementation.
So far, the FBR has received fewer than four million income tax returns, about 35% less than the comparative period. Last tax year, nearly six million individuals and entities filed returns.
The PM commended the FBR for achieving the eight-month revenue target of Rs5.830 trillion. However, the FBR missed targets in the last months, and overall target achievement was possible only due to better performance in the first half of the fiscal year.
