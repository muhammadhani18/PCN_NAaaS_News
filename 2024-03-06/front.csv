0,Fairness score of polls lowest since 2013,PILDAT report highlights key issues that negatively affected quality of 2024 elections,"The Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on Wednesday reported that the fairness score of this year’s general elections had plummeted to its lowest level since 2013.
A report issued by Pildat pointed out that the 2024 general polls scored only 49% in terms of the overall quality – a figure that was lower than those of the past two elections – 52% and 57% in 2018 and 2013, respectively.
The report observed that the overall assessment score for the pre-poll phase in 2024 general elections stood at 50%, matching that of 2018 but falling significantly short of 62% in 2013.
One part of the report assessed the voting process itself, including the performance of polling staff, the quality of polling stations, and safety during voting hours.
According to the report, the assessment score received for this year’s general elections stands at 58% for this part against 64% in 2018.
“This shows that in our assessment, the phase of polling day, including the voting process, performance of polling staff, quality of polling stations, and safety during voting hours was assessed to be poorer than that of [the] 2018 general election[s], the report read.
“However, it scored higher than the score of [the 2013] general elections [that] stood at 44%,” it continued.
“The part two of the polling day phase was about the counting of votes, compilation and transmission of results from polling stations to returning officers, consolidation of constituency results and announcement of provisional results.”
The assessment score assigned to this phase in this year’s general election stood at 40%, which was identical to that of the 2018 polls.
The report pointed out that the 2013 general elections received the score of 50% in this phase, while in both 2002 and 2008 polls, it stood at 47%.
It noted that the 2024 elections ranking level stood at 40% for the post-polls phase.  It added that this was an all-time low score, which mirrored that of the 2002 general elections that had witnessed unprecedented post-poll rigging in recent years. “This low score indicates a low level of trust for the post-election phase,” it read.
The Pildat report highlighted the key issues that had negatively affected the quality of the 2024 general elections.
They included considerable delays in scheduling of the elections in the pre-poll phase, political repression, lack of impartiality from the caretaker governments and state institutions as well as the worsening law and order situation in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
On polling day, the suspension of mobile phone and internet services not only compromised the Election Management System (EMS) but also created problems for public participation in the electoral process.
After polling was completed, the delay in the announcement of the provisional results beyond the deadline fixed under Section 13(3) of the Elections Act, 2017, prompted serious questions about the credibility of elections.
The Pildat report observed that the widespread allegations of discrepancy between Forms-45 and Form-47 have also added to the concerns about the credibility of the polls.
The delay in the publishing of Forms 45, 46, 48 and 49 on the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) website – in violation of Section 95 (10) of the Elections Act, 2017 -- has further damaged the credibility of the elections.
Lastly, Pildat noted that the allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) – a smaller party that accommodated PTI-backed independent lawmakers -- continued to be a major point of contention for 25 days since the polling day.
It added that the reserved seats were eventually allotted to other political parties.
Pildat recommended that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into (1) the delays in the transmission, consolidation and announcement of provisional results, (2) the lack of contingency planning to meet result issuance deadlines in case of the EMS inoperability, and (3) the failure to publish signed copies of forms 45, 46, 48 and 49 within 14 days of polling day as required under the Elections Act, 2017.

It also recommended that election tribunals should be allowed to resolve disputes on a case-by-case basis. The second recommendation is to form a commission of enquiry like the one formed to probe into the 2013 general elections.
A day earlier, Gallup Pakistan issued a separate report which stated that overall, the PTI-backed independent candidates attained the most vote share (31%) followed by the PML-N (24%) and PPP (14%).
It further read that in Punjab, a close contest took place between PTI-backed independent candidates (36%) and PML-N (34%) for the vote share.
It added that in Sindh, the PPP led with a majority vote share (46%), with the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) trailing behind at 10%.
In K-P, the report stated that the PTI-backed independent candidates took the highest vote share (47%), with the JUI-F coming in second (16%).
In Balochistan, independent candidates took the lead in vote share (20%), with the JUI-F coming in second at 14%.
In Islamabad, a close contest was witnessed between the PTI-backed independent candidates (33%) and PML-N (32%) for the vote share.
The report read that the PTI had the highest vote share in K-P (47%), Punjab (36%) and ICT (33%). It continued that the PPP had the highest share in Sindh (46%) and the PML-N in Balochistan (14%).
In term of the seats won, the Gallup report stated that overall, the PTI-backed independent candidates led with 93 seats and the PML-N came in second with 75 seats.
In 70 constituencies across Pakistan, the PTI-backed independent candidates had a victory margin of 10-50%.
In Punjab, the PML-N led with 67 seats while the PTI-backed independent candidates came in second with 54 seats.
In 61 constituencies of Punjab, the PML-N had a victory margin of 5-10%.
In Sindh, the PPP (44 seats) and MQM-P (17 seats) reigned supreme in the province.
In 74 constituencies of Sindh, the PPP had a victory margin of 10-50%.
In K-P, the PTI-backed independent candidates took an unassailable lead with 38 seats. In 34 constituencies of K-P, the PTI-backed independent candidates had a victory margin of 10-50%.
In Balochistan, the PML-N took a narrow lead with four seats.
In eight constituencies of Balochistan, the PPP had a victory margin of 10-50%.
The PML-N took a lead in Islamabad with two seats while a PTI-backed independent candidate secured one seat. In the two constituencies of Islamabad, the PML-N had a victory margin of 5-10% and 10-50%, respectively.

1,"SC not to interfere in ECP’s work, says CJ",Bench turns down JUI-F’s plea for re-polling at 11 polling stations of Ziarat,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled it would not interfere in the working of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) unless there was a violation of the Constitution, as a three-member bench dismissed a petition for re-polling at 11 polling stations in Balochistan.
The bench, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, heard the appeal filed by Khalilur Rahman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), seeking the court’s order for re-polling at 11 polling stations of the Balochistan Assembly constituency,PB-7 Ziarat.
The bench rejected the appeal against the decision of the ECP. The chief justice told the lawyer for the appellant that unless the court was informed about any illegal or unconstitutional act of the ECP, it would not interfere in the working of the election oversight.
The chief justice asked the lawyer, where the Constitution was violated in the ECP decision. The counsel replied that the ECP did not conduct an enquiry. The chief justice told the lawyer if there was any issue with the election results, the relevant forum should be approached.
Sitting on the bench, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar asked whether there was any rigging in the election. On that the lawyer replied that the election was rigged. Justice Mazhar told the lawyer that he should prove the rigging at the relevant forum.
“The Constitution is very clear, the Election Commission [of Pakistan] is a constitutional body and it must be respected,” the chief justice remarked. He added that if there was no violation of the Constitution or the law, the court would not interfere.

2,PHC stops oath-taking on reserved seats,Refers PTI plea against ECP’s March 5 order to CJ for formation of a larger bench,"The provincial high court of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has halted candidates of various political parties, who were allocated additional reserved seats in the National Assembly on the order of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), from taking oath until today (Thursday).
A division bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), comprising Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Shakeel Ahmad, issued this order on Wednesday while hearing a constitutional petition filed by the PTI.
The ECP, on Monday, declined to allocate reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC)—which comprises PTI-backed lawmakers—because it had not submitted a “priority list” for these seats prior to the February 8 general elections.
In its written order, the ECP stated that the SIC was not entitled to claim quotas for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims “due to non-curable legal defects and violation of the mandatory provision of submission of a priority list for reserved seats, which is a requirement of the law.”
The polls oversight authority noted that reserved seats in the National Assembly shall not remain vacant and will be allocated through proportional representation to other political parties.
The PTI subsequently approached the PHC against the order. In its petition, the PTI argued that the ECP allocated its reserved seats to other parties in violation of Article 51(6) of the Constitution, read with Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017, and Rules 92 and 94 of the Election Rules, 2017.
During the hearing on Wednesday, Justice Ibrahim inquired whether this case is limited to the K-P or extends to the entire country. The PTI’s lawyer, Qazi Anwar, stated that the ECP made a uniform decision on seats in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies.
“Our reserved seats cannot be constitutionally or legally divided among other parties. We request the court to prevent those who will take oath on those reserved seats,” he said.

Justice Shakeel Ahmad asked the lawyer whether he argued that if the seats could not be allotted to the SIC due to non-submission of the priority list, they cannot be allotted to other parties as well as they also had not submitted lists for those seats earlier.
After the arguments, the bench issued a stay order on the swearing-in of new lawmakers on the reserved seats until today, while sending notices to the ECP and other parties. It also issued notices to the attorney-general for Pakistan and the KP advocate general for assistance.
The bench referred the case to the PHC chief justice for the formation of a larger bench to review six legal questions. The bench noted that a larger bench will have to determine whether the PHC has jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter and if the petitioner (PTI) has locus standi to file the petition.
“[The larger bench will have to determine] whether the petitioner is entitled to claim the quota for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in view of the express provisions of Article 51(6) of the Constitution, read with Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017, and Rules 92 and 94 of the Election Rules, 2017.
“[It will also have to determine] whether the defect of non-submission of a list for the seats reserved for women and non-Muslims by a political party is not curable under the law?
It noted that the PHC will also have to determine whether the reserved seats can be kept vacant or are liable to be allocated through proportional representation to other political parties based on the general seats won by these political parties.
“[The larger bench will also have to decide] whether the ECP has misconceived and misinterpreted the provisions of Article 51(6) of the Constitution, read with Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017, and Rules 92 and 94 of the Election Rules, 2017,” it said.
Earlier, speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the party will also approach the Sindh High Court (SHC) against the ECP’s March 5 order.
“We hope that the courts will decide the matter according to the Constitution and relevant laws. Today, we had consultations with the PTI founder, Imran Khan, in jail. It has been decided that Omar Ayub will be the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly,” he said.

3,Election result buries May 9 narrative: Imran,PTI founder demands audit of four constituencies to confirm rigging claims," 
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan said on Wednesday the narrative about May 9 incidents was buried after the results of the February 8 general elections, which he described as the “most rigged” in the country's history.
Imran endorsed a military commanders declaration that those involved in the May 9, 2023 attacks on sensitive state installations must be punished, stressing that the actual culprits should be identified through the CCTV footage.
In an informal conversation with media representatives during the hearing of a case inside Adiala Jail, Imran said that the PTI was not against the army and emphasised that the criticism over election rigging was not the criticism of the army.
On Tuesday, the Corps Commanders’ Conference reiterated the commitment that planners, instigators, abettors, perpetrators and desecrators of martyrs’ monuments and attackers of military installations on May 9, would be brought to justice under the law.
The PTI founder said that he fully supported the statement of the conference. “Those accused of May 9 tragedy should be severely punished. He suggested that those involved in the violent attacks should be identified through CCTV footage.

On May 9 last year, PTI supporters resorted to violent protests after Imran’s arrest in a corruption case. On that day, rioters torched the residence of the corps commander in Lahore, attacked the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi and damaged other installations and monuments elsewhere.
Imran termed the riots a tragedy but said that no one seemed interested in an independent inquiry into the attacks. “Why judicial commission has not yet been formed to investigate the May 9 tragedy,"" he asked.
He said that the narrative about May 9 was buried in the February 8 vote. “People do not believe that we have committed any treachery. No one in our party is against the army. How criticism of the election rigging can be criticism of the army?”
Imran also slammed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not allocating the reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) – the party which was joined by the PTI-backed independents in a move to qualify for those seats.
“Depriving the PTI of the reserved seats amounted to a negation of democracy. How can those who were not entitled to have the reserved seats get the allocation,” he said. “In the [former] East Pakistan, people were deprived of the mandate, which led to the break-up of the country [in 1971], he added.
The PTI founder termed the February 8 elections “most rigged” in the country's history and blamed the former caretaker government and the ECP for it. “Even the election winners know that rigging is committed,” he said, adding that the PTI would hold a protest rally in Peshawar on Sunday.
He called for the audit of only four constituencies to confirm the rigging claims – victory of Noor Alam from Peshawar, Nawaz Sharif and Aun Chaudhry from Lahore, and any constituency of Islamabad. “Only three parties benefited from this election,” he said.

Imran stressed that without political stability, the country could not function. He said that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) did not get even 25 seats but its government had been formed. “Sharif family’s politics relies on the SIFC [Special Investment Facilitation Council].
He stated that he had informed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) previously that the economy could not improve without political stability, achievable only through transparent elections. Addressing a query, he clarified that there were no negotiations with anyone while in jail.
Meanwhile, Accountability Judge Nasir Javed Rana heard the £190 million reference against the PTI founder and his wife Bushra Bibi. On Tuesday, three witnesses recorded their statements, while the defence lawyer completed cross examination of two witnesses. The hearing was put off till March 13.
Separately, a two-member bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri, issued notices to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on the bail application of Imran in the £190 million reference and adjourned the hearing until next week.

4,Ruling alliance mulls discarding NAB,"Newly-stitched alliance is aiming for at least three major constitutional amendments, including abolishing the NAB","The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led newly-stitched ruling alliance is aiming to go for at least three major constitutional amendments, including abolishing the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), restoring articles 62 and 63 to their original position and empowering local governments, it emerged on Tuesday.
Just days after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took oath and even before finalising the federal cabinet, insiders revealed that the PML-N along with its allies, including Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarian (PPPP), Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), among others, was already working on these constitutional amendments.
“You can say that these three amendments are on the cards,” a PML-N leader shared at a time when the rigging allegations have made the recently-concluded general elections controversial and the parties sitting on opposition benches are accusing the ruling alliance of stealing their mandate and protesting against it.
Among other things, he, however, refrained from confirming if a move to give an extension to the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) for three years was also under consideration.
Initially, the PML-N leader said, the party was eying only two amendments; abolishing NAB and changing the wording of Articles 62 and 63 back to the original, saying both were also included in the party’s manifesto as well.
He said that PPPP already agreed with these two proposals and it was PML-N, which has been delaying it.
The third has recently been included, he maintained, after the PML-N and MQM-P inked a formal agreement to empower local government, saying this was the reason MQM-P decided to sit on treasury benches.
The MQM-P-proposed amendment wants the federation to establish local governments under Article 140-A. In addition, it wants to introduce Articles 140-B (which deals with the powers and functions of the local governments) and Article 140-C (which relates to the finances of the local governments).
Background discussion with PML-N leaders revealed that the addition of reserved seats has emboldened the ruling alliance to take practical steps as a two-thirds majority is required for the constitutional amendments.
Currently, they said, 225 (67%) out of the 336-member National Assembly was needed for making a constitutional amendment, saying PM Shehbaz’s election already ensured that the coalition had support from 201 members.
The rest can come from the additional reserve seats being distributed among the parties, they said, after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) ruled that the Sunni Ittehad Council — the new home of PTI-affiliated lawmakers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) — was not eligible for the reserve seats and the same would be distributed among other political parties based on the proportional representation formula.
Expectedly, they said, the remaining seats would put the ruling parties in a position where they can go for the constitutional amendments.
On one hand, they noted, the PML-N-led government is gearing up for the constitutional amendments while, on the other hand, the PTI-SIC lawmakers are spending energy on protests that wouldn’t cause any hindrance in legislation when the ruling alliance’s required number is complete in NA.
In January, the three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif while launching the manifesto had declared in unequivocal terms that if the PML-N secures victory in the Feb 8 general elections, NAB will be abolished.
Back in 2018, while grappling with three corruption references, Nawaz had expressed regret that he could not eliminate what he termed “draconian NAB laws” during his tenure. “Abolish NAB,” the PML-N’s 51-page manifesto stated. “[It will] strengthen existing anti-corruption institutions and agencies.”
In addition to the NAB abolition pledge, Nawaz, who faced disqualification under articles 62 and 63 and rallied behind the slogan of 'Vote Ko Izzat Do' (Respect the Vote), had vowed in the manifesto to establish the unequivocal supremacy of parliament.
To do that, the party leader said, Articles 62 and 63 would be amended or restored to their original position of 1973, while Article 63-A would also be clarified.
Under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of Pakistan, a person cannot be qualified as a member of the national or provincial legislatures if he is not ‘Sadiq and Ameen’ – truthful and trustworthy.
Reportedly, on March 2, 1985, General Ziaul Haq had issued the Revival of Constitution of 1973 Order (RCO), changing 67 clauses and sections of 280 articles of the Constitution.
It represented the largest number of changes in a single stroke in the history of Pakistan. Some of the reworked language was clauses in Article 62, which now required members of parliament to meet the conditions of being Sadiq and Ameen – two Arabic terms which were never clearly defined in English, the language of the Constitution.
The party’s 2024 to 2029 manifesto also promises judges’ accountability; time-bound disposal of complaints against judges of superior courts; live telecast of important matters under adjudication before the superior courts, including the proceedings of the Supreme Judicial Council; and vowed that an inclusive procedure for appointment of superior court judges on merit would be adopted.

5,"Punjab, K-P bid adieu to caretakers as cabinets sworn in","Fresh faces dominate Maryam’s cabinet; Gandapur appoints 15 ministers, 5 advisers","The process of government formation advanced on Wednesday with the swearing-in ceremonies for both the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) cabinets.
Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman administered the oath to 18 ministers in Lahore, attended by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. In Peshawar, Governor Haji Ghulam Ali swore in 15 ministers, with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur present.
Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz appears to have preferred fresh faces over old guards as more than half of her eighteen-member cabinet comprises first-time ministers.
Meanwhile, in a somewhat surprising move, despite having a coalition partner in PML-Q, her cabinet did not feature any member from IPP, even as strong rumours suggested the party's parliamentary secretary was in line for a ministerial position.
The oath-taking ceremony took place at the Governor House Punjab, where eighteen MPs were sworn in. Of these eighteen members, twelve are set to function as provincial ministers in Punjab for the first time.
If Azma Bukhari, whose term lasted a mere four days, is to be included, the count of first-timers rises to thirteen. She has been given the information ministry.
In addition, Marriyum Aurangzeb, who previously served as a federal minister for information and broadcasting, is making her debut in Punjab to assist CM Maryam, who lacks parliamentary or firsthand experience of working in the government of her own.
However, not all first-time ministers lack political experience, as some have held elected positions in the past.
For instance, Mian Muhammad Kazim Hussain Peerzada, assigned to the irrigation ministry, served as a parliamentary secretary and tehsil nazim.

Similarly, Rana Sikandar Hayat, who is now handling the portfolios of school education and literacy and non-formal basic, served as a district chairman in Kasur during the last local body's term.
Other newcomers to the cabinet include Sohaib Ahmad Malik, the nephew of incumbent Chief Secretary Punjab Zahid Akhtar Zaman, assigned civil & works; Ramesh Singh Arora from Kartarpur; Faisal Ayub Khokhar from Lahore; Zeehsan Raffique from Sialkot; Bilal Akbar Khan from Narowal; Syed Muhammad Ashiq Hussain Shah from Okara.
Strikingly, the list also features Sohail Shaukat Butt, reportedly accused of high-profile murders. Sohail, despite his notoriety, ascended in party ranks after securing relief for Shehbaz Sharif's immediate family in a viral bakery fight incident on social media.
Sardar Sher Ali Gorchani, who previously served as deputy speaker, will be a provincial minister for the first time, overseeing the mines and mineral portfolio.
Chaudhry Shafay Hussain, son of PML-Q's Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, has also found a place in the provincial cabinet, despite lacking parliamentary experience. He has been appointed as the minister for commerce and industry.
A senior PML-N leader, when questioned about IPP's absence from the list, said he was also unaware of the reason behind their absence from the list.
Following the oath-taking, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz conveyed her best wishes to the new ministers, emphasizing their responsibility to meet public expectations. Marriyum Aurangzeb was appointed as the senior minister, assigned portfolios including Planning and Development, along with Forests and Environment, according to a government notification.
The newly appointed ministers for Punjab are Mujtaba Shuja (Finance), Kazim Pirzada (Irrigation), Uzma Bukhari (Information and Broadcasting), Rana Sikandar Hayat (Primary Education), Khawaja Imran Nazir (Primary Health), Khawaja Salman Naseer Rafiq (Specialised Health), Asiq Kirmani (Agriculture), Khalil Tahir Sindhu (Human Rights), Ramesh Arora (Minority Affairs), Faisal Khokhar (Sports), Zeeshan Rafiq (Local Government), Sohail Bharat (Communications), Chaudhry Shafay Hussain (Trade and Industry), Sher Ali Gorchani (Mines and Minerals), and Sohail Shaukat (Social Welfare).

In Peshawar, the 15-member K-P cabinet was sworn in after approval from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.
K-P Governor Ghulam Ali administered the oath at a ceremony attended by PTI workers, with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur present.
The ministers include Arshad Ayub, Shakeel Ahmad, Fazal Hakeem, Adnan Qadri, Aqibullah, Muhammad Sajjad, Meena Khan, Fazl Shakoor, Nazir Abbasi, Pakhtunyar, Aftab Alam, Khaliqur Rehman, Qasim Ali Shah, Faisal Tarakai, and Muhammad Zahir Shah Toro.
The chief minister also appointed five advisers. They are Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, Syed Fakhar Jahan, Muzamil Aslam, Mashal Azam and Zahid Chan Zeb.
Many new faces have appeared in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa cabinet and government team.
They include Fazal Hakeem Khan from Swat, Muhammad Adnan Qadri from Khyber, Aqibullah Khan from Swabi, Faisal Khan Turkai from Swabi, Mohammad Sajjad from Karak, Meena Khan Afridi from Peshawar, Qasim Ali Shah from Peshawar, Nazir Ahmad Abbas from Abbottabad, Pakhtun Yar from Bannu, Aftab Alam from Kohat, and Zahir Shah Toro from Mardan.
However, the new K-P cabinet and government team includes relatives of many former ministers and officials.
K-P minister Qasim Ali Shah's father Agha Syed Ali Shah has remained a provincial minister and mayor of Peshawar.
Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser’s brother, Aqibullah, has also been appointed as a provincial minister.
Ex-senior minister Shahram Turkai’s brother, Faisal Turkai, has become a minister as well.
Shahram has been a minister in the cabinets of former K-P chief ministers Pervez Khattak and Mahmood Khan as well as remained the district nazim of Swabi.
Another member of the newly appointed K-P cabinet, Adnan Qadri, is a nephew of former federal minister Noorul Haq Qadri.
Similarly, Arshad Ayub, who has also been sworn in as a K-P cabinet member, is a brother of former provincial ministers Akbar Ayub Khan and Yusuf Ayub Khan as well as a cousin of PTI Central General Secretary Omar Ayub Khan.

6,SC admits Bhutto’s unfair trial after 44 years,Nine-member bench unveils its brief opinion on a presidential reference filed over a decade back,"The Supreme Court admitted on Wednesday that former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was not given the right to a fair trial, almost 44 years after the founding chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was hanged in a murder case.
A nine-member larger bench of the apex, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, announced its opinion on a presidential reference filed by former president Asif Ali Zardari more than a decade ago. The announcement was also broadcast live on the YouTube channel of the Supreme Court.
The chief justice announced the court’s reserved written order, which said Bhutto's trial in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and then in the Supreme Court was not conducted in accordance with the fundamental rights and fair trial provided by the Constitution.
The larger bench included Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Musarrat Hilali.
“The good thing is that the opinion on the presidential reference is unanimous,” Chief Justice Isa said before announcing the opinion. “We cannot move forward without correcting ourselves until we acknowledge the mistakes of the past,” he said, while announcing the court’s opinion.
Late Bhutto was convicted in the murder case of Muhammad Khan Kasuri by the LHC, over a year after the toppling of his government on July 5, 1977 by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq. Later, Bhutto’s appeal against his conviction was rejected by the Supreme Court through a 4-3 split verdict.
The PPP always contended that the party founder and the country’s first elected prime minister was falsely convicted and hanged. During the PPP government from 2008-13, the then president sent a reference to the apex court to review the case and acquit Bhutto.
The chief justice noted that the reference was filed during the PPP government but it was not withdrawn by the subsequent governments. He added that not withdrawing the reference reflected the collective will of the people of Pakistan.
The reference put up five questions. In the brief written opinion, the Supreme Court did not answer the second and fourth questions. The court gave its opinion on three questions.
To the first question, whether the LHC and the Supreme Court decision met the requirements of fundamental rights, the bench said that the proceedings did not meet the requirements of the fundamental right to a fair trial and due process enshrined in Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution.
However, the court noted that the Constitution and the law did not provide a mechanism to set aside the judgment of Bhutto’s conviction and sentence; therefore, the judgment attained finality after the dismissal of the review petition by the apex court.
On the second question, whether the decision of the Supreme Court was binding on all other courts, the court opined that it could not be answered whether any principle of law enunciated in the Bhutto case had already been dissented to or overruled.

On the questions 3 and 5, whether in the death sentence was justified or it could amount to deliberate murder of the late Bhutto, the bench opined that in its advisory jurisdiction, the court could not reappraise the evidence and undo the decision of the case.
On the question 4, whether the Bhutto case decision fulfilled the requirements of Islamic laws, the bench opined that the court was not “rendered any assistance on this question, therefore, it would be inappropriate to render an opinion.”
The chief justice emphasised that it was the constitutional responsibility of the judges to fulfil their responsibilities in accordance with the Constitution. As a judge, he added, the decisions should be made according to the law without any fear, temptation or attachment.
He said there were some cases in the judicial history, which shaped public opinion that the judiciary succumbed to intimidation or temptation, while fulfilling its responsibilities. “We have to hold ourselves accountable by openly admitting our past mistakes,” he added.
The Supreme Court would issue the detailed opinion, later.
“We will point out the constitutional and legal flaws in the trial and legal procedure in the Zalfikar Ali Bhutto trial in a detailed opinion,” the chief justice observed.
Bhutto’s grandson and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari termed the Supreme Court’s opinion “historic” and expressed the hope that it would help the country progress on all fronts. “It was difficult for ordinary people to trust the judicial system when a popular leader like Bhutto couldn’t get justice.”
In a post on X, Bilawal said the SC’s opinion came “44 years after judicial murder and more than 12 years after [the] presidential reference was filed”.
He added: “The pursuit of justice was a labour of love by (former) President Asif Ali Zardari in the name of his wife Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Our family waited 3 generations to hear these words.”

7,PML-N lines up bigwigs to aid CM Maryam,Punjab cabinet likely to take oath today,"The cabinet of Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz is anticipated to include around two dozen members, with about fifteen ministers and the remainder serving as advisers and special assistants, according to a well-informed source who is also expected to be given a provincial ministry.
Unverified reports suggested that the oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for Wednesday (today). However, as of the filing of this report, the Directorate General of Public Relations confirmed the possibility of the ceremony at 4pm in the Governor House. It was clarified that there was no official confirmation from the CM office or the Governor House.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, sources revealed that there were initially two plans under consideration for the cabinet's induction – one involving the phased introduction of ministers and advisers, and the other opting for a single ceremony.
Despite reports circulating about the oath-taking ceremony on Wednesday, no official confirmation has been received, and those expected to take the oath have not received invitations.
Concerning the cabinet composition, the source mentioned that Maryam Nawaz's cabinet is anticipated to feature her longstanding associate Pervez Rashid, slated to serve as an adviser to the chief minister.
In addition, the party’s information secretary and former federal minister for information, Marriyum Aurangzeb, who has been relocated to Punjab to support CM Maryam – who lacks parliamentary work experience – is expected to be assigned to the planning and development ministry.
Meanwhile, Rana Sanaullah, the former interior minister with extensive experience in Punjab, was initially expected to remain in the province and aid Nawaz Sharif's daughter in managing provincial bureaucracy.
However, the source indicated that it was unlikely for him to serve in the province.
He said that Rana Sanaullah might choose a position at the Centre and explained that the ex-interior minister, who failed to secure his seat in the recent elections, has two options available – a position at the Centre or in the province.
The source added that the role of an advisor to the chief executive in Punjab would not suit his stature. However, if Rana Sanaullah stays in Punjab, he could assist Maryam in navigating the bureaucratic maze.
Azma Bukhari is expected to head the information ministry, while Mujtaba Shuja-ur-Rehman is likely to be appointed to the excise and taxation ministry.
PML-N's coalition partners, Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), and PML-Q will each receive a ministry. Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain's son, Chaudhry Shafay Hussain, from PML-Q, and Ghazanfar Abbas Cheena from IPP, will be entrusted with ministerial portfolios.
Other individuals joining the cabinet include Khawaja Imran Nazir, Salman Naeem, Rana Sikandar Hayat, Bilal Yasin, and Faisal Ayub Khokhar, who is the son of Saiful Malook Khokhar. The Khokhar family is said to be financiers of Maryam Nawaz.
The source further said that Rana Masud, who has served in the province on multiple occasions, will be accommodated at the Centre. However, he expressed unawareness regarding whether Col (retd) Ayub Gadi would be assigned any responsibilities.
Salman Naeem, a PML-N MPA, told The Express Tribune that he has not received communication about any oath-taking ceremony thus far. When questioned about the portfolio he might be given, he stated that he was not aware of his assigned portfolio.
