0,Resolution in Senate to seek Imran's release,"PTI leaders submit resolution calling for dismissal of 'illegal cases' against party leaders, journalists","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday submitted a resolution to the National Assembly Secretariat, calling for the release of its founding chairman Imran Khan, alongside other political leaders and journalists.
Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, along with other leaders, presented the resolution.The resolution stressed Imran Khan's leadership role in the Muslim ummah and called for the dismissal of illegal cases against him.
It demanded the immediate release of the former prime minister, who remains incarcerated in Adiala Jail, calling for an end to the “abuse of law”.In addition to Imran Khan, the resolution also demanded the release of prominent PTI leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Pervez Elahi, and Umar Sarfraz Cheema.
It also demanded the release of other political figures including Sanam Javed, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mehmood ur Rasheed, and all political prisoners.
The resolution argued that the cases against PTI's founder were based on ""illegitimate and political motives"", lacking any legal standing. It criticised these actions as detrimental to both the nation and its people, asserting that they were orchestrated without substantial evidence to divert public support from PTI.
Furthermore, the resolution condemned the arrests of journalists and called for the immediate closure of cases against Imran Riaz Khan and Asad Toor.Speaking to media outside the National Assembly, Asad Qaiser, a PTI leader who joined SIC in the wake of the February 8 elections, asserted that Imran Khan was the foremost political leader in the country.
""Reiterating allegations of PTI being stripped of its mandate, Qaiser said that Form 45 serves as a crucial document for the ECP, representing a specific result. He alleged that Form-45 displayed one result, while Form-47 showed a different outcome.The former NA speaker asserted that the party will firmly uphold its rights.
""Our battle extends beyond politics; it is now a fight for our nation,"" he declared.Asad Qaiser reiterated the primary demand for all institutions to adhere to constitutional boundaries.""Our primary objective is to ensure the independence of the judiciary, enabling it to make impartial decisions without succumbing to external pressures.
Unfortunately, 180 of our seats were unfairly revoked,"" he said while lamenting the loss of reserved seats.He further said that the PTI’s movement would continue, pledging to rally political forces and conduct a lawful and constitutional mass movement.
He warned that if PTI’s rights were not acknowledged, the party would take to the streets.

1,Vawda slams ‘unnecessary’ targeting of institutions,Ex-federal minister lauds army’s statement on ‘false claims’ that it was interfering in polls,"Lauding the military's statement against the 'politically-driven campaign’, former federal minister Faisal Vawda on Tuesday said that such a tough stance from the military's top brass should have been taken many years ago.
Speaking to a private TV news channel, Vawda said that over the past decade, all political parties had ""unnecessarily"" aimed their arrows at institutions. ""If this interference had been halted earlier, we wouldn't be facing the current situation,"" he added.
""Nevertheless, better late than never. It's a positive step."" The former PTI leader further said that allegations against Supreme Court judges should not be made without evidence, stating that there was a proper procedure for such matters, which involves referring them to the Supreme Judicial Council.
Similarly, Vawda urged those with issues against the military to follow established mechanisms rather than resorting to unacceptable social media criticism. “However, it is unacceptable to speak against [the military] on social media.”
Vawda accused certain individuals of running a specific campaign on social media platforms solely for financial gain, claiming that the more criticism they receive, the more views they garner, ultimately earning dollars.
According to him, these individuals have done nothing substantial for the country and are merely lining their pockets. “The more you criticise, the more views you receive and earn dollars.”
Lauding the stance taken by the military, Vawda described it as crucial for Pakistan's autonomy and survival. “Taking action against past mistakes is a commendable step. Whoever is involved should be dealt with promptly without any leniency.”
Speaking about last year’s May 9 violence, Vawda asked if PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen was claiming that it was all “staged “, and was the attack on party founding chairman Imran Khan also a “drama”. He said that both incidents were real.

2,FIA’s adjournment plea in cypher case rejected,Imran’s lawyer tells IHC that FIR was filed after delay of 17 months,"The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) prosecutor’s adjournment plea on Tuesday was rejected by the Islamabad High Court in the cipher case on the grounds that the bench was currently hearing the arguments presented by the defence lawyer representing PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and they were not going to conclude in a day.
As IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb started the hearing of the maintainability of the appeal filed by the deposed premier against the sentence handed down to him in the cipher case, FIA Special Prosecutor Hamid Ali Shah informed the court that the paper books of the matter were not ready yet.
He further said records had to be reviewed and time was needed to prepare the case. The prosecutor continued that any unnecessary adjournment would not be sought once the case had started.
Justice Aurangzeb pointed out that the appellant's lawyer had just started his arguments and they would not conclude in a day.
Imran’s lawyer Barrister Salman Safdar argued before the court that the cipher case concerned the foreign affairs ministry but it was the then interior secretary Yousuf Naseem Khokhar, who filed the complaint.
He further pointed out that the FIR was filed after a delay of 17 months.
The defence counsel further informed the court that former prime minister's principal secretary Azam Khan was the accused in the FIR but he was cited as a witness in the challan.
Safdar explained the background of the case and read out the text of the FIR. He added that there are two aspects to this appeal -- the merits of the case and the other one related to how it was handled.
He said Azam went missing, a petition was filed in this connection, and an FIR was registered.
The court inquired was this all part of the case. The defence lawyer replied in the negative.
Safdar told the court that Azam was cross-examined by the government’s defense counsel but not asked any question about his alleged abduction.
Justice Aurangzeb inquired whether or not the government’s lawyer had asked Azam about his alleged abduction despite knowing all the facts.
The IHC CJ observed that a person, who had been appointed the defence counsel, had to fulfill their responsibility.
Safdar said the defense counsel completed the cross-examination of 21 witnesses in 48 hours.
He added that the courts had made it clear that someone could only be arrested in the presence of solid evidence.
The IHC CJ remarked that there were certain requirements for arresting a person.
He added that unfortunately, a mindset prevailed in the country that an FIR was enough to round up someone.
The judge noted that it was practice in the civilised world to call a person for an investigation first. He continued that if the person cooperated in the investigation, there was no need to arrest them but it was a different situation if something had to be recovered.
Safdar said it would take him around two hours to complete his arguments.
Justice Aurangzeb noted that this was not an ordinary FIR and this was the first case of its kind. The IHC CJ told the defence lawyer that he should not take the matter so easily and come full prepared in the future.
The hearing was adjourned till March 11.

Around 40 senators are set to retire with their six-year-term coming to an end on March 11 as a few political parties will entirely lose their representation in the upper house.
Senators are elected for a period of six years and the polls for the seats in the upper house are not held at once.
After every six years, half of the senators retire after the completion of their tenure and fresh polls are held to fill the vacant seats.
From the PTI, seven senators are retiring including leader of the opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem, Walid Iqbal, Faisal Javed, Fida Muhammad, Muhammad Azam Khan Swati, Mehr Taj Roghani, and Seemee Ezdi.
Among the 12 PPP senators, the prominent ones include Bahramand Khan Tangi, Mian Raza Rabbani, Maula Bux Chandio, Syed Waqar Mehdi, Rubina Khalid, Anwar Lal Dean, Keshoo Bai, Khalida Sikandar Mandhro, and Ali Shah Jamot.

4,ECP uploads Form 45 to its website,PTI describes Form 45s made public by electoral watchdog as ‘tampered’ ones," 
Amid allegations of rigging and tampering with results by the opposition parties especially the PTI in terms of Forms 45, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday finally uploaded all the documents related to the February 8 polls to its website – well after the expiry of the deadline of making them public on 22nd of last month.
The electoral watchdog has uploaded Forms 45, 46, 48 and 49 of the National Assembly and the four provincial legislature’s constituencies.
However, the move has not been able to satisfy the PTI, which has described the Forms 45 uploaded by the ECP as “tampered” ones.
The PTI has been claiming that it was in possession of “original and signed Form-45s”, which were proof of massive “fraud” in the compilation” of election results.
Addressing a news conference following the announcement of the results last month, PTI leader Raoof Hasan said his party-backed candidates had been given only 92 seats in the NA against its estimate of 177.
He claimed that the PTI-backed candidates had been “fraudulently” deprived of 85 seats.
The PTI leader maintained that there were discrepancies between the Form 45 and Form 47, proving that rigging in the elections had taken place.
In response to the ECP displaying the electoral documents on its website, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said the “tampered” forms uploaded were “not credible” and the whole world had seen how much “chaos” the commission had caused.
He added that for many days, a “drama was unfolding” with Forms 45 and Forms 47.
“We knew that according to Forms 45, we have won 183 constituencies.” The PTI leader regretted that after 26 days, the commission had uploaded “tampered” Forms 45 to its website.
Addressing a large crowd at the Karachi Press Club recently, Sheikh flanked by Khurram Sher Zaman and other PTI leaders, said their Form-45s were an “undeniable proof” of their victory as he blamed the returning officers (ROs) for changing them illegally.
The PTI leader said that the party’s electoral symbol -- the cricket bat -- was snatched from it.
He was referring to the Supreme Court's order that upheld the ECP's decision to strip the party of its electoral symbol.
""The party's candidates were then allotted strange symbols, and cellular and internet services were also shut down on the polling day, but even then the people came out in huge numbers and voted for the PTI,"" he added.
Speaking on the occasion, Zaman took a jibe at Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, saying that the PPP chairman only showed the Form 45 of his Larkana seat.

5,Maulana to rev up anti-rigging crusade,JUI-F chief is expected to address a lawyers' convention today," 
The JUI-F, unyielding in its refusal to join forces with its former allies in the government, showed no intentions of relenting in its accusations of election rigging, escalating its challenge to the legitimacy of the recently elected parliament.
The emir of the politico-religious party, Maulana Fazlur Rahman, arrived in Lahore on Tuesday night for a two-day visit, signalling a strategic move in his protest against the electoral process.
Accompanied by central spokesperson Muhammad Aslam Ghori and Tariq Khan Baloch, JUI-F Punjab spokesperson Hafiz Ghazanfar Aziz announced Maulana Fazlur Rahman's schedule for the two-day visit.
The JUI-F chief is expected to address a lawyers' convention on Wednesday (today), with various party leaders and renowned lawyers slated to speak at the event.
Furthermore, Maulana Fazlur Rahman will attend a dinner hosted for the newly elected MNAs and MPAs.
On March 7 (Thursday), he is scheduled to address a party gathering, shedding light on the future course of action.
Hafiz Ghazanfar Aziz affirmed that all arrangements for Maulana Fazlur Rahman's visit to Lahore have been finalized, setting the stage for a series of impactful engagements.
The JUI-F chief has firmly ruled out joining the treasury benches on numerous occasions, opting instead to be a part of the opposition in the parliament. He has also hinted at the launch of a ""countrywide protest campaign"" against the perceived election irregularities.
Reiterating his stance on the February 8 elections, Maulana Fazlur Rahman has accused the establishment of orchestrating the ""stealing and managing"" of the people's mandate in Pakistan.
He has claimed that the people were once again betrayed in 2024, similar to the events of 2018.
