0,Blame game on Rashid’s ECL listing,"Court grills MoI officials for submitting ‘false’ report, summons secretary, SO","The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Tuesday categorically denied getting the name of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed included in the Exit Control List (ECL).
The denial came during a hearing at the Lahore High Court (LHC)’s Rawalpindi bench in which the Ministry of Interior (MoI) submitted a report that the name was included in the ECL on the recommendation of the premier accountability watchdog.
The court rejected the ministry’s report and issued a notice to the federal interior secretary and the relevant section officer and summoned them on Wednesday (today).
At the outset of the hearing, the NAB team and the prosecutor, in its report, pleaded that the Bureau neither made any recommendation to the federal government to include the name of the Awami Muslim League (AML) chief in the ECL nor wrote any letter in this regard. Even, Rashid wasn’t involved in the £190 million Al-Qadir University case and wanted in any NAB case, the report added.
The MoI, in its report submitted following the LHC’s notice during the last hearing, had claimed that Rashid’s name was included in the ECL on the NAB’s recommendation.
The division bench of the LHC, comprising Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan and Justice Mirza Waqas Rauf, expressed strong displeasure over the submission of the alleged false report.
In his petition, Rashid had pleaded that he used to perform Umrah every year in Ramazan, and this time his name had been put in the ECL as a ‘revenge’.
Advocate Sardar Abdul Raaziq informed the court that the indictment had been imposed in the £190 million reference case and that Rashid's name wasn’t included in the list of accused.

1,Rs1.2b sought for education projects,Directorate of colleges proposes projects to address admission issues in Rawalpindi,"In response to the pressing issue of admissions in colleges, the Rawalpindi Directorate of Colleges has formally requested permission and financial support for new projects.
The move aims to accommodate four-year BS programmes in four newly proposed colleges and two upgraded colleges within the district.
Substantial funding of Rs1.2 billion has been sought for the crucial projects, which have already received approval in the annual development program (ADP) for 2023-24. However, the execution of the project faced a setback when the caretaker government, now defunct, suspended the allocated funds in August 2023.
The proposed construction cost for Government Associate Boys College Kuntrila Gujar Khan is Rs300 million, Government Associate Girls College Rakh Sarkar Rawalpindi Rs200 million, Government Associate Boys College Karor Kotli Sattian Rs200 million, and Government Associate Girls College Murree Rs200 million.
Additionally, the cost of the new BS block in upgraded colleges, including Government Associate College Kallar Syedan, is estimated at Rs180 million, while Government Associate Girls College Gujar Khan is also allocated Rs180 million.
To expedite the process, urgent permission has been sought from the Punjab Higher Education Commission. The envisioned timeline for the completion of the new BS block construction is set at 120 days, aligning with plans to commence new admissions in the upcoming August-September session.
Director of Colleges Sher Ahmad Satti emphasised that the city of Rawalpindi itself does not suffer from a shortage of colleges. Instead, the focus is on those tehsils within the district currently facing a deficit in educational institutions.
The plan is not only to increase the number of colleges in these tehsils but also to enhance the capacity for new student admissions in the upcoming academic year. This strategic move aims to address the existing crisis in admissions, providing educational opportunities to a larger population within the district.

3,"ADB, UNICEF to work on water project",Official says new partnership will benefit up to 1.5 million people,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) signed a Letter of Understanding (LOU) on Tuesday to collaborate on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and solid waste management interventions under an ADB-funded project in Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur.
ADB Country Director for Pakistan, Yong Ye, and UNICEF’s Representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil signed the agreement at UNICEF’s Pakistan office in Islamabad.
“ADB and UNICEF are joining forces and renewing our shared commitment to strengthen policy, legislative framework, and institutional capacity in municipal service delivery, this time to improve the quality, coverage, and reliability of urban services under the Developing Resilient Environments and Advancing Municipal Services (DREAMS) Project,” said Yong Ye. “The collaboration will enable us to support the government’s efforts to address water supply and solid waste management challenges in these two important and rapidly growing cities.”
Under the new partnership, ADB and UNICEF will collaborate to support inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban infrastructure and services in Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur through public awareness and communication campaigns that will improve behaviours and practices related to water, sanitation, and solid waste management.
The understanding reached between ADB and UNICEF Pakistan offices will help promote sustainable, inclusive, and low-carbon municipal services that will benefit up to 1.5 million urban dwellers in the two cities of Punjab, the most populous province of the country.
“Signing of this agreement further strengthens the existing collaboration between ADB and UNICEF in Pakistan,” said Fadil. “Both organisations are committed to leveraging collective expertise and knowledge to help increase equitable access to water, sanitation and hygiene services and to reduce the vulnerability of citizens, especially children and women, to growing climate change and environmental degradation.”
The close synergies between ADB’s DREAMS project and UNICEF's WASH programme present a significant opportunity to enhance the impact of the programmes, ultimately leading to positive outcomes in water, sanitation, and hygiene that will benefit communities. The agreement will also pave the way for collaboration in future phases of the DREAMS project and other projects in Pakistan.
