2,Couple detained for ‘killing housemaid’,"Suspect had fled, leaving the girl dead at home","Police arrested a couple for allegedly torturing and killing a maid. District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Faisal Kamran addressed a press conference on Tuesday and said that the accused, Jawad Bhatti, had employed Aisha Bibi two months ago as a housemaid. 
The accused and his wife allegedly tortured the girl before fleeing the house, leaving the girl’s body at home. She succumbed to her injuries at the scene. The parents of the deceased girl informed police, who registered a case and launched an investigation after registering a case. 
DPO Kamran added that special teams were formed under SP Investigation to arrest the accused. The teams conducted raids in various districts and took them into custody. In February of this year, a young housemaid was allegedly beaten to death in Neemat Colony on Saturday. Police acted quickly, arrested the nominated accused and registered a case. Meanwhile, Chairperson of the Child Protection and Welfare Buereau Sarah Ahmed dispatched a team to the housemaid’s employers’ residence after learning of the incident.
Four months ago, 12-year-old Ayesha was hired by school teachers Fazlur Rahman, Sunila Tufail, and Raheela Tufail as domestic help at a wage of Rs12,000.
The victim was allegedly tortured by Fazlur Rahman, Sunila Tufail and Raheela. She was fine when her mother visited her a month ago, but the accused allegedly abused Ayesha after she left.
The victim’s head, hands, arms and legs all bore marks of physical abuse. Ayesha was allegedly tortured on Friday night as well, which led to serious deterioration of her health. She was taken to Civil Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.
Upon learning about the violent incident, police officers from SP Madina Town, ASP People’s Colony and SHO Madina Town Umar Sarfraz Waraich arrived at the scene.
Police shifted the body to hospital for a post-mortem examination, arrested Fazlur Rehman, Sunila Tufail and Raheela Tufail and started the investigation process by registering case no 649/24 Crime 302/34 PPC against the three accused upon the statement of Murtaza, the father of the murdered girl.
Marks of torture were found on the body upon examination. The postmortem report will clarify the cause of death. The arrested accused claimed that they did not torture the house maid and that the marks on her body were caused by allergies. After taking notice of the situation, City Police Officer Captain (Rtd) Muhammad Ali Zia ordered SP Medina Town to submit a thorough report about the incident.
However, CPWB Chairperson Sarah Ahmad took notice of Ayesha’s death and issued instructions to her team to contact the relatives of the deceased, stating that the Bureau will do its part to hold Ayesha’s killers accountable and offer the family all assistance possible.
Ahmad further stated that the bureau will extend complete legal assistance to the family of the deceased domestic worker. “We share the grief of the bereaved family over this incident,” she said. With additional input from APP

6,AI to be used to streamline traffic,"CM points out spots for encroachment removal, road redesign","Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has called for the use of artificial intelligence for effective enforcement of traffic rules.
Chairing a meeting on streamlining the flow of traffic in Lahore, she issued directives to remove temporary encroachments from 31 places in the city. However, she directed the officials concerned not to remove carts of poor vendors from the roads, saying a line should be drawn to allocate space from them.
She also ordered effective road engineering and designing at 82 locations and repair of roads at 28 places in Lahore to improve the flow of traffic. The chief minister issued directives to install ‘tyre killers’ at 88 spots in the city to prevent violation of one-way traffic.
She also called for the installation of digital screens to display warning messages in case of traffic jam on the roads. Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Ammara Athar gave a detailed briefing to the chief minister on a traffic management programme. She said that in the first phase, an e-challan service would be introduced, using the Safe City Authority surveillance cameras for not wearing helmets on motorbikes and seat belts in vehicles. 
In the second phase, issuance of e-challans will be started on the basis of monitoring through the cameras of violations of 24 traffic rules.
The chief minister directed the authorities concerned to be strict in enforcing the traffic rules, stressing that playing with the lives of innocent people could not be allowed. “Those who endanger people’s lives cannot be spared because violation of traffic rules is not encouraged in a civilised society,” she added.

Former senator Pervaiz Rashid, Members of Punjab Assembly Marriyum Aurangzeb and Sania Ashiq, the IG of police, CCPO, commissioner, CPO and DC of Lahore, chief engineers of LDA and TEPA and other relevant officers attended the meeting.
Meanwhile, the traffic police launched a renewed crackdown against motorcyclists travelling without helmets.
The police claimed that more than 90 per cent motorcyclists in the provincial capital had begun wearing helmets during the past year.
To ensure compliance, traffic wardens will take strict action against violators besides imposing fines. 
CTO Ammara Athar stated that the helmet enforcement campaign had shown significantly positive results with a noticeable decrease in cases of head injury reported in hospitals.
An order was issued to launch the crackdown on motorcyclists without helmets on all major roads in the city, including The Mall, Canal Road and Jail Road.
The CTO said the traffic officers had penalised over 40,000 motorcyclists travelling without helmets during the past two months, which had helped in visible decrease in the number of helmet-less riders in the city.
Housing plan
Chairing another meeting, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz vowed to fulfill a promise of providing homes to low-income people.
Under an ‘Apni Chhat…Apna Ghar’ programme, more than 3000 housing units will be built for low-income people in every district of Punjab. The houses will be provided to homeless people of Punjab with low monthly income, the CM stated.
She called for a comprehensive plan to complete the construction of 100,000 houses, and directed the authorities concerned to keep the down payment and monthly installments within the minimum possible limits.

7,Police under fire amidst gang bloodshed in Lahore,Allegations of corruption cast shadow on law enforcement,"The Punjab Police is facing criticism as the provincial capital continues to grapple with ongoing bloodshed stemming from age-old rivalries and reported gang warfare. Allegations of police complicity in exacerbating these conflicts have raised serious concerns about the force's ability to address such entrenched issues.
At the heart of the matter are the figures known as ""deraydar"" and ""dushmandar,"" who play a central role in perpetuating violence in the city.
These individuals serve as lucrative assets for the police, who exploit their influence for financial gain. Reports suggest that officers receive bribes from both complainants and accused parties, effectively profiting from the turmoil.
According to sources, many officers are on the payroll of influential “deraydar” and “dushmandar”, receiving illicit payments in addition to their official salaries.
This dual allegiance compromises the integrity of the police force and undermines public trust in law enforcement.
Furthermore, senior police officers are allegedly involved in shady property deals, using their connections with these powerful figures to further their own interests.
This collusion extends beyond law enforcement, encompassing various sectors of society and perpetuating a culture of corruption.
The recent murder of Ameer Balaj Tipu, a young man killed during a wedding ceremony in Chung due to a decades-old enmity, has reignited the debate surrounding the police's role in addressing longstanding feuds among prominent Lahore families.
Sultan Mehmood alias Bachu Pehalwan, the grandfather of Ameer Balaj Tipu, holds the Punjab Police responsible for perpetuating the cycle of violence, citing a lack of justice following previous incidents.
Bachu alleges that senior police officers, including former SSP Chaudhry Shafqat, have colluded with suspects accused of orchestrating attacks on his family.
He claims that bribes were paid to fabricate false FIRs, shielding the assailants from accountability.
Journalists argue that reconciliation efforts between rival factions are often undermined by vested interests seeking to exploit the ongoing hostilities.
Israr Butt, a senior political figure in Lahore, emphasises the role of gossip and misinformation in fuelling these rivalries, perpetuating a cycle of violence and retribution.
Ameer Balaj Tipu, a promising young man with aspirations for peace, tragically lost his life before realising his dreams of reconciliation. His untimely death serves as a poignant reminder of the urgent need for intervention to end these conflicts.

8,Imran greenlights K-P cabinet formation,CM Gandapur says decision to reconcile with the establishment rests solely with the PTI founder,"Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has given his seal of approval to the selection of members for the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) cabinet. Sources within PTI disclosed to The Express Tribune that Khan stressed the significance of ensuring representation from all districts, including Peshawar, in the cabinet. 
He personally endorsed seven names for cabinet positions, while the remaining seats will be filled at the discretion of the chief minister. 
Initially, the cabinet is set to comprise 10 ministers, three advisors, and three special assistants, aiming to ensure a diverse and inclusive representation of the province’s interests.
This decision was made during a meeting between Imran Khan and Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, which took place at Adiala prison.
Sources said that Taimur Saleem Jharga is likely to be given the portfolio of finance minister.

Similarly, Meena Khan, Fazal Khan, Syed Qasim Ali Shah, Khaleequr Rehman and Zahir Shah Toru would also be made part of the cabinet. 
In this meeting, Khan underscored the urgent need for reforms in critical sectors such as education, police, health, and the revitalization of the Billion Tree Tsunami project. 
Highlighting the pressing issue of climate change, Khan directed Gandapur to expedite the reactivation of the Billion Tree Tsunami project, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to combat environmental challenges.
On the other hand the K-P CM emphasized that both the establishment and institutions belong to the people, but the decision regarding reconciliation with the establishment rests solely with Imran Khan. 
Khan’s unique position as the only prime minister to be ousted through a no-confidence motion in Pakistan’s history underscores the gravity of his role in shaping the party’s approach to reconciliation.
Maintaining a steadfast stance against the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Gandapur asserted that PTI’s mandate was unlawfully seized through extensive electoral fraud. 
He vehemently stated, “We will not entertain any reconciliation with those who have illegitimately usurped our mandate. Our resolve is to establish a robust system that safeguards against future attempts to subvert the will of the people.”
The K-P chief minister affirmed that the provincial government is committed to maintaining a working relationship with the federal government for the collective benefit of all stakeholders. However, he emphasized that cooperation would not extend to condoning actions that undermine the democratic process.
“The federal government’s illegitimate acquisition of our party’s mandate cannot be overlooked, and we cannot engage in collaboration with those who have manipulated the electoral system,” he asserted.
He also demanded of the Supreme Court chief justice to form an inquiry commission to probe the May 9 riots. The riots led to a crackdown against PTI members across the country.
