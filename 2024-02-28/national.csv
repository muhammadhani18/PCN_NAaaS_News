0,Moody’s holds Pakistan’s credit rating,Bank of America upgrades bonds despite doubts over govt’s IMF dealings,"Moody’s Investors Service has left Pakistan’s long-term issuer rating unchanged at ‘Caa3’, suggesting the country is facing high credit risk, as doubts arise over the new government’s ability to swiftly negotiate a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme after the current one expires in April 2024.
The global rating agency maintained a ‘stable outlook’ on the credit rating.
In another development, Bank of America (BofA) has upgraded Pakistan’s global Eurobond to ‘overweight’ in hopes that international rating agencies would improve the country’s credit rating. However, this expectation proved untrue in the case of Moody’s latest periodic review. The investment bank also linked the future valuation of Pakistan’s international bonds with the acquisition of the next IMF loan programme (on time).
According to a local media outlet, Moody’s warned that it remains highly uncertain whether the newly elected government of Pakistan would be able “to quickly negotiate a new IMF programme soon after the ongoing programme expires in April.”
The agency has cast doubt over the new government’s ability in the wake of the likely formation of a weak government at the centre in the coming days. February 8’s inconclusive election results suggest a hung parliament is in the making in the country.
Moody’s found the elections “highly controversial.”
The rating agency said ""while Pakistan is likely to meet its external debt obligations for the fiscal year ending June 2024, there is limited visibility regarding the sovereign’s sources of financing to meet its very high external financing needs after the current IMF Stand-By Arrangement ends in April 2024.”
“The large amount of external financing required over the medium term, combined with Pakistan’s very low reserves position, imply material default risks if there are delays in funding from the IMF and other partners. Social pressures and weaknesses in governance may also raise challenges in meeting criteria for future IMF funding,” it said.
“Continued IMF engagement, including beyond the current programme, would help support additional financing from other multilateral and bilateral partners, which could reduce default risk if this is achieved urgently and without further raising social pressures,” said Moody’s.
The agency, however, said it would consider upgrading the country’s credit rating once it acquires the required external financing in the near future.
“This could come with a sustainable increase in foreign exchange reserves. A resumption of fiscal consolidation, including through implementing revenue-raising measures, pointing to a meaningful improvement in debt affordability would also be credit positive,” it said.

The rating would likely be downgraded “if Pakistan were to default on its debt obligations to private-sector creditors and the expected losses to creditors as a result of any restructuring were larger than consistent with a Caa3 rating.”
“There is high uncertainty around the newly elected government’s willingness and ability to quickly negotiate a new IMF programme soon after the current one expires in April,” as it believes the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) would form a coalition government in the centre.
“The forthcoming coalition government’s electoral mandate may not be sufficiently strong to pursue difficult reforms that will likely be required by a successor programme. Until a new programme is agreed to, Pakistan’s ability to secure loans from other bilateral and multilateral partners will be severely constrained,” it said.
According to the global media outlet Bloomberg, Bank of America (BofA) raised its recommendation for Pakistan dollar bonds to overweight from marketweight, citing falling political uncertainty after the elections and possible rating improvements.
“We upgrade Pakistan to overweight from marketweight with a fair value range of $70-75 in the longer end of the curve,” strategists led by Vladimir Osakovskiy wrote in a note.
“The election-related political uncertainty is falling, as remaining policy risks are largely the same as last year and have already been addressed once through the breakthrough with the IMF.”
“We initiate a trade buy Pakistan notes due in 2026 with a target of 83 stop loss of 69.” The bonds are trading at 77 currently. “The likely repayment of $1 billion ‘24s maturing in April will likely provide support to the whole curve, but mainly bring 25’ – 26’ into the spotlight of market attention, likely forcing further bull-steepening.”
“The longer end may benefit from likely progress with the new IMF programme, as the market may start to price in gradual rating improvements, as already hinted at by S&P.”
“We note remaining political tail risks as the market may closely monitor cabinet appointments, evaluating key members on their ability to deliver on IMF conditions,” wrote the bank.

2,Oil refining sector sees $1 billion investment boost,Cnergyico Pk takes first step as new govt policy prompts investments in industry,"Cnergyico Pk Limited, the country’s largest refiner, is eyeing more than $1 billion in investment following the introduction of a new government policy aimed at stimulating the industry.
Following its investment, Cnergyico plans to enhance its production of Euro-V compliant motor gasoline and high-speed diesel, simultaneously decreasing its furnace oil output in response to its declining and unpredictable demand.
Pakistan has faced several economic challenges in recent times, including political instability, soaring inflation, a weakening currency, and declining foreign exchange reserves. These factors have eroded investor confidence, making local and foreign investors hesitant to allocate capital for major projects.
In a move to counteract these trends, the government recently announced the Brownfield Oil Refinery Policy. This initiative, designed to stimulate investment in existing projects, follows the earlier introduction of the Greenfield Refinery Policy, which sought to draw foreign investment into the sector.
While foreign investors haven’t yet committed to building new facilities, the Brownfield policy has ignited interest among the five leading domestic refiners: Cnergyico, Attock Refinery Limited (ARL), Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL), National Refinery Limited (NRL), and Pak Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO).
Cnergyico has recently announced its plans to invest over $1 billion in the modernisation and expansion of its oil refining operations. The company’s oil refining complex, capable of processing up to 156,000 barrels of crude oil daily, constitutes approximately 37% of Pakistan’s total oil refining capacity. 
Talking to The Express Tribune, a Cnergyico spokesperson hailed the new policy, stating, “This will spearhead the revival of Pakistan’s oil refining industry, leading to a significant increase in production of environmentally friendly fuels, reduced reliance on imported fuels, substantial foreign exchange savings, job creation, and a boost in overall business activity.”

Read PRL launches $1.7b refinery upgrade project
Cnergyico is actively engaged in discussions with the government to address the delays in petroleum levy payments, a situation exacerbated by the challenging economic climate that has impacted the entire oil refining sector, alongside delays in receivables from government-controlled entities. The company’s outstanding receivables from these entities currently surpass the amount owed to the government for the petroleum levy.
“We are fully committed to resolving this matter at the earliest in accordance with the approved oil refining policy,” said the spokesperson.
In addition to Cnergyico, PRL also seeks to upgrade its plants and double its processing capacity to 100,000 barrels per day by spending $1.7 billion. PRL, a subsidiary of PSO, expects to complete the project by the end of 2028. Overall, the five oil refineries across Pakistan are poised to invest between $5 billion and $6 billion in modernising their facilities.
These upgrades could potentially double Pakistan’s petrol production and increase diesel output by 47%, while furnace oil might see a 78% drop. Such advancements could lead Pakistan to diesel self-sufficiency, curtailing the costly need for imports that burden the country’s finances.

3,Rupee comes under some pressure,Drops nominally to Rs279.28 vs dollar in inter-bank network,"The overweight Pakistani currency on Tuesday came under nominal selling pressure as it inched down to Rs279.28 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market apparently due to an uptick in demand for the greenback compared to its supply.
The currency had hit a four-month high a day ago, closing at Rs279.20 against the dollar. According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee decreased 0.02%, or Rs0.08, on a day-on-day basis.
The currency saw the nominal drop after having gained a net 10%, or Rs27.90, in the past five and a half months compared to the record low close at Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
According to the central bank’s latest monthly update, Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate (REER) – the value of rupee against a basket of currencies of foreign trading partners – appreciated to 101.70 in January 2024 from 98.3 in December 2023.
It indicated that the Pakistani rupee had become slightly overvalued at current levels and there was a room for some depreciation.
On the other hand, the rupee regained 0.08%, or Rs0.24, and closed at Rs282.04/$ in the open market, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP). The appreciation in retail trade and depreciation in inter-bank dealings slightly narrowed the disparity between currency values in the two markets to Rs2.76, or 0.99%, putting a brake on the widening of the difference in recent days.

The gap had widened to 1.10% (Rs3.08) until Monday, getting closer to the maximum limit of 1.25% (around Rs4) recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Market talk suggests that Pakistan’s political uncertainty has eased, but it still remains elevated, which makes the next IMF loan programme uncertain. If the country fails to get the loan package on time in March-April 2024, it will leave a negative impact on the rupee. Treasury firm Tresmark said on Saturday that the rupee had remained in the range of 279-280 to a dollar in the past 30 days.
“It is no surprise that senior officials have already started approaching the IMF for a new, larger package that will provide economic stability,” it said. It is evident that dollar liquidity in the market is ample with banks’ Nostros sufficiently funded.

4,Businesses sound alarm over surge in power prices,"Lament NEPRA’s unexpected hike will add Rs70b burden, threaten survival","Different business groups have shown their concern over a recent increase in the fuel adjustment price of electricity, which is Rs7.05 per unit, calling it an unexpected hike from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). This increase will put a burden of Rs70 billion on the people of Pakistan, they said.
They also said that apart from domestic consumers, the industrial sector, especially the export-oriented sector, will suffer a huge loss in terms of foreign exchange.
“Repeated hikes in power tariffs are hitting exports and local businesses alike. The government has increased electricity prices many times, and the majority of people have been sent bills many times more than their monthly income,” said Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industries (LCCI) President Kashif Anwar.
He said that electricity is the main input for industries. If such anti-industry measures are not avoided, the manufacturing sector will be completely destroyed, and the country will remain only a trading place.
“The cost of electricity in Pakistan is already very high compared to other countries in the region, and Pakistani products will be completely out of competition in the international market,” he said.
The country has already lost much of the global market to Bangladesh and India due to high production costs. More burden is being put on those customers who are paying their dues regularly and whose line losses are the least, Anwar said.
He added that the trend of theft will increase due to the increase in electricity prices. “The business community is unable to understand why, instead of controlling line losses and increasing the generation of cheap power through renewable resources, their problems are being compounded.”

The business community said that the power distribution companies’ (Discos’) losses and inefficiencies stood at Rs77 billion during July-December 2023-24 as compared to Rs62 billion in the same period of 2022-23, showing an addition of Rs15 billion in total circular debt stock. The total amount of losses and inefficiencies was Rs160 billion during FY2022-23.
Discos’ under-recoveries reached Rs149 billion during the first half of 2023-24 as compared to Rs62 billion during the corresponding period of 2022-23; however, their cumulative under-recoveries stood at Rs236 billion as of June 30, 2023.
“Policy makers sitting in Islamabad have failed to read the writing on the wall. ‘Out-of-the-box thinking’ is required to emerge from the economic crisis,” said Pakistan Business Forum Vice President Ahmad Jawad.
He warned that if energy prices are not slashed by approximately 43%, various industries may not survive as high input costs would lead to the loss of export markets, eventually triggering industrial closures.
“Pakistan, already reeling from skyrocketing inflation for the last three years, similarly, the international competitiveness of Pakistan’s textiles and apparel exports is being continuously eroded by ever-increasing energy prices that, on average, are over twice those of competing countries. One should understand that price hikes have made Pakistani exporters ‘uncompetitive’ in the export markets by a large margin,” said Jawad.

5,PSX retreats as political noise rises,"Benchmark KSE-100 index dips 86.83 points, settles at 63,219.10","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday came under selling pressure, sparked by political uncertainty owing to delay in calling the first National Assembly (NA) session after general elections in early February.
In the morning, trading commenced on a strong note on top of previous day’s gains. The market then took a dive but recovered swiftly and the KSE-100 index reached its intra-day high at 63,622 points at midday.
However, as the day progressed, the market began its downward spiral due to political noise and economic concerns, which caused a shift in investor sentiment.
Notably, worries over the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) conditions under a fresh loan programme, high inflation and a hike in gas prices contributed to the bearish sentiment. Consequently, the index touched the intra-day low at 63,055.64 points in the afternoon, erasing all the earlier gains.
The market was unable to regain the momentum in the absence of major positive triggers. Nevertheless, the index managed to close above the 63,000 mark with slight losses. “Stocks closed under pressure amid political uncertainty following president’s refusal to call the NA session,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Uncertainty about the IMF’s conditions for the proposed new loan, concerns over high inflation and hike in gas prices for industrial consumers played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.” At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded losses of 86.83 points, or 0.14%, and settled at 63,219.10.
Topline Securities observed in its report that the stock market wrapped up the trading day at 63,219 with a dip of 87 points. “Throughout the session, the index experienced a mixed pattern, hitting a high of 63,622 and low of 63,055,” it said.
The decline in the index was influenced by Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDC), Service Industries, United Bank, Pakistan Petroleum and Pakistan State Oil, which collectively lost 207 points, Topline added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) remarked that the “63k-64k congestion zone was held firm with intra-day gains limited to 63,622”.

TRG Pakistan (+5.03%), Mari Petroleum (+1.99%) and Kot Addu Power Company (+7.5%) were the biggest contributors to the gains, it said, adding that tech names remained a hot bet but the market needed to clear the 64,000 mark to indicate broader participation.
During the day, OGDC (-3.15%) announced 1HFY24 earnings per share of Rs28.67, up 30% year-on-year, and 2QFY24 earnings per share of Rs17.27, up 78% year-on-year, the highest on record, AHL said.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal said technically the market reached the resistance level of 63,200 while major results had already been announced.
“Profit-taking has been witnessed in the market. Going forward, profit realisation is recommended and investors are advised to sell on strength,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 409.96 million shares against Monday’s tally of 452.9 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs14.7 billion.
Shares of 355 companies were traded. Of these, 111 stocks closed higher, 223 dropped and 21 remained unchanged.
The Bank of Punjab was the volume leader with trading in 47.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.02 to close at Rs6.27. It was followed by K-Electric with 40.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.08 to close at Rs4.52 and WorldCall Telecom with 25.8 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs1.27.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs198.9 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,Govt set to hike petrol prices by over Rs3/litre,HSD rates hold steady as oil market volatility continues,"The caretaker government is likely to increase the prices of petrol by over Rs3 per litre, effective from March 1, 2024. However, it may maintain the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) due to a marginal increase in its price.
The increase in the price of high-speed diesel has been worked out at Rs0.99 per litre and kerosene oil at Rs0.82 per litre. The price of light diesel oil (LDO) has been estimated to come down by Rs0.77 per litre.
Due to expected exchange rate adjustment, the price of petrol may go up to Rs2.94 per litre and diesel to Rs0.49 per litre. The oil price revisions are based on a higher premium, exchange rate adjustment, and the current petroleum levy and general sales tax (GST) rate on petroleum products. An increase in the price of HSD may have an inflationary impact as it is usually used in the transportation sector.

The import premium on petrol is estimated at $10.48 per barrel, whereas the premium on high-speed diesel is estimated at $6.50 per barrel. The government is charging Rs60 per litre petroleum levy on both high-speed diesel and petrol.
The inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) is Rs7.52 per litre on petrol and Rs3.92 per litre on high-speed diesel. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has yet to work out the recommended fuel prices for the first half of March. The authority will calculate the price of petroleum keeping in view monthly tax targets and the estimated fuel consumption and supply cost of Pakistan State Oil (PSO).
The sale of total petroleum products in Pakistan clocked in at 1.38 million tonnes in January, a decline of 4% year-on-year compared to 1.44 million in the same period of the previous year. The decline comes on the back of lower petrol and diesel sales.

7,Daraz announces layoffs in memo,"Alibaba’s South Asian e-commerce giant says will adopt more streamlined, agile structure","Alibaba-owned e-commerce platform Daraz Group has announced layoffs across the group to “adopt a more streamlined and agile structure”, acting Chief Executive Officer James Dong said on Tuesday in an internal memo to employees reviewed by Reuters.
The memo did not mention the number of people affected by the layoff. Daraz declined to comment on the percentage or absolute number of employees impacted across its operations in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.
“Reluctantly, we will bid farewell to many valued members of the Daraz family,” the memo to staff said.
Last year, Daraz told Reuters it employed 3,000 employees across its geographies, prior to the e-commerce marketplace cutting its workforce by 11% due to difficult market conditions, the Ukraine crisis, supply chain disruptions, soaring inflation, higher taxes and fewer government subsidies, among other reasons.
“Despite our efforts to explore different solutions, our cost structure continues to fall short of our financial targets. Facing unprecedented challenges in the market, we must take swift action to ensure our company’s long-term sustainability and continued growth,” Dong was quoted as saying.

He added that the group plans to focus on proactively improving consumer experience by diversifying offerings of value-for-money products, expanding product categories and enhancing operational efficiency of sellers on its platform.
In January, the e-commerce group appointed James Dong as acting CEO, replacing outgoing CEO Bjarke Mikkelsen.
Pakistan and Bangladesh are the group’s biggest markets, outgoing CEO Mikkelsen said last year.
Founded in 2012 in Pakistan as an online fashion retailer, Daraz was later acquired by Chinese internet giant Alibaba, in 2018.
The business covers four key areas – e-commerce, logistics, payment infrastructure and financial services. It has more than 30 million shoppers, 200,000 active sellers and over 100,000 brands, the company told Reuters.

8,Businessmen decry hike in terminal charges,"Stress shipping lines, container terminals be put under strong regulatory body","Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice President (SVP) Saquib Fayyaz Magoon has said that the business, trade and industrial community is in a state of shock and disbelief at a threefold increase in container terminal charges.
The terminal fee has gone up since Karachi Gateway Terminal Limited (KGTL) took over the management of the container terminal at Karachi Port’s East Wharf. Previously, the charges were Rs150 per tonne but now they have been raised to Rs480 per tonne, he said, according to a statement released by the FPCCI on Tuesday.
He demanded that KGTL rationalise the container terminal rates with immediate effect and any future increase should be announced two to three months in advance. Additionally, they should not act unilaterally without engaging in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.
The FPCCI SVP stressed that shipping lines and container terminals needed to be brought under a strong and effective regulatory authority to put an end to the exploitation of importers and exporters.
“Trade is the backbone of any economy and traders cannot be left at the mercy of container terminals,” he added.

KGTL CEO Khurram Aziz Khan visited the FPCCI head office in Karachi to interact and get feedback of the business community on their services and charges at Karachi Port. He offered to constitute a high-profile committee with FPCCI’s nominees to look into the grievances, complaints, issues and feedback of traders from the apex platform.
“FPCCI is the right place to engage with the trading community,” he said and elaborated on KGTL’s expansion plans for infrastructure development at their container terminal.
“We are going to spend $75 million in the next two years and another $100 million in a time span of five years in order to bring world-class, cutting-edge and efficient infrastructure, machinery and technologies to Karachi Port,” he said.
He pointed out that KGTL had signed an agreement with Karachi Port Trust, which comes under the Ministry of Maritime Affairs. “Therefore, KGTL comes under the legal jurisdiction of Pakistan.”

9,DISCOs: govt to adopt Turkish model,"Decides to outsource management to slash losses, draw investment","Pakistan has decided to follow the Turkish model through outsourcing the management of power distribution companies (DISCOs) in an attempt to reduce losses, bring efficiency and attract investment.
To adopt the Turkish model, the government of Pakistan has agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it will engage a transaction adviser for long-term concessions by the end of April 2024. The World Bank has offered a grant-based technical assistance and risk guarantee instruments, which give greater confidence to the prospective private concession holders and their lenders. The International Finance Corporation has expressed interest in providing transaction advisory services.
Sources revealed that policymakers were informed in a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) that a long-term concession model had delivered the benefits of private sector participation in Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Uganda and other countries. Policymakers noted that under such concessions, Turkey’s 20 DISCOs attracted a much larger private sector investment than under the public sector, ensured much better service quality for consumers and reduced losses by one-third in a decade.
The meeting was informed that Turkey secured the jobs of most of the staff of DISCOs for the first five years along with only 3-5% long-term increase in tariffs.
Pakistan’s policymakers noted that a similar experience was required to be followed in Pakistan whereby the government would agree with concession holders on a gradual reduction in liabilities through loss reduction without a significant increase in tariffs.
They said that DISCOs would then secure a much better value from privatisation. There was unanimity of views among the policymakers that the handing over of DISCOs to provincial governments was unlikely to result in the required strategic shift.
Furthermore, provincial authorities had laid a number of conditions for taking over the ownership of DISCOs, which may not be supportive of efforts to improve their operational performance and may delay the process further.
There was consensus that privatisation was the best solution. However, the policymakers stated that the sale of government assets had often come under legal and political pressure on account of valuation of assets. Any sale of assets at throwaway prices had the potential to derail the entire process.

Read Revamping DISCOs
In addition, legacy issues about the ownership of assets (DISCOs vs Wapda) still existed and had been a major hurdle in the way of privatisation.
The Power Division was of the view that the concession model would bring the desired results. It was proposed that initially two smaller DISCOs, the better-performing Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) and the poor-performing Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco), may be earmarked. The Power Division told the meeting that the power sector’s longstanding difficulties stemmed primarily from the operational performance of 10 DISCOs.
The key challenges faced by DISCOs included poor governance and inadequate investment. Therefore, they were placed on the active privatisation list but the process could not move forward.
During the tenure of the previous government, a committee was constituted for the transfer of DISCOs to provinces. The committee submitted its report to the then prime minister, who gave the directive that the summary may be placed before the new cabinet.
During a meeting of the executive committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), held on September 26-27, 2023, the minister of privatisation called for taking an appropriate course for transferring the management of DISCOs to the private sector.
The SIFC apex committee, during a meeting on October 4, 2023, agreed with the proposal and decided that the recommendation of the privatisation minister about private sector participation in the management of DISCOs, including management contracts/ outsourcing, should be approved.
A summary will be moved to the cabinet to revive its earlier decision on private sector participation and withdraw the proposal of “provincialisation”.
It was observed that the concession model/ outsourcing would be discussed and a firm proposal would be presented by the energy minister and the privatisation minister in the next CCOP huddle.
The Power Division revealed that to come up with a workable solution to introduce a private sector-oriented culture of governance and management, modern expertise, information and communication technology and attract adequate investment in DISCOs, extensive consultations were held with the relevant entities and international financial institutions to develop a model for private sector participation in line with Pakistan’s ground realities.
The CCOP observed that the case relating to private sector participation in the operation of DISCOs through long-term concession contracts fell within the domain of the Privatisation Commission rather than the Power Division. Therefore, the matter should be dealt with by the Privatisation Commission.
