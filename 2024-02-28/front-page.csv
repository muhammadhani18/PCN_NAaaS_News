• ECP takes up parties’ challenges before original SIC plea, proceedings to continue today
• PTI’s Gohar says assembly sessions without allocation of seats will be ‘illegal’
ISLAMABAD: With only one day left before the first session of the National Assembly is convened, the Election Com­m­ission of Pakistan (ECP) has yet to clear the air over the allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), following a PTI-SIC ‘merger’ for this very purpose.
The issue became further complicated on Tues­day after at least three political parties, the PPP, PML-N, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakis­tan (MQM-P), approached the commission to lay claim to the seats dem­a­nded by SIC in parliament.
During a hearing on a set of petitions filed against the proposed allocation of seats to the SIC as demanded by the PTI, it emerged that the PML-N, PPP, and the MQM-P opposed the distribution of the remaining reserved seats to the SIC, saying it could not be called a parliamentary party.
Similarly, they argued that the SIC failed to submit a list of candidates for the reserved seats in time, like other political parties.
 
 

Interestingly, a five-member bench headed by Chief Election Commi­ssioner Sikandar Sultan Raja did not take up the SIC’s plea, filed last week, seeking the allocation of reserved seats.
The bench, however, took up the petitions filed against the SIC application — two of these applications were added to the cause list on Monday night. The SIC application has been clubbed together with the other parties’ pleas and the ECP will take these up today (Wednesday).
Rival claims
At the outset of the hearing, PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar wondered who were the applicants and why they were attending the hearing. He said that the SIC and PTI-backed independents had approached the ECP to claim their reserved seats and if the political parties wanted to take these seats away, then they should openly say so.
The MQM-P, PPP and the PML-N should come forward as political parties and claim the seats, he said. An ECP member res­ponded that MQM leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui had appeared before the Election Commission and said that the seats not be given to the SIC.
PPP leader Farooq H. Naek also interrupted and said he was representing a political party as well. He said it was the commission’s prerogative to decide who should be given the reser­ved seats and argued that it should be established first whether the SIC qualified for these seats or not.
PML-N’s Azam Nazeer
Tarar argued that the SIC had no right to claim the reserved seats as “the SIC did not provide its list of candidates for reserved seats in time”. According to the PML-N leader, if the SIC did not win a single seat in the general elections, then how can it be given reserved seats after being joined by some independents?
The PML-N lawyer claimed the SIC was not a parliamentary party and, therefore, it could not be given reserved seats. At this, CEC Raja asked him to leave that matter to the ECP to decide.
The ECP also issued notices to the Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the JUI-F, Aleem Khan of the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party, Pir Sibghatullah Shah of the Grand Democratic Alliance, and Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain of PML-Q after it was proposed that all parliamentary parties should be heard.
‘No SIC seats’
Later, talking to reporters outside the ECP building, Azam Nazeer Tarar lambasted the SIC for expecting reserved seats in the National Assembly, calling it an illogical stance.
“This is a party that did not even contest elections, didn’t win a single seat, and they are saying they have the right to reserved seats because a bunch of independent candidates joined them,” he said.
PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali, on the other hand, said that an assembly session could not be called without first notifying the reserved seats.
 






“The Punjab Assembly session was called in an illegal manner. The Sindh Assembly session was carried out in an illegal manner. If the National Assembly session is called that will also be illegal because the assemblies should be convened after all the members of the House are notified,” he made it clear.
He urged the ECP to notify the reserved seats for the Sunni Ittehad Council. He said that the people have given their mandate, and expressed hopes that the ECP would listen to “what the people voted for on Feb 8”. “These reserved seats belong to SIC, no other political party can lay claim to them,” Barrister Gohar added.

1,Coalition to hammer out govt formation issues today,"Mustafa Kamal owns statement claiming PPP wants to form govt ""without MQM-P"".","ISLAMABAD: PML-N Presi­d­ent Shehbaz Sharif has convened a meeting of his party’s allies in the Centre to put the final touches to the formation of a new coalition government, on Wednesday.
In light of their recent agreement to support each other in the federal government, the PPP and PML-N were expected to decide the names of their candidates for the coveted slots of speaker and deputy speaker of the national and Balochistan assemblies by late Tuesday night. However, until the filing of this report, no decision had been announced in this regard.
The PML-N is also holding a meeting of its parliamentary party today (Wednesday), which will be co-chaired by the party’s supremo Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shehbaz.
 
 

“The PML-N president called a meeting of allied parties tomorrow at Punjab House in which formation of the new government will be discussed,” PML-N Senator Ishaq Dar said in a press talk on Tuesday.

He said that according to their agreement, the PPP and the PML-N would field their joint candidates for the offices of speaker and deputy speaker of the national and Balochistan assemblies. He said both parties were committed to abiding by their deal to support each other in the “functioning of the next government”.
Accompanied by PML-N and PPP coordination committee me­m­bers, Mr Dar told the media that a meeting of the PML-N and PPP coordination committee members decided the future alignment. He said his party had a clear road map on how to pull the country out of prevailing economic and political crises.

Mr Dar said his party had its doors open for reconciliation even with the PTI. “We can make reconciliation with the PTI, though May 9 incidents made it difficult,” he added.
While JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman addressing a presser reiterated rigging allegations, the PML-N leader said his party had been ready to go with JUI-F not only in Balochistan but also in the Centre.
Under the agreement, the PPP has announced its support to the PML-N so that the latter could form its government, with Shehbaz Sharif tipped to be the next prime minister.
Of the total 265 general seats in the NA, the PML-N has bagged 75 seats, while the PPP secured 54. Although PTI-backed independent candidates got the highest number of seats, i.e. 93, they did not opt for alliance with either of the two mainstream parties. A total of 169 NA seats is re­quired to form a government.
Kamal’s audio leak
Meanwhile, MQM-P leader Syed Mustafa Kamal said in a video message that “a spy of MQM-London” had released an audio tape in which he can be heard speaking at a meeting of the party’s Rabita Commi­ttee.
 






Confirming the contents of the audio, he said he was informing the committee that the PPP had told the PML-N that after their agreement to form the government, they did not require MQM-P’s help to form the government.
He said that he had apprised the meeting about PPP’s claim that MQM was “given a fake mandate”.

The couple, however, pleaded not guilty. 
Judge Nasir Javed Rana of the accountability court also summoned five witnesses on March 6 for testimony. 
The counsel for Mr Khan objected to the indi­ctment, saying that under the law, the charge could only be framed a week after the distribution of copies of challan/reference among the suspects.
He further objected that more than 50 documents provided to the defence counsel were not even readable. 
He requested the court to adjourn the hearing for seven days. The counsel pointed out that he has already filed an application seeking provision of the documents.
Sardar Muzaffar Khan Abbasi, the NAB deputy prosecutor general, requ­ested the court to indict Mr Khan and his spouse and suggested that the relevant record would be provided to the defence counsel at the time of recording of statements of the prosecution witnesses.

3,PTI announces countrywide street protests against ‘rigging’,"Party leaders demand CJP’s intervention, allege victories in Balochistan changed to defeats overnight; Imran endorses Alvi’s refusal to call NA session.","• Party leaders demand CJP’s intervention, allege victories in Balochistan changed to defeats overnight
• Imran endorses Alvi’s refusal to call NA session
• Amir Dogar nominated for NA speaker slot
ISLAMABAD: The PTI has decided to take to the streets, again, to protest against the alleged theft of its mandate, urging all democratic forces to join hands with the former ruling party to “strengthen democracy” in the country.
This was announced by PTI leader and MNA-elect Sher Afzal Marwat during a press conference in Islamabad, alongside other senior party leaders, as well as PTI-backed candidates from Balochistan. Bes­i­des the protest drive, the presser focused on ‘massive rigging’ in Balochis­tan, which allegedly turned the victories of the PTI candidates into defeats overnight.
 






Mr Marwat said the PTI would organise a countrywide peaceful protest on March 2 on the directives of PTI founder Imran Khan and he had been tasked with leading a demonstration in Islamabad on Saturday morning. He said that if the nation did not raise its voice against the “mega polls theft”, then democracy would never flourish in Pakistan.
Speaking about the situation in Balochistan, the PTI leader said that the issue of election rigging in Balochistan was presented before the ECP but that proved an exercise in futility.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI leader
Ali Mohammad Khan alleged that the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan “were breached through large-scale rigging” across the country, especially in Balochistan. He stressed that the public should be allowed to exercise its right to choose a government.
 






He assured that the PTI was not against any political party or an institution but they wanted that the public mandate must be respected.
“It is not a personal fight; it is a matter of people’s mandate. If we want to save democracy in Pakistan, then give it [government] to the ones who have the mandate,” he added.
“We request the chief justice of Pakistan to launch a probe into the allegations of the Rawalpindi commissioner regarding the massive poll theft.”
Polls in Balochistan
PTI leader Salar Khan Kakar alleged that seats were sold to “contractors, smugglers and apolitical figures” in Balochistan allegedly through massive rigging.
According to Mr Kakar, he had secured a clear victory as per Form-45 but a PML-N candidate who was in the eighth position was declared triumphant “fraudulently”. He claimed that he was denied entry into the RO’s office despite waiting outside the office all night.
PTI’s candidate for PB-41 in Quetta, Ghafar Kakar alleged he was warned of consequences through a letter if he did not halt the election campaign. He said he campaigned vigorously in the lead-up to polls, but his victory was snatched.
Mr Kakar claimed that he was kicked out of the RO office by the paramilitary personnel who allegedly manipulated election results to declare him a runner-up. Haji Noor Khan Khalji, who contested the PB-39 seat from Quetta, said that people came out in huge numbers to vote for Imran Khan.
“We were contacted at night and were asked that if we would stay with Imran Khan, they would not let us win,” he alleged. He said that he was winning with a clear margin on February 8 but “they” defeated him on February 9 by manipulating election results.
PTI’s candidate for NA-253, Saddam Tarin, stated PTI-backed candidates had Form-45, which clearly showed their victory in various constituencies, including NA-253.
He alleged that PTI’s mandate was stolen at midnight. However, the PTI candidate made it clear that “they would not surrender and were ready to render any sacrifice to get the stolen public mandate back”.
PTI’s candidate for NA-252, Alam Khan said that he had won the seat with a margin of 30,000 votes as per Form 45 but after three days, he was handed defeat by 2,000 votes on Form-47.
“I got 52,000 votes, the runner-up 28,000, but the person who emerged victorious secured 22,000 votes and was at the fourth position.”
Imran endorses Alvi’s move
Separately, PTI founder Imran Khan endorsed President Dr Arif Alvi’s decision to not convene a session of the National Assembly.
 
 

The people’s mandate has been stolen through massive rigging and the biggest dacoity, he said while talking to the media at the Adiala Jail on Tuesday.
Mr Khan said he had dictated a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), adding that he was not in contact with the party leaders and the letter would be dispatched to the fund within a day after a discussion with his party leaders. He said that the IMF would be apprised that the economy could not be stabilised without political stability.
The former premier recalled that the PML-N and the PPP had demanded the withdrawal of cases for extending support to the legislation related to the Financial Action Task Force.
Mr Khan also demanded the resignation of the chief election commissioner over the rigging as he had failed to provide a level playing field to the PTI during the election. He criticised the ECP for depriving his party of the reserved seats.
He termed the caretaker government ‘hostile’ and that every effort was made to eliminate the PTI, which emerged stronger than before after the general election.
The PTI founder said his party was contacting all political parties whose mandate was stolen in the election and it would give a protest call on Saturday.
Dogar for speaker
PTI leader Omer Ayub, on the other hand, said Imran Khan had nominated Amir Dogar for the position of the National Assembly speaker while Junaid Khan would contest for the slot of deputy speaker.
The announcement was made after Mr Ayub and other party leaders held a string of meetings with the imprisoned PTI chief in the Adiala Jail.
Mr Dogar served as the chief whip in the NA during the PTI government. He also served as the special assistant to the prime minister on political affairs and was among the several PTI leaders who were arrested in the aftermath of the May 9 attacks.

4,20-member cabinet ‘sans allies’ likely in Punjab,"PPP, IPP also expected to get ministries in the second phase.","LAHORE: After the swearing-in of Punjab Chief Minister Mar­yam Nawaz, consultations over the formation of provincial cabinet have started in the Sharif camp.
In the first phase, a 20-member cabinet is lik­ely to be formed this week.
The PML-N leadership also held talks with its all­ied parties — PPP, PML-Q and Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), which are also expected to get ministries in the cabinet in the second phase.
Senior PML-N leaders Rana Sanaullah, Pervaiz Rashid and Marriyum Aurangzeb are likely to be accommodated in the provincial cabinet.
Mr Sanaullah and Mr Rashid are expected to be inducted as special assist­ants or advisers to the CM, as they are not members of the Punjab Assembly.
Mr Sanaullah, who is considered close to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, is expected to get the coveted portfolios of home and law. He had served as the provincial law minister in the last tenure of former chief minister Shehbaz Sharif from 2013 to 2018.
Later, he also served as the interior minister in the 16-month stint of the PDM government in the Centre following the ouster of former premier Imran Khan through a no-confidence motion.
Mr Sanaullah contested and lost the National Assembly election against a PTI-backed independent candidate from his hometown, Faisalabad.
There is still no clarity over what portfolio is to be given to Mr Rashid, another confidant of the Sharif brothers and a former senator.
Mr Rashid has been attending every administrative meeting that Ms Sharif has chaired since taking the oath on Monday.
There are also reports that the Sharif family may send Mr Rashid back to the Senate, but a final decision in this regard will be made by Nawaz Sharif.
“Interestingly, both Sanaullah and Rashid are not on good terms, and in case Nawaz Sharif decides to depute them in Punjab to assist his daughter, they will have to shun their egos,” a party insider told Dawn on Tuesday.
He added that outspoken party leader, Azma Bokhari, is being given the portfolio of information ministry while Ms Auranzeb, who has been brought to Punjab from the centre to assist the CM, would also get an important ministry. Both were inducted into the assembly on reserved seats for women.
Other names doing rounds as possible cabinet ministers are Bilal Yasin (a relative of Mr Nawaz), Faisal Ayub Khokhar (son of PML-N Lahore president Saiful Malook Khokhar), Zakiya Shahnawaz, Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman, Manshaullah Butt, Khizar Hussain Mazari, Ashiq Karmani, Ahmad Khan Leghari, Sher Ali Gorchani, Raheela Khadim Hussain and Sibtain Bokhari.
PPP, PML-Q and IPP lawmakers, to be inducted in the cabinet at a later stage, may not get any important ministries.
CM visits Civil Secretariat
Meanwhile, CM Maryam held a meeting with the provincial bureaucracy at the Civil Secretariat in Lahore. She was also briefed by the secretaries about their departments’ performance.
 






Speaking on the occasion, Ms Sharif vowed not to “violate merit”. “There will be no political appointments in government departments,” she said while emphasising the need for structural reforms.“
She also presided over a meeting to collect data on deserving people in the province and directed the departments concerned to initiate the repair and maintenance of roads. The CM also visited the Punjab Safe City Authority headquarters and ordered the launch of similar projects in all districts by December 31.
