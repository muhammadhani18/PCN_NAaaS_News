0,PHC stops police from arresting Gandapur,Seeks details of cases registered against PTI nominee for CM,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday directed the federal and provincial governments to inform it about the cases registered against MPA-elect and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s nominee for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s office Ali Amin Gandapur.
It also stopped the police from arresting the PTI leader in any case.
While issuing notices to the federal and provincial governments for details of cases against Mr Gandapur, a bench consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Wiqar Ahmad fixed March 19 for the next hearing into the petition of the CM hopeful.
The petitioner has sought directives of the court for the governments to provide him with details of cases registered and inquiries being conducted against him.
Advocate Shah Faisal Uthmankehl appeared for Mr Gandapur and said his client, who was elected both MNA and MPA from Dera Ismail Khan in the Feb 8 polls, was a law-abiding citizen.

Seeks details of cases registered against PTI nominee for CM

He said that the petitioner, a central leader of the PTI, was nominated by the party for the slot of KP chief minister.
The lawyer said that scores of cases had been registered against the petitioner in different parts of the country, including Punjab.
He added that while the petitioner was aware of some cases in which he was granted protective bail by the high court, there might be several other cases about which he had not been provided any information by the government.
The counsel feared that the petitioner might be arrested in any new case as personnel of the Punjab police had reportedly been roaming around in Peshawar.
The bench wondered how the Punjab police could arrest a person here, as there was a set procedure for that purpose. It observed that unless the required mechanism was followed, the Punjab police couldn’t arrest anyone here.
The counsel contended that under Article 19-A of the Constitution, which guaranteed people’s access to information, it was the right of the petitioner to get information about the cases registered against him or any inquiry started against him by any of the law-enforcement agencies.
On Feb 15, the high court’s Dera Ismail Khan bench granted transit bail to Mr Gandapur in 26 cases registered against him in several police stations, mostly in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.
It fixed different dates in March for the petitioner to approach the relevant courts in those cases.
TRANSIT BAIL: The bench granted transit bail to MNA-elect and former federal minister Sheikh Waqas Akram until March 18, directing him to approach the relevant high court over criminal cases by then.
The petitioner, who has been elected from NA-109 Jhang as a PTI-backed independent candidate, moved the court to for the provision of information to him by the federal and provincial governments about cases registered against him.
The bench observed that the petitioner had to approach the relevant high court to seek details of cases registered in Punjab and Islamabad,.
The petitioner’s counsel said a day ago, the high court had granted transit bail to the petitioner for 20 days in two cases registered in Punjab.
He said the petitioner wanted to surrender to the relevant courts, but he feared that he might be arrested in any undeclared cases.
The lawyer requested the bench to restrain law-enforcement agencies from arresting his client in any case to enable him to approach the relevant courts.

Mr Gandapur told them in a meeting at the Speaker’s House here that his government would utilise all available legal options to protect the “mandate given by the people to the PTI-nominated independent candidates.”
He also said that he would serve the people of every city and village on a priority basis and ensure the judicial use of development funds in the province.
The meeting was attended by PTI leaders from the provincial capital, including the newly-elected lawmakers. MNA-elect Sher Ali Arbab led the visitors.
The PTI leaders insisted that many of them had won the Feb 8 elections, but the returning officers of their constituencies declared other candidates winners by changing Form 45 results. They alleged that election results were changed in eight provincial assembly constituencies, including PK-72, PK-73, PK-74, PK-75, PK-78, PK79, PK-80 and PK-82, and one National Assembly constituency, NA-20, for the defeat of PTI-backed candidates.
The visitors also demanded the launch of a mega development project for Peshawar. They insisted that the provincial capital was ignored by successive governments, as no one from there was elected chief minister in the last few decades.
Mr Arbab said that government employees belonging to different parts of the province had occupied the positions meant for the people of the provincial capital.
He said that the “legal right” of Peshawarites to government jobs should be protected. The PTI leaders also demanded the early completion of the Ring Road project.

During the heated exchange of words, Nazir asked his brother to shoot his father (Umar), he added.
The complainant said Asfandyar started firing at his father with a pistol, killing him on the spot. He said both the brothers escaped after the incident.
He said the cause of the killing was a dispute involving a woman. 
The police were looking for the accused.
Meanwhile, Awami National Party leaders said on Tuesday the governments being formed in the four provinces and at the centre won’t be able to function smoothly.
Talking to mediapersons, they said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government in Punjab would be weak as Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had also announced to establish a parallel government and elect its own chief minister, speaker and deputy speaker.
“Instead of moving towards stabilisation the country would be further dragged into chaos and destabilisation,” said Awwal Sher Khan, former provincial minister for forest.
He said the complicated issue was that a number of parties were protesting the ‘theft’ of their mandate in the Feb 8 elections.
Nawabzada, ANP district general secretary, said his party had already launched a protest campaign against the ‘manipulated’ election results. He alleged ANP paid the prices in elections for opposing the reversal of the Eighteenth Amendment.

3,Drugs shortage in hospitals blamed on centralised purchasing system,Health secretary says procurement process of medicines under way,"PESHAWAR: Public sector hospitals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have run out of medicines and disposable items as health department has started centralised procurement process, which may further delay supplies to the facilities for patients, according to sources.
They said that district health officers and medical superintendents of hospitals used to purchase medicines and other stuff according to their needs but in the current year directorate-general health services (DGHS) was tasked to purchase drugs and supply the same to districts.
A district health officer said that DGHS office through directorate of drugs and pharmacy prepared medicine coordination committee (MCC)’s list of items and districts were authorised to purchase from the same list. For that purpose, the department released the amount for drugs to districts which they spent as per their own needs, he added.
“However, this year centralised purchase system has been started under which DGHS will procure medicines and make supplies to district hospitals. This will further delay the process of making available drugs at district level,” he said.

Health secretary says procurement process of medicines under way

The DHO said that health department started centralised purchase in 2021-22 at DGHS level but it was in addition to the system under which the district purchased medicines for themselves.
A medical superintendent in one of the central districts told Dawn that hospitals should have got medicine supplies by August last year. He said that only four months were left in the current financial year but they were without medicines.
Sources in health department said that finance department had released Rs3 billion to purchase drugs for about 2,500 health facilities in the province. “The procurement process is in progress but is unlikely to complete soon and districts get medicines,” they said.
They said that the centralised mechanism should be revoked and the old system should be restored under which districts bought medicines at local level from the MCC’s approved list.
Officials at health department said that they sought Rs9 billion from government to purchase medicines but owning to financial constraints, they received Rs3 billion as only a few months were left of the current financial year.
Last month, DGHS through health secretary wrote a letter to government, saying that they faced acute shortage of emergency medicines, anti-rabies vaccine, immunoglobulin and other essential items. He requested the government to release the amount to make procurement for the year 2024. He feared that non-release of the requested amount could lead to lack of medicines for emergencies and subsequent public backlash.
The director general health had pointed out that timely procurement and distribution of essential medicines to hospitals were imperative to prevent potential disruptions that could lead to law and order challenges.
In case of any further delay there might be compromised management of emergencies and suffering of people owing to non-availability of lifesaving vaccines like anti-rabies vaccine and anti-snake venom etc, he said.
He also informed the government that medicine firms and vendors were not ready to supply medicines as the department was required to pay their liabilities.
Senior DHOs said that government should allow districts to make purchase at the local level so that patients could get drugs in a timely manner. They said that the centralised purchase system would cause delay every year.
Health Secretary Mahmood Aslam Wazir told Dawn that procurement process was under way. “DGHS is looking after the matter,” he said.

The trader leader said that the dilapidated roads damaged vehicles. 

Demand repair of arteries to address traffic issues

He insisted that the funds meant for road repairs and blacktopping were not spent.
Mr Solaria said that traders regularly paid taxes, but the relevant departments didn’t take their issues seriously. 
“We took up this issue with the communication and works department, but to no avail,” he said. 
Trader Rub Nawaz Mughal said that potholed roads often witnessed traffic mess, so authorities should immediately repair and blacktop them.

Meanwhile, the local government department will soon provide its services to people under one roof, said assistant director Hamid Khan on Monday. 
“Work has been completed on the multi-storey complex that will house our offices to offer services to people from across Hazara division,” he said.

12,Fazl says his party not interested in PA opposition leader’s slot,Insists the ‘system’ will collapse.,"PESHAWAR: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday said his party would neither become part of any government nor was it interested in the opposition leader’s position in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
Talking to reporters at the JUI-F’s headquarters here after the meeting of the party’s provincial leadership, Mr Fazl said his party didn’t want to join the government.
“It is our principled stance that we will not become part of any government,” he said.
The JUI-F leader also said his party was not interested in the opposition leader’s position in the KP Assembly.
He said his party would stay away from the presidential polls as well.

Insists the ‘system’ will collapse

“We have not been pushed out of the system, and rather, we have decided to stay out of it,” he said.
Mr Fazl said his party didn’t want to “see politicians rely” on the security establishment.
He, however, said the establishment wielded authority and was determined to see both assemblies and their members of their own choosing.
The JUI-F chief added that the establishment was even asking political parties to field particular candidates for key slots.
He said parliament should represent the people and not the establishment.
Mr Fazl said the upcoming government won’t be able to steer the country out of crises.
“This system will collapse,” he said.
The JUI-F leader said his party had fought for the country, but the establishment treated it badly.
“The establishment is to blame for rigging in the Feb 8 general elections,” he said.
Mr Fazl said if polls weren’t rigged, then what happened to the “May 9 narrative” and that the powers-that-be should acknowledge that the nation had voted for a “rebel.”
When asked about the JUI-F’s disassociation from parliamentary politics, he said only the party’s central general council had the powers to make such a decision.
The JUI-F chief said views of the party’s all four provincial chapters would be placed before the general council in its next meeting.
To another question, he said it was not wise to involve the International Monetary Fund in Pakistan’s every issue, as the way the global lender had handled the country so far was not good.
Regarding his party’s engagement with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Mr Fazl said he welcomed the PTI’s move.
“We have differences about them [PTI] and have reservations regarding their agenda and ways. We both have many obstacles to overcome,” he said.
He said whenever a political force showed willingness to address the other’s reservations, dialogue took place.
“There is a long way to go before we [JUI-F and PTI] resolve our differences, but it is a good beginning, “he said.
Mr Fazl said he never liked to see politicians go to jail.
He claimed that the people did not subscribe to the notion that voters had rejected his party.
“We know our strength,” he said.
Without naming names, he said those having issues with his party’s Islamic credentials did not want to see its members in large numbers in assemblies.
The JUI-F leader insisted that the establishment and the ruling elite were opposed to the introduction of Islamic laws in the country.
He said his party helped spread anti-Americanism in the region after 9/11, and therefore, world forces were not interested in seeing its members go to assemblies.
Mr Fazl also claimed that his role in brokering peace between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban didn’t sit well with the West.

16,Wheat shortage feared in Chitral,CHITRAL: The wheat stock in warehouses of the food department in Lower Chital is said to have drastically depleted...,"CHITRAL: The wheat stock in warehouses of the food department in Lower Chital is said to have drastically depleted causing fears of acute shortage of the staple grain.
An official of the food department told Dawn on Tuesday that the main warehouse of the department had a stock of just 2,000 bags (each 100kg) and about 1,000 bags in different godowns across the district, bringing the total to 3,000.
He said that in the absence of replenishment for last two months, a grave situation had arisen as fresh arrivals were expected by the next month.
During a session of the Chitral tehsil council last week, chairmen of different village councils had taken up the issue of wheat shortage, and expressed their apprehensions over an imminent ‘famine-like situation’ in the district.
Meanwhile, speakers at a consultative workshop on ‘disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction’ held here the other day demanded that specific needs of the disabled persons should be given due weight while planning disaster risk reduction. 
Held under the aegis of National Integrated Development Association (Nida), the participants said Chitral was highly prone to natural disasters triggered by climate change, thus increasing the urgency of the matter.
They said due to rampant poverty in the area and lack of healthcare facilities, the number of disabled persons was also on the rise, but they had been neglected in formulation of disaster risk reduction plans.
The speakers included Anwar Baig, Atif Sheikh and Rustam Sheraz representing Nida, while officers of the line departments and representatives of stakeholders were also in attendance.

17,Play staged in Peshawar to motivate students for meeting future challenges,The stage play titled ‘Imtehan’ was written by late Prof Mohammad Azam in early 60s during his student life.,"PESHAWAR: A Pashto play was staged here on Tuesday to raise awareness among students to focus on their set targets towards facing future challenges and never get involved in unhealthy activities on the campus.
The stage play titled ‘Imtehan’ was written by late Prof Mohammad Azam Azam in early 60s during his student life.
The modern version of the play was directed by former PTV producer Masood Ahmad Shah. It was staged at Agha Khan Auditorium, University of Peshawar, under the auspices of Niaz Adabi Sangar (NAS) in collaboration with Dosti Welfare Organisation as part of its thirrd edition of 11-day Peshawar Literature Festival ( PLF).
A large number of students, teachers and visitors watched the stage play. Around nine students performed in the live stage play and earned a thunderous applause from the audience.
Shazia Rehan, a student of English department, told this scribe that the hour-long live performance was filled with clandestine humour blended in high seriousness of boarding student life.
Prof Aseer Mangal, chairman of NAS, on the occasion said that the play being relevant was staged for raising awareness among students to devote themselves to achieving their desired career goals and avoid idle activities on the campus. He added that university campuses served as the seat of learning alongside grooming up youth for future social and political challenges.
Masood Ahmad Shah said that the script of the play carried a significant message for youth and therefore, the performance registered a wholesome impact on tasteful audience. He said that such live theatrical performances should be encouraged on campus.
Jalaludin Mamoond, a student from Bajaur tribal district, who played a role in the play, stated that its central theme revolved around purposeful use of time and its wastage led to disastrous end as most students residing in the hostels away from their parents’ eyes spent their precious time in pointless things on the campus.
Prof Gulzar Jalal Yousafzai remarked that late Prof Azam being a renowned playwright knew the psyche of students and parents’ expectations, therefore, organisers selected it from a collection of his personal essays and adapted for live stage performance.
“I strongly believe such live plays, if encouraged, will help to instil a spirit of future vision among youth. Mr Shah and young performers did perfect justice to the show,” he said.
