0,Four ‘Pakistanis’ on trial for running arms to Yemen,"Embassy official says they are ""aware of the situation"" and in touch with US authorities.","WASHINGTON: Four individuals carrying Pakistani identity papers faced charges in a US federal court on Tuesday for allegedly transporting weapons from Iran to Yemen in support of Houthis.
The US Justice Department said 10 other individuals were also detained as material witnesses, but their identities were not revealed. They have also been charged in a US court in the Eastern District of Virginia.
On the night of Jan 11, US Central Command Navy forces, including Navy SEALs, along with members of the US Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Team, boarded an unnamed vessel in the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Somalia.
 
 

While searching the vessel, US forces found and seized Iranian-made adva­nced conventional weaponry, includ­ing critical parts for medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, a warhead, and propulsion and guidance components, an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

Embassy official says they are ‘aware of the situation’ and in touch with US authorities

The type of weaponry found aboard the dhow is allegedly consistent with the weaponry used by the Houthi forces in recent attacks on US military ships and merchant ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the Justice Department said.
The US Navy brought the 14 mariners aboard the USS Lewis B. Puller after determining the dhow was unsafe and unseaworthy. The defendants and their co-defendants were transferred from the USS Lewis B. Puller to the Eastern District of Virginia.
The four defendants and eight of the 10 material witnesses made their initial appearances before a US Magistrate Judge in Richmond.
On Feb 11, the US obtained arrest warrants for four of the mariners who were aboard the vessel — defendants Mohammad Pahlawan, Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufranullah and Izhar Mohammad. Pakistani identification cards allegedly were found on the dhow for each of the four defendants.
When Dawn contacted a Pakistan embassy official in Washington, he said, “We are aware of the situation and in touch with US authorities.”
In such cases, the embassy first tries to confirm the identity of individuals as Pakistanis and then seeks consular access to them.
Defendant Pahlawan is charged with intentionally and unlawfully transporting on board the dhow a warhead, knowing the warhead would be used by the Houthi forces against commercial and naval vessels in the Red Sea and surrounding waters. He is also charged with providing materially false information to US Coast Guard officers during the boarding of the dhow regarding the vessel’s crew and cargo.
 
 

“As charged, Mr Pahlawan attempted to smuggle advanced missile components, including a warhead,” to Houthi forces for use against cargo ships and US vessels sailing across the Horn of Africa, said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen.
His co-defendants Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufranullah and Izhar Muhammad were also charged with providing materially false information to US Coast Guard officers during the boarding of the dhow regarding the vessel’s crew and cargo.
“The Justice Department will use every legal authority to hold accountable those who facilitate the flow of weapons from Iran to Houthi rebel forces, Hamas, and other groups that endanger the security of the United States and our allies,” said US Attorney General Merrick B. Garland while commenting on the case.
“The flow of missiles and other advanced weaponry from Iran to Houthi rebel forces in Yemen threatens the people and interests of America and our partners in the region,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.
The arrests shed light on the US effort to curb alleged weapon supplies from Iran to Houthis. The claim that Pakistani nationals were involved in the smuggling raises questions about regional dynamics and potential increase in broader geopolitical tensions.
The detailed weaponry seized underscores US concerns about the Houthis’ capabilities and their impact on security in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
The statements from US Attorney General Garland and Deputy Attorney General Monaco emphasise the US concern about the flow of advanced weaponry to groups in the region.
Also, the Pentagon identified two drowned persons US Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J. Chambers and Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram, who jumped in to try to save the former but he drowned too.

1,"On Balakot anniversary, ISPR stresses desire for regional peace",ISLAMABAD: The military on the fifth anniversary of Operation Swift Retort has underscored Pakistan’s desire for...,"ISLAMABAD: The military on the fifth anniversary of Operation Swift Retort has underscored Pakistan’s desire for peaceful coexistence with neighbours while firmly stating its readiness to counter any aggression with full force. 
“As a state committed to peace, we shall continue to emphasise the importance of peaceful coexistence with our neighbours. Any aggression against the people of Pakistan, our sovereignty and territorial integrity, will however be responded immediately, with full might and without any hesitation. Every single time,” ISPR said.
The aerial confrontations with India followed the 2019 Pulwama bombing, which escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations.
The ISPR statement commemorated ‘Oper­ation Swift Retort’ that Pakistan’s military launc­hed in response to the Indian Air Force’s strike in Balakot. The IAF operation, Delhi claimed, was in retaliation to the Pulwama attack on Feb 14, 2019, resulting in the death of 40 Indian soldiers.
Describing OSR as a “significant event in our history”, the ISPR asserted it was a response to “unwarranted aggression from India, motivated by political considerations and electoral concerns”. 
On Feb 27, 2019 Pakistan shot down a MiG-21 and captured Wing Comm­ander Abhinandan, who was later released as a peace gesture. “The steadfastness and competence of Pakistan’s armed forces were acknowledged by military experts and analysts across the world, effectively debunking frivolous Indian claims which could not stand to factual scrutiny,” the ISPR added. 
This incident underscored Pakistan’s firm commitment to defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, reflecting a consistent policy stance in the face of current challenges.

2,PML-N senator questions credibility of elections,"Lawmakers decry harassment of woman in Lahore, seek release of PTI women activists, leaders.","ISLAMABAD: While backing the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s demand for allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) after the PTI-backed independent candidates joined it, a PML-N senator on Tuesday questioned the credibility of elections and said the Chief Election Commissioner should have resigned for his failure to hold transparent polls.
“The credibility of the elections is known to all. This abuse must not be advanced anymore”, Senator Saadia Abbasi said, recalling that the 2018 elections, too, were not transparent.
 
 

Senator Abbasi said the PML-N was in the same situation in 2018 the PTI finds itself at present. She called for release of PTI women and activists behind bars for months, including Dr Yasmeen Rashid and Sanam Javed, while demanding the issuance of production orders for Senators Ejaz Chaudhry and Shibli Faraz.
A highlight of the day’s proceedings was a noisy protest followed by a token walkout by PTI senators against the continued detention of PTI women leaders and activists.

Lawmakers decry harassment of woman in Lahore, seek release of PTI women activists, leaders

Shortly after the PTI rejoined the session following the lawmakers’ walkout, PTI Senator Syed Ali Zafar criticised PML-N and PPP for laying claim on SIC reserved seats, saying he never expected such an undemocratic attitude from them.
He dubbed four imprisoned women of the party as “prisoners of conscience”. Demanding their immediate release, he warned that this practice should be stopped at once, otherwise, women of other parties could face similar situation in future.
Some lawmakers also called for strict action against all those involved in harassing a woman in Lahore for wearing a shirt printed with Arabic calligraphy.
Speaking on a point of public concern, PPP Senator Rubina Khalid said it was unfortunate that a woman in Lahore was harassed only because she was wearing a shirt with Arabic letters printed on it.

“The scenes that have become viral are horrific,” she said and deplored how Arabic letters were misunderstood as holy verses. She said the incident reflected “utter ignorance” and “intolerance” of society. She said the enraged mob would have done something worse if the police had not reached in time to protect the woman.
Objecting to the video in which the victim had to apologise, she questioned why she was forced to make a public apology for the action she had never committed.
MQM-Pakistan Senator Faisal Subzwari said making false allegation of blasphemy was the worst form of disrespect to Islam. “I wish the House could have made a proposed legislation over the misuse of blasphemy laws,” he said, adding that he would love to present that piece of legislation in the house.

JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza said women were seen with respect in society, noting that the detention of PTI women for an indefinite period of time was against the values of society. “This reflects lawlessness in the society,” he said. While naming Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and PPP leader Faryal Talpur, he said what had happened to the women of other parties was also wrong.
Irsa chairman’s power
PPP Senator Shahadat Awan warned against a move to limit the powers of water regulatory authority through an ordinance. He said promulgation of an ordinance while the senate was in session would be unconstitutional.
He said the IRSA chairman bypassing the Council of Common Interests (CCI) tried to curtail the power of the regulatory authority. He said it was beyond the mandate of the caretakers and said the member from Sindh had opposed it.

3,Over 130 pilots grounded due to licence renewal delays: Aircraft Owners and Operators Association,"The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, on the other hand, claims that procedure for renewing a pilot’s licence continues.","RAWALPINDI: More than 130 pilots have been grounded and they cannot fly planes as their licences have not been renewed by Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), Aircraft Owners and Operators Association Pakistan (AOOA) said on Tuesday.
In a press statement issued here, the AOOA said the PCAA is not renewing licences of these grounded pilots.
It demanded officials concerned to amend the Civil Aviation Act, 2023, which has affected the aviation industry.
The AOOA said the Civil Aviation Act, 2023, passed by the previous assembly is not acceptable to the aviation industry as it is being misused.
The PCAA, on the other hand, claimed that procedure for renewing a pilot’s licence continues and current rules and regulations are being strictly adhered to in this regard.
“The procedure for obtaining or renewing a pilot’s licence continues. The current regulations are strictly adhered to during the licence issuance or renewal process,” the PCAA claimed.
 
 

The AOOA said it is preparing amendments in the new law and will submit it to the aviation committee of the parliament.
It said that 130 pilots licences have been pending for renewal, but the PCAA officials do not know who will sign these renewal documents.
The AOOA said that all powers have been delegated to the director general of PCAA and all other relevant departments have taken a back seat.
The DG of PCAA is seldom available in Karachi to take care of the PCAA issues as most of the time he remains in Islamabad.
The association said the new act has given full authority to the federal government to appoint a non-professional and non-technocrat DG, paving the way for a jack of all trades to grab the post.
On the other hand, a spokesman for the PCAA said that in accordance with the regulations outlined in the CAA Act, 2023, the procedure for obtaining or renewing a pilot’s licence continues.
The spokesman further said that the current regulations are strictly being adhered to during the licence issuance or their renewal process. It is an exaggeration to claim that pilots are unable to fly or that their licences’ issuance/renewal process has been stopped, he said.
He said local airlines have the authority to hire foreign pilots as they are permitted by the PCAA regulations. Once approved by the ministry, foreign pilots are granted a work visa and subsequently they are issued a validation certificate.

4,"‘Silence, complicity of Arab nations hurtful’",Palestinian doctor says Gaza has turned into a place of despair and suffering.,"KARACHI: Amid the death and devastation that has been unleashed against Gaza by Israel over the past several months, the thing that perhaps hurts Palestinians the most is the inaction of their Muslim brethren in the Middle East.
 

Dr Izzeldin Abuelaish

“The silence and, at times, complicity of certain Arab countries is indeed disheartening. They mistakenly believe they are immune to the risks faced by Palestinians,” says Dr Izzeldin Abuelaish — a Palestinian-Canadian born and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp.
A Harvard-trained fertility specialist and the first Palestinian doctor to work in an Israeli hospital, he is no stranger to tragedy; he lost three daughters when an Israeli tank destroyed his home in Gaza, just months after his wife passed away from leukaemia.
Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize multiple times, Dr Abuelaish subsequently left Gaza with his surviving children and is now a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.

Palestinian doctor says Gaza has turned into a place of despair and suffering

In an interview with DawnNews English, Dr Abuelaish — who is currently visiting Karachi on the invitation of Charter for Compassion — described how the situation in Gaza has worsened, turning it into a place of despair and suffering.
 


“I still have hope in this world, but hope is not just a mere word,” he asserts. “It requires belief and action. We cannot simply wait for things to change; we need to actively contribute to the transformation.”
Dr Abuelaish has stayed in close contact with relatives and friends in Gaza, having visited this summer before the current conflict. “The first thing I do when I return is to visit the graves of my daughters,” he shares, taking a moment to wipe away tears. “I want to ensure they know that they are not forgotten.”
Tragedy struck again on November 7 when an Isra­eli airstrike hit the home where his relatives were sheltering in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing 22 members of his extended family, including cousins, nephews, and nieces.
 
 

Despite facing hardships, Dr Abuelaish’s family remains steadfast in their decision to stay, expressing an unwavering determination to avoid another Nakba. “We refuse to be displaced again,” he says, adding that “leaving is not an option”.
Rather than surrendering to hatred, Dr Abuelaish channelled his anguish into an acclaimed book, I Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor’s Journey on the Road to Peace and Human Dignity.
“Hate is destructive and contagious,” he reflects. “It is not a feeling or emotion but a disease. It is a poison that impedes rational thinking.”
However, he voiced disappointment in the global community’s passive stance as it witnesses the Israeli bombardment and blockade of Gaza. He deems the world complicit in the loss of innocent lives and finds it disheartening to witness the international community’s failure to uphold human rights conventions.
“Before October 7, the Palestinian issue had become somewhat trivialized in certain regions, but now people worldwide are awakening to the realities faced by Palestinians,” remarks Dr Abuelaish.
He believes that this momentum, fueled by public awareness, has the potential to influence political leaders positively.

5,Biden hopeful Gaza truce to begin next week,Negotiators propose six-week pause in fighting and a deal to exchange prisoners.,"GAZA STRIP: A new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could start as soon as March 4 and last through Ramazan, US President Joe Biden said on Monday about an expected deal that would also free Israeli prisoners held in Gaza.
In the protracted bid to broker a truce, mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been putting proposals to the parties, with negotiations still ongoing.
They are seeking a six-week halt to the fighting and the release of prisoners.
The truce deal could include the release of several hundred Palestinian detainees held by Israel, media reports suggested.
 






“My hope is by next Monday (March 4) we’ll have a ceasefire,” Biden said in reply to a question about when a truce might start, adding: “We’re close, we’re not done yet.”

Negotiators propose six-week pause in fighting and a deal to exchange prisoners

He later said an agreement “in principle” was in reach for a temporary truce to last through Ramazan.
Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, whose country hosts Hamas leaders and helped broker a one-week truce in November, arrived in Paris on Tuesday.
Sheikh Tamim has met Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Doha as part of his bid for an “immediate and permanent ceasefire agreement”, the official Qatar News Agency said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed that any truce would delay, not prevent, a ground invasion of Rafah in the far south of the Gaza Strip.
There has been huge international pressure, including from the United States, for Israel to hold off on sending troops into Rafah, where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinian civilians have sought refuge.
Netanyahu’s office said on Monday that the Israeli military had shown the “war cabinet” its plan for moving civilians out from Rafah, but no details have been released on where those displaced people might go.
Final nail in coffin
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that any assault on Rafah, the entry point to Gaza for desperately needed relief supplies, would “put the final nail in the coffin” of aid operations. “Nothing can justify Hamas’s deliberate killing, injuring, torturing and kidnapping of civilians” and “nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” Guterres said on Monday.
‘Targeted raids’
Israel carried out more than 50 strikes on Tuesday, with Rafah and the other main southern city of Khan Yunis among the main targets.
The Israeli army said troops had carried out “targeted raids” in the Zeitun neighbourhood of central Gaza and other areas.
The Israelis have killed 29,878 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
Starving Gazans
In northern Gaza, desperate Palestinians have scavenged for food as most aid trucks have been halted, with many people eating animal fodder and even leaves.
 






“We have no flour or anything. We are experiencing famine,” lamented Umm Tahse­ini Al Masry, a Palestinian displaced to the Jabalia refugee camp, north of Gaza City.
The Jordanian army said it carried out a series of humanitarian aid drops, while Human Rights Watch accused the Israeli government of starving Gaza’s 2.4 million people.
The UNRWA said humanitarian assistance entering Gaza has halved this month from January. Israeli officials say they are allowing aid into Gaza, but relief supplies have hit a logjam inside the territory..
