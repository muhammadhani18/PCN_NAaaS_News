0,Three opposition parties demand fresh elections,"GDA, JI and JUI-F observe ‘black day’ against Feb 24 police action, poll rigging.","

As part of their Sindh-wide protest against ‘rigged’ elections, workers of the GDA, JI and JUI-Fazl stage demonstrations outside the Karachi and Hyderabad (right) press clubs on Tuesday. — PPI / Umair Ali

 
KARACHI: Rejecting the results of Feb 8 polls, the Grand Democratic Alliance, Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazal on Tuesday demanded fresh elections and warned that they would not turn silent and the protest against the alleged rigging would continue with more force and intensity.  
The three parties, which have recently joined hands after suffering defeat in the Feb 8 elections to protest against the ‘manipulated and rigged’ elections, went a step further and set up a joint committee to plan a ‘protest campaign’.  
A large number of workers of the parties gathered outside the Karachi Press Club and staged a protest demonstration in line a province-wide call for observing the ‘black day’.  
The opposition parties had given the call to observe the black day in protest against the police action to scuttle their demonstration planned in front of the Sindh Assembly on Feb 25 in protest over alleged rigging in the Feb 8 elections.  Carrying placards and banners, they chanted slogans against ‘theft’ of mandate. Some protesters were also carrying black flags.  

GDA, JI and JUI-F observe ‘black day’ against Feb 24 police action, poll rigging  

Addressing the protest, GDA’s Dr Safdar Abbasi said that the people of Sindh would not accept the dual faced democracy with bogus results.  
He said that the people had already rejected the politics of hatred and terror whereas those who had imposed criminal elements on Karachiites had done a disservice to Pakistan and the people of this country.  
“The Feb 8 elections were not the elections, they were actually an organised and planned robbery which can never be accepted and forgiven,” he said.  
“Instead of bringing stability and calm, these polls have further deepened instability. If they are accepted and not fixed, they would cause irreparable damage to the country. For the stability of the country, these elections should be declared null and void.” 
In his address, Dr Osama Razi of the JI said that the people would extend the scope of protest if the authorities did not rectify results of the elections as per results according to Form-45s.  
He said that the entire country was paying the price for what happened on February 8 in the name of elections. The protest, he said, will continue till its logical conclusion. He asked the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take notice of the alleged rigging.  
“Those who are celebrating their fake victories are unable to face the public,” he said.  
“Even the formation of the governments in the Centre and provinces has become a challenge for these mandate thieves. Every party which has won doesn’t want to share the burden of the government because it knows that any coalition which is based on fake mandate is not going to survive.”

1,PTI seeks contempt proceedings against ECP,"Says poll supervisory body dismissed their cases without resolving discrepancies in Form-45s and  Form-47s as per SHC order. 
Form-47s as per SHC order","KARACHI: Three Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) candidates, including its Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh, on Tuesday moved the Sindh High Court, seeking contempt proceedings against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not deciding their complaints against the provisional results of the Feb 8 general elections in the light of a court order.
Citing Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, four ECP members and the Sindh election commissioner as the alleged contemnors, the applicants submitted that they had not complied with the SHC order passed on Feb 13 regarding the election complaints of the applicants.
The PTI’s provincial chief submitted that he had contested election from NA-238 (Karachi East-VI) and as per Forms-45 obtained by his polling agents from the presiding officers at all the polling stations of the constituencies in question, he was leading with around 65,000 votes, but the results were changed at the office of the returning officer (RO) since he was shown as runner-up in the impugned Form-47/provisional result.
He stated that the ECP, ROs and others had flouted the electoral laws and rigged the entire process of the polls.
Two other PTI-backed candidates — Abbas Hasnain and Khalid Mehmood who contested the Feb 8 general elections from NA-247 (Karachi Central-I) and NA-231 (Karachi Malir-III) respectively — also filed identical applications and stated that as per From-45s, they were leading with big margins, but they were shown defeated in the impugned Form-47s/provisional results.

Says poll supervisory body dismissed their cases without resolving discrepancies in Form-45s and 
  Form-47s as per SHC order

The applicants submitted that on Feb 13, the SHC disposed of around 50 identical petitions filed by the PTI-backed aspirants against the provisional results and ordered the ECP to decide the petitioners’ complaints through speaking orders before Feb 22.
They also stated that about the issues regarding consolidation of the results, the SHC had also directed the ECP to resolve the discrepancies in Forms-45 and Forms-47 (provisional results) after scrutinising the record available with the ECP or provided by the petitioners.
However, they submitted that the alleged contemnors had dismissed their complaints without speaking orders and passed the actual short orders on Feb 23, but put the date of Feb 21 on such orders to mislead the court.
The applicants also argued that the ECP had also not resolved the issue regarding discrepancies found in Forms-45 and Forms-47 while a false statement was filed before the SHC that the ECP had jurisdiction to decide such issue. But during a hearing in Islamabad, the ECP said it did not have such jurisdiction and the same could not be vested by the order of the SHC, they added.
They also contended that the alleged contemnors had committed deliberate and wilful contempt of the SHC’s Feb 13 order and rendered themselves liable to be proceeded and prosecuted for the contempt of court.
Barrister Ali Tahir said the ECP had rejected the complaints of around 50 candidates backed by the PTI and the remaining aspirants were also set to approach the SHC soon, seeking contempt proceedings against the alleged contemnors.

4,Woman hurt while parasailing near Do Darya,KARACHI: A young woman suffered serious injuries while parasailing when she fell directly into the water near Do...,"KARACHI: A young woman suffered serious injuries while parasailing when she fell directly into the water near Do Darya, it emerged on Tuesday.
The parasailing — sport activity of being pulled up into the air behind a boat while wearing a special parachute — is being conducted by the Karachi Gliding Club (KGC).
A video that went viral on social media shows parasailing gear floating on water as someone can be heard in the background saying the woman doing parasailing and the pilot fell into the water due to a technical fault in the equipment.
When contacted, the owner of the KGC said that the incident happened because of a kite string that appeared out of nowhere, cutting one side of the gear’s strings. This caused the pilot to make a “semi-controlled” landing, he added.
“We typically aim to land on land, but due to the kite string interference, the ground distance was approximately 20-30 metres, leading to this incident. However, no one sustained critical injuries,” he stated.
Mariam A Wahab, a social media user, posted on Facebook that her sister, accompanied by her husband, went for parasailing around midday. However, she fell into the water just before landing. She shared a video in her post, showing a boat approaching two men who are attempting to rescue someone from the water. The video is shot from a distance and pleas of a woman who is screaming ‘please save my daughter’ can be heard.
Dawn contacted the victim’s brother, who said: “No one was there from the management of KGC to rescue her. There was a boat nearby, and luckily it had a doctor who rescued her and got her to South City Hospital. Her backbone is bent due to multiple fractures and she will undergo a major surgery, however she’s out of danger right now.”
“When the incident occurred, the management did not even bother to stop the other members from gliding,” he said.
“The family plans to sue the organisation once the patient gets better,” he added.

5,"Jahangir, Nur Jahan and the power of architecture",Scholar says the Mughal queen’s building projects were undertaken to create a lasting legacy,"KARACHI: Renowned expert on the art, architecture and material culture of Mughal South Asia, Dr Mehreen Chida-Razvi gave an enlightening presentation on ‘Jahangir and Nur Jahan — Creating an Architectural Legacy of Power’ at the Mohatta Palace Museum on Tuesday evening.
She said Nur Jahan was an avid architecture patron during Jahangir’s reign. It was also recognised that her building projects were undertaken with the intent of creating a lasting legacy. Such intent places her within the long tradition of royals’ building for eternal commemoration, a concept that transcends time and space. She was not alone in this way of thinking: as the wife of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, her interest in architectural patronage mirrored that of her husband’s. For Jahangir and all Mughal monarchs, buildings were physical stamps on the geographic landscape of ownership, power and prestige, and as such they played a role in the proclamation of imperial Mughal power.
Dr Chida-Razvi said, “The empire that Jahangir inherited from his father, Akbar, spanned the South Asian peninsula. Prince Salim [the name Jahangir was born with] was the eldest son of Akbar. His birth was regarded as something of a miracle for Akbar had been unable to produce an heir to his throne. It was only after having made a pilgrimage to the village of Sikri to the Sheikh of the Chishti Sufi order named Salim that he was told that he’d have three sons. When his Rajput queen conceived she was sent to Sikri to give birth to her child in the presence of the Sheikh. And a prince was born and named Salim after him. Prince Salim ascended to the Mughal throne on Oct 23, 1605 in Agra. [He later changed his name].
“Six years after becoming padshah, Jahangir met a remarkable woman who was to become his last and favourite wife, Mehrunnisa. Jahangir is said to have met her in 1611, and after two months of courtship, they were wed, after which she was given the title Nur Mahal [light of the palace] and then Nur Jahan [light of the world]. From Babar’s foundation of the Mughal Empire in 1526, royal Mughal women wielded immense influence. These were, however, female members of the family — mothers, foster mothers, sisters etc. Wives, too, played a part but it was not until Nur Jahan’s marriage to Jahangir that a Mughal queen could be considered an equal in imperial stature as the padshah. [In the talk] imperial was related to the emperor and in Nur Jahan’s case to the empress.”

Scholar says the Mughal queen’s building projects were undertaken to create a lasting legacy

The scholar said Nur Jahan was granted privileges and powers no previous Mughal queen had, including some that proclaimed her as Jahangir’s co-sovereign. She issued farmaans (royal decrees) in her own name. She was given the right to mint coins and have her ceremonial kettledrums. The coins and the drums until now were the prerogative of kingship, and in granting them to Nur Jahan, Jahangir overtly proclaimed that he was investing her with his imperial authority.
Dr Chida-Razvi said, “Taking all this into account, it is clear that during Jahangir’s reign, Nur Jahan’s role in the court reformulated, de-centring the commonly understood notion of authority as the concentration of power in the person of the emperor. The singularity of her position at the Mughal court is, however, absent in the historical record. Character assassination is carried out in both Mughal and European contemporary histories, memorialised Nur Jahan as a cunning and manipulative woman who rendered Jahangir a puppet king. From the Mughal perspective, this was rooted in the relationship between Shahjahan, Jahangir’s son and heir apparent until 1622, and Nur Jahan. Shahjahan viewed Nur Jahan as the reason he lost his position as heir apparent in the five years before Jahangir’s death and had been effectively banished from the imperial centre. To say that Shahjahan hated her would not be an exaggeration. And when he did succeed Jahangir, Shahjahan went out of his way to vilify Nur Jahan and remove her from the imperial narrative of Jahangir’s reign.”
She said that from Shahjahan’s accession to the throne in 1628 there was immediate erasure from the historical record of Nur Jahan as Jahangir’s co-sovereign. Through the medium of architecture, however, it is possible to reassert her position of authority in Jahangir’s court. “With her architectural commissions, Nur Jahan projected imperial power, both hers and Jahangir’s. In doing so she further legitimised her role as co-sovereign.”
Dr Chida-Razvi said Mughal royals understood the power of visual art and the lasting implications of artistic and architectural patronage. Building was inherently a political act.
In the latter half of her presentation, she told the audience that the discussion would focus on two architectural commissions of Jahangir [Shahi Qila of Lahore and the tomb he built for his father] and two of Nur Jahan [the tomb she built for Jahangir in Lahore and Sarai Nur Mahal in Jalandhar]. It was nicely done to illustrate how intelligently Nur Jahan through architecture projected her political power. 
The talk was part of the distinguished lecture series commemorating 25 years of the museum.

Some of the artworks displayed at the exhibition.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: It is interesting to note — and perhaps a veritable research subject for our art historians and critics — how strongly Pakistani visual artists feel about the never ending, in certain cases mind-boggling, process of urbanisation. This is something that one does not see feature as the central idea in Pakistani novels and poetry. Even if it does, it does not come across as prominently as it should. To boot, Pakistani painters and sculptors do not take their practice for granted that results in a remarkable combination of contextual richness and technical brilliance. 
A two-person show titled Unreal Estate that’s underway at the Canvas Art Gallery has 28 striking artworks on view not just for those who are drawn to creative souls but for those, too, who wish to see society revert to its serene ways.
The participating artists are Ali Raza and Samina Iqbal. Both seem to be completely in sync with each other despite the fact that their styles are markedly different. The first exhibit, actually, is a collaborative work. It’s called ‘Painting with Painting’ (acrylic on canvas) which sets the tone for what’s to follow.
As one moves around the gallery, one realises that there’s a fair degree of soulfulness to these works. One knows that soulfulness has a poetic connotation. And that’s where the show scores its highest points.
Ali’s ‘Moving Tree’ and Samina’s ‘Red Balloon’ are exceptional exhibits and just a couple of examples — there are more. They speak of time’s tyranny, not the way Shakespeare does in his sonnets; they highlight the changes that occur around us which we tend to overlook but have deep repercussions. It is in that context one is compelled to use the phrase that Ali has used in his statement: communal dysfunctionality.
Poignant stuff! 
The exhibition concludes on Thursday.

7,Rich countries asked to fulfil climate finance obligations,"KARACHI: A large number of fishermen, climate activists and human rights advocates took part in a rally to express...","KARACHI: A large number of fishermen, climate activists and human rights advocates took part in a rally to express solidarity with global effrots demanding insurance companies to stop insuring expansion and operations of fossil fuels projects on Tuesday.  
Organised by the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF), the rally began from Governor House and ended at the Karachi Press Club.  
On the occasion, PFF general secretary Saeed Baloch emphasised that the success of a rapid and equitable phase-out of fossil fuels depends primarily on leaders of developed nations with significant historical responsibility for the climate crisis.  
He stressed the need for wealthy countries to fulfil their climate finance obligations to enable developing nations, which bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite being the least responsible, to transition swiftly to efficient and renewable energy sources.  
He asked Samsung and Tokio Marine to immediately stop providing insurance to coal mines and coal-based power plants.  
“In 2023, worldwide deaths from natural disasters rose to 74,000, which is far above the annual average of 10,000 over the past five years. In the coming years, we expect many more regions to be deemed ‘uninsurable’ by the industry, leaving more families and communities extremely vulnerable as they wait for the next storm, flood or wildfire,” he said.  
Burning fossil fuels is the number one cause of climate crisis. It releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing the world to overheat. These are the facts upon which all leading climate scientists and energy experts are agreed, he added.  
“We already have more coal, oil and gas than we can ever safely burn, but fossil fuel companies show few signs of slowing. If polluters keep drilling and burning new fossil fuels, it will cause the world to heat up dangerously, leading to far more extreme weather events that will make parts of our planet uninhabitable,” he said.  
Insuring and investing in fossil fuels is not even in their best business interests.  
Insurers are losing huge amounts of money to natural catastrophes (like storm, wildfire, flood damage, etc). While insuring fossil fuels earned the industry approximately $21.25 billion in 2022, extreme weather caused an estimated $270 billion in damages, of which approximately $120 billion was insured, it was added.  
“Natural catastrophes have cost the industry an average of $110 billion a year since 2017 (more than twice the average over the previous five years).”  
It was pointed out that insurers were passing the cost of the climate crisis to communities.  
In response to these huge losses, many insurers are raising their home insurance prices to claw back some money.  
Insurers are effectively passing on the cost of their ‘dirty business’ to ordinary consumers.  
This comes at a time when many families are struggling to stay afloat, facing rising costs and a global cost-of-living crisis.  
Passing on costs to people, who are already struggling is unacceptable. Insurers must take responsibility for the disaster they have helped to create, the activists said.  
PFF senior vice-chairperson Fatima Majeed highlighted the fishermen’s participation in these mobilisations to demand an end to the era of fossil fuels, which has caused environmental damages, polluted air and water and exploited communities for profit.  
She stressed that there should be no further insurance to oil, gas, and coal projects anywhere in Asia.  
While expressing her concern about the failure to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, she emphasised the urgent need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.  
She also noted that false solutions like carbon capture, hydrogen, and gas as transition fuels are being promoted contrary to scientific recommendations for a sustainable planet.  
A PFF leader Talib Kuchi referred to recent data confirming that no new fossil fuel extraction can be developed if we are to limit warming to 1.5°C.  
He advocated for the early closure of over half of existing fields and mines while ensuring protection for workers and communities.

The court acquitted five co-accused due to lack of evidence against them.
The ATC announced its verdict after recording evidence and arguments from both sides.
The court found Shakeel alias Banarsi guilty of killing Ijaz alias Mushka in December 2012 within the jurisdiction of the Pakistan Bazaar police station.
The judge also sentenced him to death for possession of an unlicensed weapon.

The court observed that the “proof of motive is not a legal requirement” while imposing the death penalty for murder.
The court also imposed a fine of a total of Rs600,000 and in case of default, the convict would undergo an additional two-year imprisonment.
Regarding the co-accused — Zulfiqar alias Zulfi, Afsar Hussain, Adil alias Pagla, Manzoor alias Bakra and Kashif Siddiqui — the court acquitted them and ruled that the prosecution failed to prove its case against them.
According to the prosecution, the victim was sitting outside his house in Orangi Town when four persons on two motorcycles emerged there, opened fire on him and rode away.
The wounded victim was immediately shifted to a hospital where doctors pronounced him death during the treatment.
The convict was apprehended by the Azizabad police station for possessing explosive substance. During interrogation, he disclosed to his involvement in the killing of the PPP worker.
The police had recovered a 9mm pistol on a lead provided by him.
A case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 109 (abetment), and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 23 (i) of the Sindh Arms Act.

11,"Rallies held across Sindh against ‘massive rigging’, ‘stolen mandate’",LARKANA: Protest demonstrations and rallies were held in almost all district headquarters as well as smaller cities...,"LARKANA: Protest demonstrations and rallies were held in almost all district headquarters as well as smaller cities and towns of the interior of Sindh on Tuesday against, what is alleged by all opposition parties, “blatant massive rigging” in the February 8 general elections.
The protests were oranised and led by leaders of Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Sindh United Party, National Peoples Party (NPP) and other allied parties.
Speaking to participants at different rallies, the leaders strongly condemned the alleged rigging to “thrust plunderers of national wealth rejected by the masses upon the people of Pakistan”. They also condemned violent police action against participants of a recent demonstration outside the Sindh Assembly building in Karachi.
Most of the speakers at the appeared to be the candidates who had won their National Assembly or Sindh Assembly seats as per the form 45 with a big margin but declared losers in the belatedly released form 47.
In Larkana city, the JUI-F and JI took out a joint rally from Fish Market to the local press club where Maulana Mohammed Ilyas Channa, Raja Shaikh and Dr Mazhar Mughal addressed the participants, who were raising slogans and displaying banners and placards inscribed with slogans against “dacoity on public mandate”.
They deplored that the Feb 8 elections in Sindh were stolen by the Pakistan Peoples Party by using state machinery and funds.
They condemned baton charge and teargas shelling on peaceful protesters in Karachi. Even women protesters were dragged, beaten up and stuffed in police vans during a crackdown on the protesters, they deplored.
The speakers criticised 15-year rule of PPP in Sindh, and said corruption had crept into all departments and citizens’ rights were snatched away.

14,Bidding for lining of K.B. Feeder canal  to be held afresh on March 20,HYDERABAD: The International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for the lining of Kalri Baghar Feeder Upper will now be held...,"HYDERABAD: The International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for the lining of Kalri Baghar Feeder Upper will now be held on March 20. The process was cancelled earlier following anomalies pointed out by irrigation secretary last year. 
National and international firms would apply for the contract through bidding on March 20 for which notice inviting tender (NIT) had already appeared in newspapers.
K.B. feeder is the only right bank canal of Kotri Barrage that feeds Keenjhar Lake, which then supplies water to provincial capital. The federal government had approved the lining scheme at a cost of around Rs41bn in 2021 as the project was to meet water needs of Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, commonly referred to as K-IV.
As per NIT, the contract had three major packages, including cement concrete lining of K.B. upper from RD 0+000 to 65+000 and its allied works at a cost of Rs8265m; from RD 65+000 to 130+000 at a cost of Rs9,757m; RD130+000 to 189+000 at a cost of Rs9,913m.
The international bidder would have to enter into a joint venture with a Pakistani firm in accordance with relevant provisions of the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) bylaws. The bids would be opened in the project director’s office. The Sindh government has appointed Mukhtiar Ahmed Abro as project director.
The project was hit by irregularities and not only irrigation secretary but then caretaker law minister also intervened to get the process stopped and subsequently, the bids were cancelled by secretary Niaz Abbasi and Kotri Barrage chief engineer Haji Khan Jamali was issued a show-cause notice.
The Feeder’s lining is part of larger K-IV project for ensuring a dependable supply of around 650 million gallons per day (MGD) to Karachi from the Keenjhar Lake in Thatta. 
The K-IV is being executed by Wapda and its phase-I is supposed to be completed in October this year. With phase-I’s execution, Karachi would be getting 260 MGD from the lake.
K.B. Feeder is a perennial canal that covers an area of around 38 miles and the lining scheme was approved by Ecnec after Sindh government decided to execute it for saving water to meet Karachi’s future needs. 
As per initial plan, the lining scheme is to be executed on 50:50 basis by federal and Sindh governments. The provincial government had allowed national competitive bidding (NCB) on Oct 16, 2023, with some conditions following a request by then CE Kotri Barrage Haji Khan Jamali but it was hit by irregularities, prompting then caretaker law minister Umer Soomro being chairman of Sindh Public Procurement Regulatory Authority to raise the matter with irrigation secretary on Dec 20. 
The secretary got the bidding process stopped and decided to get it done afresh.
The canal’s lining would save around 500 cusecs of water initially in phase-I. Presently, Karachi was being provided 1200 cusecs from Kotri barrage through the canal, more than double the allocated share of 520 cusecs for Karachi.
