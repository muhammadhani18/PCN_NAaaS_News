Expressing dismay over the discontinuation of free medical treatment under the Sehat Insaf Card and the closure of panagahs for the poor by the caretaker government, Gandapur pledged their restoration under the new PTI administration.

3,ANP to protest outside provincial assembly,Aimal says his party is striving for the supremacy of democracy,"Awami National Party (ANP) on Monday announced it will hold a protest demonstration outside the K-P provincial assembly on February 28 at 2 pm. 
A press statement issued here by Bacha Khan Markaz said that the Provincial President of ANP Aimal Wali Khan has announced the demonstration which was aimed at condemning the alleged rigging in the February 8 vote.
He said ANP had been struggling for the supremacy of the constitution, democracy, and people’s rule. He appealed to the people of K-P to join ANP protest for real democracy in the country. 
Aimal directed all party officials, organizations, and other leaders to make full preparations for the protest demonstration. 
Wali said that the chief justice should act and constitute a judicial commission to probe these irregularities and rigging allegations.
“We will take legal action alongside those who were coerced into paying for desired outcomes,” he declared, denouncing the notion that the establishment could dictate the nation’s future.

“According to the constitution, they are our guardians, not rulers, and they must cease meddling in politics and democracy, focusing instead on protecting the country’s borders,” he remarked.
“We are grateful that we stand apart from the establishment, and those who sought to keep us out of parliament inadvertently propelled us back to our original roots,” he remarked. “For the past century, ANP’s political approach has evolved, yet its fundamental questions remain unchanged,” he noted.
“History bears witness to the denial of ANP’s rights since its inception, despite Bacha Khan’s efforts that compelled the British government to grant Pakhtuns the right to vote,” he added. “Within a week of Pakistan’s creation, the tragic Babra massacre in Charsadda claimed the lives of 600 innocent and unarmed Pakhtuns,” he lamented.

4,Balochistan’s 2nd snowfall of season,"Plummeting temperatures led to surge in demand for both utilities, exacerbating persistent issue of load shedding","In a scene reminiscent of a winter postcard, parts of Balochistan welcomed their second snowfall of the season on Monday, transforming the landscape into a magical winter wonderland. Areas like Kan Mehtarzai, Ziarat, Toba Kakarai, and Quetta, along with their surroundings, were blanketed in a pristine layer of snow, painting a picturesque picture.
While many residents of Quetta revelled in the chilly weather, for some, the joy was overshadowed by the challenges brought about by the unavailability of gas and electricity. The plummeting temperatures led to a surge in demand for both utilities, exacerbating the persistent issue of load shedding. Consequently, numerous individuals grappled with prolonged darkness and cold, disrupting their daily routines and causing discomfort.
The snowfall in Kan Mehtarzai and Khojak Top resulted in road blockades, prompting the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to deploy heavy machinery to ensure the smooth flow of traffic. Despite these efforts, long queues of vehicles formed due to the road closures.

Nauman Khan, a Quetta resident, shed light on the hardships posed by the snowfall. “While the scenery is breathtaking, it comes with its fair share of challenges,” he remarked. “The erratic gas and power supply make it difficult to stay warm and carry out daily tasks, especially during these harsh winter days.”
Calls have been made to authorities to promptly address the issues pertaining to gas and power supply, alleviating the burden on residents. Meanwhile, locals are urged to take necessary precautions to stay warm and safe amidst the harsh weather conditions. “WAPDA and Sui Gas should show compassion towards people during this freezing weather,” lamented Nauman Khan.
Efforts to mitigate the impact of gas and power outages are of paramount importance as the snowfall persists, ensuring that communities can withstand the winter season with resilience.
