0,CDA’s Kuri Enclave project attracts big developers,"DHA, Bahria Town, Park View submit proposals for ‘biggest housing project’; financial bids to follow technical evaluation","ISLAMABAD: In response to an advertisement by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for the development of ‘Kuri Enclave’ in Islamabad under a land-sharing formula, several renowned developers, including the Defence Housing Authority, expressed their interest in the proposed housing scheme.
In addition to the army-run authority, Bahria Town of Malik Riaz, Park View of Aleem Khan, ZM/Faisal Hills of Chaudhry Majeed, New City Paradise, AKD Group of Abdul Karim Dhedhi have submitted their proposals for the said contract.
The Kuri Enclave will be developed on 10,000 kanals and it will be the largest housing scheme of the CDA. Normally, the CDA develops its sectors on 8,000 kanals. The civic agency wants to develop this sector through a joint venture with private developers or through any institute on a plot-sharing basis.
The successful bidder will develop the said sector and it will provide developed plots to the CDA under the formula yet to be determined. These plots will be sold in the open market.

DHA, Bahria Town, Park View submit proposals for ‘biggest housing project’; financial bids to follow technical evaluation

“DHA, Bahria Town, Park View and some other big names are in the race to get this contract. After technical evaluation of their proposals, the CDA will go for financial bids,” a CDA official told Dawn.
According to the CDA advertisement, the successful bidder will execute the project of the state-of-the-art residential complex/community, comprising of residential and commercial units plots (horizontal as well as vertical) along with all facilities and amenities connected therewith. 
The successful bidder shall exclusively be responsible for the successful and timely execution of the project and undertaking and performing tasks, actions, and works as may be required.
The entity shall commence and complete the development works of the project as per the approved schedule and plan. The CDA advert further said that before the market launch of the project, all initial expenditures, investments, and finances shall be provided, incurred, and borne exclusively by the developer. However, the CDA stated that rights/ownership of land shall exclusively rest with the CDA.
The sources said the CDA had acquired land for the development of the Kuri model village decades ago but after announcing the land award it took no serious steps for its development. 
The model village was to be set up on 3,200 acres in Kuri, Majohan and Rehara revenue estates. The area falls in Zone IV.
The CDA recently collected applications from the local people to clear their pending built-up property cases to get possession of the land from them. It was decided that all the 2,700 affected people would be given compensation against their BuP claims. In September last year, the IHC after vacating stay orders on the stalled model village project had given the go-ahead to the CDA for the development of the housing scheme.

3,"Capital has ‘zero’ out-of-school children, claims report",ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Institute of Education on Tuesday launched a report on its campaign ‘Zero Out-of-School...,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Institute of Education on Tuesday launched a report on its campaign ‘Zero Out-of-School Children’ (ZOOSC), stating that more than 70,941 children have been enrolled in schools across Islamabad, bringing the number of out-of-school children in the capital to a “zero”.
The report is based on last year’s campaign launched by the education ministry in collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). Though the institute claimed there were zero out-of-school children in the federal capital, its claim stands in contrast to reality as a significant number of children can be seen in the capital doing menial labour. Additionally, the government’s figure for FY2021-22 about the out-of-school kids is about 26.2 million.
A PIE official said that the abovementioned campaign was launched in Islamabad last year on the basis of data compiled by the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). As per this data, there are around 52,000 kids in Islamabad and during the campaign “the ministry and its partners managed to enrol 70,941” out-of-school children.
Education Secretary Waseem Ajmal Chaudhry was the chief guest at the report launching ceremony. He said the successful campaign would help serve as a guide for the provinces in the future. He appreciated the field workers of the partner organisations working with the Ministry of Education for their efficient work.
He said that Islamabad was brought forward as a “model” and that there were many challenges at the start of the campaign, such as disparity in educational facilities. He said that if any work needed to be fast-tracked, the field team had a key role to play. “It is difficult to achieve such good results when there are different stakeholders.”
‘49pc girls’
He said that 49pc of the 70,000 out-of-school children brought to schools are girls, adding that two schools for transgender people have also been opened. 
PIE DG Muhammad Shahid Soroya said that Mr Ajmal gave the institute a target of bringing 50,000 children to schools within two months. “We identified 81,000 out-of-school children and managed to bring 70,000 children back to school. On the instructions of the secretary of education, we documented this campaign,” he said, adding that a research report has been prepared without any additional expenses. He said a team of officials from Sindh and south Punjab also reviewed this process and document in detail.
The research report prepared by the PIE on the campaign states that the campaign was launched in January last year. In the first phase of the campaign, the number of out-of-school children in Islamabad was determined. For this, the data of the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) was used. In the second phase, the parents of these children were contacted and convinced to send their children to schools.

4,Supreme Court restrains civic body from cutting trees in F-9 Park,Orders CDA to submit a report with explaining the number of trees recently cut and the area which has been deforested.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday restrained the Capital Development Authority (CDA) from cutting trees in Fatima Jinnah park in the capital city until the next date of hearing.
Let notice be issued to CDA and the government through the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, said an order dictated by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa after the hearing with an observation that the court had been informed that the apex court had earlier also taken notice under Article 184(3) of the Constitution with regard to illegal activities in the park in a case.
The court also ordered to issue notice to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB).
The suo motu was taken by the Supreme Court after the registrar of the Supreme Court put up a note before the three-judge committee constituted under section 2 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 to consider whether proceedings may be commenced under Article 184(3) of the Constitution or not.
The note had stated that: ‘It has been reported that a larger number of trees have been cut and there is a systematic deforestation taking place in the Fatima Jinnah Park, F-9, Islamabad. Citizens are complaining that the trees which have been cut and the ongoing deforestation is on the directions of CDA and that the Supreme Court should intervene to prevent this valuable resource of the citizens from being destroyed.’
The three-judge committee had directed that this matter be numbered as a constitution petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution and CDA and the government be arrayed as respondents besides the public at large be designated as the petitioner.
 
 

“Given the public importance of this matter and its impact on the fundamental rights of citizens of Pakistan, including rights in respect of access to public places under Article 26, which may have been undermined and as it involves deforestation and the cutting of trees which degrades the right to life under Article 9 of the Constitution as interpreted by this court, the two preconditions stipulated in Article 184(3) of the Constitution are met, said the order.
Additional Attorney General (AAG) Malik Javed Iqbal Wains who was also present in the court waived notice on behalf of the government and drew attention of the court to the Islamabad (Preservation of Landscape) Ordinance, 1966 (ordinance) and referred to the definition of ‘landscape’ in its section 2(a), which needed to be preserved as stipulated in section 4 of the ordinance.
AAG also informed the court that the park comprised entire F-9 Sector of Islamabad, and the Park was under the control and management of CDA.
The court ordered CDA to submit a report with explaining the number of trees recently cut and the area which has been deforested.
The report should also include under whose supervision the trees were being felled, on whose direction this action was taken, whether tree-cutting and deforestation were done by CDA personnel themselves or through a contractor, and if the latter, to produce a copy of the contract or agreement.
The court appointed General Secretary Press Association of Supreme Court (PAS) Imran Waseem along with President Mian Aqeel Afzal as joint commissioners under Order XXXII of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 to visit the Park and take photographs/record videos showing the area where trees have been cut and area deforested.
CDA and the security guards at the Park were also directed to cooperate with the commissioners, who will furnish their report with photographs and recordings on the next date of hearing. The fee of the commissioners will be determined later.
The court also appointed Messrs Saad Mumtaz Hashmi and Syed Hassan Ali Raza, subject to their agreement, to represent the Public. To better assist the court they may personally visit the Park with the commissioners or by themselves, the order said adding till the next date of hearing, CDA will not cut any tree or proceed with further deforestation. The case will again be taken up on March 4.

A total of 49 youths have been invited from the Saarc countries to participate in this programme, which is being held with the theme of environment.
JENESYS is a youth exchange programme between Japan and the Asia-Pacific region launched by the Japanese government that aims to promote mutual trust and understanding among the people of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region.
With a focus on the theme of environment, the invitees from the Saarc countries during their stay in Japan will be provided opportunities to learn and deepen their understanding of Japan’s economy, society, history, politics, and diplomatic relations, as well as experience Japan’s diverse culture through lectures and visits.
The Japanese embassy organised a pre-departure orientation session for the visiting youth on Tuesday to give them useful information before their departure for Japan.
While interacting with the students on the occasion, Counsellor/Head of Public Affairs Kazumasa Takane advised them to make optimum use of this opportunity and learn as much as possible about Japan during this short period, as this may become a life-changing experience for them.
“Since my arrival in Pakistan last year, I have had the opportunity to meet many young people in Pakistan and have found them very energetic, talented, and keen to learn about Japan and its culture,” Kazumasa Takane said.
He hoped that youth from Pakistan and Japan could play the role of a bridge to further promote mutual understanding and friendly relations between the two countries.
The Japanese government invites several groups of undergraduate and graduate students from Saarc countries to participate in this short-term invitation every year.

He said this in a literary session hosted by the Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) on Tuesday.
The session was attended by writers and poets from the twin cities. The Ambassador of Portugal to Pakistan, H.E. Manuel Frederico Pinheiro da Silva, also attended the session. The session was moderated by poet and author Sultan Nasir, who is also serving as Director General PAL.
Speaking to the participants, José Luís Peixoto said that writers represented their cultures in their writings and served as translators of the human situations in their societies. He said that a writer must be self-confident and brave enough to write the truth.
“However it is a fact that reality becomes more imaginative and unbelievable than fiction. There is no such thing as ‘pure fiction’ because a writer’s experiences and memories play a role when fiction is being created,” he said.
In her welcome note, Chairperson PAL Dr. Naeeiba Arif thanked José Luís Peixoto for accepting PAL’s invitation and the Ambassador for his presence. She emphasised that interactive sessions of that nature could help bridge the gap between people from different cultures and nationalities.“Literature can play a vital role for global peace, harmony and understanding,” she said.
Ambassador Manuel Frederico Pinheiro da Silva appreciated PAL’s initiative to arrange the session with the Portuguese writer.
“This event will strengthen ties between the two countries on literary front. I propose PAL to extend such efforts and also initiate projects of translations of literature of both countries,” he said.

The upgradation and renovation of Benazir Bhutto Hospital’s outdoor patients department (OPD) and psychology department started during the tenure of the interim government. Though the deadline was fixed for January 31, it took another month and now the district administration has decided to complete work by March 10.
The upgradation and renovation work of the 116-bed emergency department at BBH has already been completed at the cost of Rs55 million. The project for the upgradation of the first floor of the hospital’s OPD and the ground floor of the psychology department, which will cost Rs280 million, is currently underway.
BBH Medical Superintendent Dr Tahir Rizvi said the condition of the first floor and ground floor of the outdoor-patient department and the psychology department of the hospital had become dilapidated, and after the upgradation and renovation of these two departments, they would be able to provide better healthcare facilities to the patients.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Aamer Khattak visited the hospital and inspected the development work.
He said any kind of negligence in providing medical facilities would not be tolerated.
“Medical facilities will be ensured in light of the directions of the Punjab government,” he said.
Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema, BBH Medical Superintendent Dr Tahir Rizvi and other officials were also present on this occasion.
Mr Khattak visited various departments of the hospital, including the blood bank, triage room, emergency room, OPD, surgical ward, male and female wards, children’s ward and medicine room. He made a detailed review of the health facilities in different departments of the hospital, inquired about the progress of development work and asked the administration to complete it before March 10.

“To align with university admissions and to prevent any inconvenience to the migrating students, the forum resolved that all BISEs shall follow a uniform academic calendar by starting papers for SSC in the 1st week of March and papers for HSSC in the 1st week of April from the year 2025,” read a press release issued by the IBCC.
The meeting of the forum was held here at the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE), with national coordinator Qaiser Alam, who is also head of FBISE, in the chair.
Besides, heads of other boards, Executive Director IBCC Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah, attended the meeting, which also discussed discontinuation of choice in the question paper for students.
The forum resolved that each question in Section B and Section C may be given an alternative within the same cognitive domain and difficulty level without compromising the students learning outcomes (SLOs).
To facilitate the students in the early issuance of final certificates for SSC and HSSC, it was decided that every member board will issue final certificates within six months of the declaration of results.
Moreover, to ease the attestation of documents, it was decided to connect all BISEs/BTEs with the IBCC attestation portal for online verification of records.
The press release said that to create awareness among the youth of the country and society for tolerance, knowledge, patience, and improvement of ethical behaviour, the forum resolved to plan activities for the whole year to perform in affiliated institutions of member BISEs and decided to mark the year 2025 for following in the footsteps of the holy prophet.
The press release said that the FBISE and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Boards have performed exceptionally well in establishing their ‘question item banks’. However, there was a need to establish a ‘centralised national question item bank’ accessible to all education boards in Pakistan to ensure a standardised set of questions for uniform assessment.
The Forum has decided to establish such a repository at the IBCC level. This initiative will help in maintaining consistency in the difficulty level, format, and quality of questions across different boards, promoting fairness and equality in assessments. By using a centralised question bank, the variability in assessment content will be minimised, ensuring that students from different boards are assessed on similar knowledge and skills, making the evaluation process more equitable.

12,Two leopard cubs shifted to rehab centre in Islamabad,"Common leopards are indigenous to Pakistan – Margalla Hills and Galiyat – and the pair will remain here,  IWMB chairperson says.","ISLAMABAD: Prioritising safe rescue and rehabilitation of wild animals, two common leopard cubs have been transferred to the rescue and rehabilitation centre (old Islamabad zoo) by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Department.
On Tuesday the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) invited the press to share the news. Roughly two months old, with scruffy fur and prominent rosettes, Sultan and Neelo gave out soft snarls and growls at the cameramen. Hiding behind their two caregivers inside the cage, the male and female cubs also hesitantly approached the fence of their enclosure to sniff the cameras.
“The cubs are in good health. They are already identifying the caregivers as parents. Once hand-raised it may not be possible to release them into the wild where they may not be able to hunt and survive on their own,” IWMB Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan said.
 
 

She hinted at the sufficient space available at the rescue and rehabilitation centre where a roomy enclosure could be built for the pair. Unlike Baboo the rescued exotic male Bengal tiger who has been transferred to a vast open sanctuary in South Africa, Rina Saeed Khan ruled out the option of sending the pair abroad.
Common leopards are indigenous to Pakistan – Margalla Hills and Galiyat – and the pair will remain here, she added.
The cubs were spotted in a bush in Jabri, a village in Haripur district, by gypsies who reported the sighting to the village council, Sub-Divisional Wildlife Officer, Haripur Wildlife Department, Mohammad Awais Khan told Dawn.
“We rescued the cubs as soon as the village council reported the news. The cubs were shifted to Abottabad and later to the only rescue and rehabilitation centre, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board,” he said.
Awais Khan and his team spent two to three days talking to villagers to establish the truth. It was not clear whether their mother was killed or if she abandoned her cubs. The wildlife official was indebted to the villagers for reporting to the wildlife department and extending cooperation to its staff.
According to the IWMB, it was not uncommon for big cat mothers to abandon their cubs.
“Once abandoned, cubs can rarely be reunited with their mothers,” Rina Saeed Khan said.
The IWMB has had a workable relationship with the provincial forest and wildlife departments. The two leopard cubs were not the only wild animals shifted to the rescue and rehabilitation centre for better care.
The Sindh wildlife department transferred monkeys by train to the IWMB. Two weeks ago the board had rescued a leopard whose teeth were broken and a paw fractured. The cub was shifted from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
“Unfortunately, the cub could not be saved and died of pneumonia three days ago,” Rina Saeed Khan said.
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Senior Director Rab Nawaz told media that “sadly, most wildlife in Pakistan is no longer common, including the common leopards. They are endangered and after this its extinction”.
He said leopards fell prey to villagers and their cubs were put up for sale in the black market.
Nonetheless, the IWMB had worn team jackets with Second Chance, a group of volunteers that provide financial assistance to help rescue and rehabilitate wild animals into their natural environments.

14,‘Illegal’ upgradation of CDA officials still undecided,"ISLAMABAD: Despite Islamabad High Court (IHC)’s order issued in 2020, the chronic issue of alleged illegal...","ISLAMABAD: Despite Islamabad High Court (IHC)’s order issued in 2020, the chronic issue of alleged illegal upgradation of employees of Capital Development Authority (CDA) is still undecided. The court had directed the CDA to decide the chronic cases within six months.
During the tenures of Imtiaz Inayat Elahi and mainly during the chairmanship of Farkhand Iqbal from 2010 to 2012, the CDA had promoted hundreds of employees through so-called upgradation bypassing seniority of a large number of eligible ones. 
According to one of the official inquiries, the CDA made the upgradation and promotion on pick and choose basis benefiting some employees over others.
Interestingly, the matter was dragged in various committees since 2012 and also placed before the CDA board several times, but to no avail.
In 2020, after forming a number of inquiry committees, the CDA declared the upgradation of 43 officials illegal and de-notified them.
However, after suspending the CDA’s orders, the IHC directed the civic agency to decide the matter in six months after giving the opportunity of hearing to the officials. Since then, sources said, no serious effort has been made to decide the matter to resolve pending promotion cases of other eligible officials.
In 2021, the CDA board had formed a subcommittee to look into the issue, but the matter could not be resolved. Then in January last year, another committee was formed headed by private member of the CDA board, Dr Mohammad Ali, and comprising member finance and admin. However, this committee too has not finalised its recommendation.
Meanwhile, the matter was also discussed in a CDA board meeting in December 2023, which directed the committee to finalise its work in three months, but so far the matter is still undecided.
“Those who deserved promotion and were given it without following rules and regulations, their promotion should be declared legal to resolve this issue and those who were given many high-step promotions bypassing hundreds of other employees, their upgradation should be de-notified for the sake of justice,” said an official of CDA.
He said lingering the case was hampering promotions of a larger number of other employees, as after 2014 almost no promotion has been made in those cadres where the out-of-turn promotions were made in 2012.
In 2019, an inquiry committee looking into cases of upgrading and changing of cadres had revealed that most of the officials whose cases were examined had illegally been upgraded.
The committee in its report submitted to the then CDA chairman Amer Ali Ahmed had recommended de-notifying the illegally upgraded/re-designated cadres.
The report, (available with Dawn) states: “The committee has examined each individual case separately and given marks. The committee endorsed the previous committees’ findings in most of the cases. This committee also concluded that apart from a few cases majority of employees had been upgraded/re-designated or allowed cadre change illegally in violation of preconditions defined by the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan and the procedure laid down in the CDA Employees Service Regulations 1992.’
The report had pointed out that upgradations were made on pick and choose basis benefiting some employees over others, which was a clear violation of the principles laid down in the apex court judgement, it added.
Meanwhile, IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani in 2020 deciding petitions of the demoted officers directed the civic agency to complete the composition of its board of directors by inducting members in accordance with the CDA ordinance and then decide the representation of the demoted officers. The court had set a six-month deadline for implementation of the directions which has not been decided by the CDA.
In 2017, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had registered a criminal case against 34 officials whose upgradation and subsequent promotion were carried out in violation of the CDA rules and regulations. But later the FIR was quashed as the case did not fall in the domain of criminal offence. 
An officer of the CDA speaking to Dawn, however, said the issue was going to be settled soon as the inquiry committee headed by Dr Mohammad Ali had already conducted several meetings and now the inquiry was heading towards conclusion.

15,Under-trial murder accused shot dead in court,RAWALPINDI: An under-trial accused in a murder case was gunned down on Tuesday allegedly by his brother-in-law in ...,"RAWALPINDI: An under-trial accused in a murder case was gunned down on Tuesday allegedly by his brother-in-law in the Judicial Complex where entry of people is subject to body search and carrying weapons is strictly prohibited.
The alleged killer was taken into custody by the police and murder weapon was recovered from the accused, police said.
Police said the accused Ali Shah, who was involved in the murder of his wife in Rawat police station area was languishing in Adiala jail and was brought to the Judicial Complex for trial in the court of additional district and sessions judge on Tuesday. Police said the accused had just reached the premises of the judicial complex when his opponent (wife’s brother), who was already present there, opened fire and killed him on the spot.
However, the alleged killer was arrested by the police and a weapon was recovered from him.
Since the entry in the Judicial Complex was subject to body search, how the accused entered the Judicial Complex with weapons in the presence of police has raised questions about the security of the complex.
City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani has taken notice of the incident and sought a report from the Superintendent of Pothohar Police. Khan’s sister was murdered in 2023 in Rawat and the recent killing is a sign of enmity, but an inquiry is being conducted into the incident.
