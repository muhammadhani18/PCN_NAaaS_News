Emeritus Professor and former UVAS VC Dr Naseem Ahmed announced the success at Pattoki campus on Tuesday, calling it the culmination of research and collaboration across departments. The process involved ovum pickup from pure Holstein Friesian specimens at the TRDF, followed by UVAS embryology lab’s maturation, fertilisation and culture of oocytes. Subsequently, the resulting embryo was transferred to a synchronised recipient, resulting in a successful pregnancy and the birth of a healthy calf.
Department of Theriogenology and Embryology Chairman Dr Irfanur Rehman congratulated the embryology team, their guide Prof Dr Amjad Riaz, faculty members Dr Ali Husnain, Dr Talha Ashraf and Dr Muhammad Yaseen, postgraduate students Dr Melaad and Muhammad Abdullah, researchers, technicians and staff.
Prof Naseem Ahmad said locally producing pure breed Holstein Friesian animals via IVEP not only lowers the expense of importing animals or embryos but also contributes to the nation’s sustainability while maintaining genetic integrity and milk production levels.

1,Govt restores LDA’s authority to approve housing schemes,The LDA has regained its powers of according approval to the housing schemes and land-use conversion cases.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Tuesday ordered the authorities concerned to hand over the record pertaining to private housing schemes and land-use conversion in the districts of Kasur, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib to the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) after the respective district administrations failed to do so despite directions, reminders etc.
With this directive, the LDA has regained its powers of according approval to the housing schemes, land-use conversion cases that, in the tenure of the PTI government, were taken back through an ordinance empowering deputy commissioners to approve such cases being heads of the  local governments, Dawn has learnt.
The caretaker provincial cabinet in its 35th meeting on Jan 10 decided that the LDA would continue to perform its functions of land use and approval of private housing schemes within the Lahore division till establishment of the elected local governments.
“Therefore, the decision of the cabinet shall be complied with and record pertaining to land use and private housing schemes be transferred to the LDA under intimation to this department,” seeks the Local Government & Community Development Department in a letter to the administrators and chief officers of the defunct local governments of the Lahore division.
According to an official source in the LDA, though the powers were considered transferred ultimately to the authority after non-enactment of an April 2021 ordinance titled “Lahore Development Authority (Amendment) ordinance-2021”, the record of land use and private housing schemes was not handed over to LDA and the administrators kept giving approvals to the housing schemes, land use conversion cases etc unlawfully despite knowing about the facts.“
In this way, a number of housing schemes were approved and developed in the non-designated areas that, later, caused various civic and legal issues,“ the official requesting anonymity maintained.
He said despite reminders, administrators of the aforementioned districts failed to handover the relevant record to LDA.
LESCO: The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) during 167-day operation, so far, has detected a total of 57,806 connections from where the customers were pilfering electricity in all its circles of five districts (Lahore, Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, Kasur and Okara).

“Instead, an independent complaint cell has been established under the supervision of the chief secretary to address such concerns in a fair and impartial manner,” he added.

For this purpose, the NAB chairman had also visited commerce chambers to ensure support and cooperation of the businessmen. 
Addressing a cheque distributing ceremony worth Rs1.67bn to the affectees of the Pak Arab Housing scandal on Tuesday, Mr Nasir affirmed that all cases relating to cheating public matters were the top priority of NAB. 
He ensured maintaining the self-respect of every respondent of NAB. “Disgracing any suspect will not be tolerated anymore. NAB will not take any kind of action on any anonymous complaint,” he added. 
NAB Lahore Director General Amjad Majeed Aulakh said the bureau had distributed Rs7.5bn among affectees of various scams during the last six months. He said NAB Lahore had recovered more than Rs35bn since inception and it had materialised the biggest plea bargain in Eden Scam worth Rs16bn from which Rs7bn had been disbursed among affectees.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry was hearing the prosecution appeal when the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) President Parvez Elahi’s wife Qaisera Elahi, son Rasikh Elahi and daughter-in-law Zara Elahi made their appearance.
However, Tehreem Elahi, the wife of Moonis, and Saira Anwar did not appear before the court.
At this, the bench issued bailable warrants for their arrest, directing them to furnish surety bonds and appear on March 18.
A trial court had last year confirmed the pre-arrest bail of the Elahi’s family members in the money laundering case lodged by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The prosecution filed the appeal before the high court for the cancellation of their bail.
The FIA alleged that the sons and the daughters-in-law of former chief minister Elahi committed money laundering through a low cadre employee of the Punjab Assembly.
It said the suspects used bank accounts of Qaiser Iqbal Bhatti, a peon of the assembly, to launder money.
The agency said unexplained transactions of millions of rupees had been traced in the accounts of the peon and the children of Mr Elahi. It alleged that the assets of the peon had been found beyond his known sources of income.
The FIA said the inquiry in question had no relation with any previous probe as it had been initiated against a government employee, the assembly’s peon.
Moonis has been declared a proclaimed offender in the case.
Jail trial of Ejaz: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday directed a provincial government’s lawyer to furnish complete record of a notification regarding jail trial of May 9 cases against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Senator Ejaz Chaudhry.
Hearing a petition by the senator, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Aalia Neelum asked an additional advocate general whether the trial court had asked the government for a jail trial in the cases.  
The judge observed that the language of the notification reflects as if someone sought security from the government.
The law officer sought time to present complete documents relating to the notification.
The bench allowed the request and directed the government’s lawyer to submit the record on March 7.  
Earlier, Advocate Ali Ashfaq, the counsel for the senator, pleaded that the provincial government with ulterior motives approved jail trials in the FIRs relating to the May 9 protests only to harass the suspects.
He argued that the jail trial cannot be termed open and fair as the concept of jail trial is against the fundamentals of due process of law.
He said a jail trial is a violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to fair trial and due process of law.  
The counsel stated that the trial court also approved the decision of the government and started the jail trial against the petitioner in two cases of attacks on the Jinnah House and Shadman police station.
He asked the court to set aside the decision of the provincial government and the trial court for being unconstitutional.  
The PTI senator is on judicial remand in several cases of the May 9 riots registered against the leaders and workers of the party.
