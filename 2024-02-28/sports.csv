0,Traffic police likely to have modified uniform,"New uniforms to enhance aesthetics, comfort, weather resilience","The old-aged white uniform worn by Sindh traffic police may undergo significant modifications to enhance aesthetics, comfort, and weather resilience. 
Inspector General of Sindh Police, Riffat Mukhtar Raja, visited the Textile Engineering Institute at Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET) in Jamshoro district on Tuesday to explore potential upgrades.
MUET Chairman, Prof Dr Zeeshan Khatri, provided a comprehensive briefing to the IGP on the recommended fabric for the new uniform. 
Dr Khatri mentioned that the fabrication process for sample production would require a month or a two. 
The Sindh police intend to issue tenders to select vendors for fabric manufacturing. The university will contribute engineering expertise, while one or more private vendors will handle the fabric production.

Dr Khatri noted that while the green color used by the Punjab police offers heat absorption benefits, it struggles with color retention after repeated washing. 
Initially, earth tones are being considered for the uniform fabric, with varying thickness for shirts and trousers, pending laboratory tests and approvals.
Addressing students at the varsity, IGP Raja emphasised the importance of academic excellence, warning that future job prospects may favor high-performing students. 
He lamented the societal trend where government service is often pursued for its perceived power and social status, rather than a commitment to public welfare, attributing this mindset to colonial legacies that persist in the state system.

6,Kamal’s leaked audio goes viral on social media,"Kamal emphasises that allegations made by PPP regarding fake mandates weren't new, had been publicly aired on tv","The audio recording of Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) Deputy Convener Mustafa Kamal's briefing during the coordination committee's meeting of the party has attracted widespread attention on social media. 
In the recording, Kamal has discussed the interactions between MQM-P and PML-N regarding the formation of a coalition government. 
According to Kamal, PML-N summoned the MQM-P delegation late at night, seemingly coercing them into a meeting. 
However, the PML-N was reportedly uncooperative during the meeting, which lasted for 45 minutes before they abruptly ended it, citing another meeting with PPP.
During the meeting, PML-N allegedly disclosed that PPP had accused MQM-P mandate of being entirely fraudulent, contrasting with other parties whose mandates were purportedly only partially fake. 
Furthermore, PPP purportedly advocated for excluding MQM-P from the coalition, asserting that together with PML-N, they had adequate seats to form a government.

Following the circulation of the audio, Mustafa Kamal released a video statement acknowledging its authenticity. He clarified that the remarks made in the recording were part of his briefing to the coordination committee, as he was involved in the negotiation committee of the party and had engaged in multiple discussions with PML-N. 
Kamal emphasised that the allegations made by PPP regarding fake mandates were not new and had been publicly aired on television. 
He highlighted suspicions within the party about the individuals aligned with MQM London infiltrating the party's ranks, suggesting that the leak of the audio confirmed these suspicions.
