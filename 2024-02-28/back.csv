0,CAA snubs reports of grounding pilots,Authority also defends local airlines hiring foreign aviators,"The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) clarified on Tuesday that no pilot had been grounded, nor had the issuance or renewal of their licenses stalled, refuting media reports.

The CAA stated that the process of issuing or renewing licenses for pilots, in accordance with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Act, 2023, was ongoing and followed strict rules.

Contrary to media reports, the CAA denied blocking licenses for 130 Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) pilots, which would have grounded them.

The Aircraft Owners and Operators Association (AOOA) expressed concerns over the Pakistan Civil Aviation Act, 2023, arguing that shifting the authority to issue licenses from the director to the director general of the CAA was a misstep. This change allegedly left 130 PIA pilots without licenses and unemployed.

It maintained that because of the new law, the CAA was unable to issue licences to 130 PIA pilots, rendering them unemployed.

The association appealed to the federal aviation minister to take notice of the issue as the PIA was already facing a severe shortage of pilots. It pushed the government to make changes in the new law.

The AOOA further criticised the hiring practices of local airlines, especially their preference for foreign pilots over hundreds of local and unemployed ones.

It continued that this practice not only sidelined hundreds of Pakistani pilots but also resulted in substantial financial implications, as foreign ones were reportedly receiving salaries ranging between $9,500 and $15,000 in the form of dollars.

The association noted that this trend resulted in a significant outflow of dollars from the nation, urging local airlines to employ domestic pilots.

It also alleged that these foreign pilots were benefiting from tax exemptions -- a matter it suggested should warrant scrutiny from the Federal Board of Revenue and intervention by the government.

The CAA in its statement further clarified that local airlines hired foreign pilots and this was permissible under the authority’s rules.

These foreign pilots receive their work visas after clearance from the interior ministry and are subsequently issued with a verification certificate.

The authority added that the endorsements of the foreign pilots were renewed as per the rules at the request of the airlines.

2,LHC in spotlight in Bhutto case reference,CJ says trial seems to be a fixed match,"The Supreme Court was informed on Tuesday that the five judges of the Lahore High Court (LHC) bench that originally awarded the death penalty to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto should not have sat on that bench, which was formed only to award the punishment.

A nine-member larger bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa heard the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto presidential reference.

During the hearing, amicus curie, Justice (retd) Manzoor Malik, said that there was no precedence for a murder case trial in a high court.

The late Bhutto was convicted in the murder case of Muhammad Khan Kasuri by the LHC over a year after the toppling of his government by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq. Later, Bhutto’s appeal against his conviction was rejected by the Supreme Court in a 4-3 split verdict.

Bhutto’s Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) always contended that the party founder and the country’s first elected prime minister was falsely convicted and hanged.

During the PPP government from 2008-13, the then president sent a reference to the apex court to review the case and acquit Bhutto.

At the outset of the hearing on Tuesday, Malik gave arguments on the criminal side of the case.
He said that then acting LHC chief justice, Maulvi Mushtaq Hussain, who headed the five-member bench, had expressed personal grudges against Bhutto and made it part of the order, but he did not leave the bench.

Sitting on the bench despite a personal grudge was something that was more than malice, he continued. The remaining four judges, who signed the order, should also not have sat on the bench.
In fact, Malik said, they sat on the bench to punish Bhutto.

According to Malik, a crime punishable by death could not be tried in a high court.

He added that the high court had never conducted a direct trial of a murder case in India.

On that, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that even martial law could not be imposed there.

Giving the history of Bhutto’s case, Malik said that after the investigation, the case was shelved in Oct 1976 on the order of a magistrate. However, after the declaration of martial law, the investigations started again without any written order.

On Sept 11, 1977, an incomplete challan was submitted in which seven accused, including Bhutto, were nominated. Later, accused Ghulam Hussain and Masood Mahmood were pardoned and made approvers, and on Sept 18, 1977, those two names were removed from the complete challan.

Later, Malik continued, the five remaining accused, including Bhutto, were tried and sentenced to death. Bhutto was charged with conspiracy to murder, although the complainant had not mentioned any conspiracy.

Meanwhile, the investigation of the murder case also started, and an incomplete challan of the murder case was submitted to a magistrate's court, which sent it to the sessions court on the same day, while a request to transfer the case to the high court for trial was submitted the next day.

Malik said that Maulvi Mushtaq approved the application without giving notice to the parties and sought the record of the case.

Cleverly, the judges who heard the petition of the complainant were not included in the trial bench because one of the judges had approved Bhutto's bail, he added.

During the hearing, Chief Justice Isa remarked that the manner in which the case was tried seemed to be a fixed match. At one point, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood said that the execution of Bhutto was illegal, asking how four Supreme Court judges could confirm the decision of five LHC judges.

During the hearing, Ahmad Raza Kasuri said that the Supreme Court judges who heard the Bhutto case were no longer alive and their reputation was being damaged by the ongoing proceedings. He said that notice should be issued to his family.

Chief Justice Isa said that the court proceedings were being shown live and that anyone could become a party to the case. Addressing Kasuri, Justice Masood said that if he wished to defend those judges, he could. The case will be heard again on Wednesday (today).

3,"Pakistan needs to do more against human trafficking, says US diplomat",Andrew Schofer reiterates US mission’s commitment to supporting efforts against this ‘critical human rights issue’," 
Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Islamabad has said that Pakistan needs to do more in the fight against human trafficking.

Speaking at the “International Conference on Combating Trafficking and Bonded Labor of Women and Girls in Pakistan”, Andrew Schofer, however, did acknowledge that Islamabad has made progress against human trafficking.

“The challenging reality of human trafficking is that criminals exploit many systems of communication, finance, transportation, and commerce – all of which were originally designed for the collective public good,” he was quoted as saying in a press statement issued by the US Embassy in Islamabad.

“Traffickers, however, constantly evolve their networks to take advantage of emerging technologies and migratory trends. They use the same tools that are essential to connecting and enriching our global community for their transnational criminal activities,” said Schofer.

He emphasised leveraging technology to better address the nexus between finance and human trafficking and better detect online exploitation.

“By sharing information and resources, we can better equip front-line stakeholders to track and respond to evolving trafficking trends. By improving investigations and prosecutions of trafficking cases, we can bring more perpetrators of these crimes to justice. And by partnering with survivors, we can better establish trauma-informed anti-trafficking policies and strategies,” said the US diplomat.

Schofer maintained that the US mission in Pakistan is ""committed to supporting"" the country's efforts in addressing this critical human rights issue. “While we welcome the progress made in the fight against human trafficking, there is more work to be done.”

4,"‘Fair’ polls exemplify democratic tradition, Qazi tells UN body",Foreign secy says millions freely exercised their fundamental right to vote,"Pakistan’s ongoing peaceful transition of power following the Feb 8 “fair” election demonstrated the strength of the country’s democratic tradition and values, Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi said.
“Tens of millions of Pakistani citizens freely exercised their fundamental right to vote,” Qazi told the high-level segment of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s 55th session which began in Geneva on Monday.
Pakistan, he said, was a staunch supporter in promoting universal respect for human rights, and remains a strong voice for protection, and indivisibility of all human rights.
“We have always endeavoured to foster dialogue, mutual understanding, and consensus at the Council,” the foreign secretary added.
Pakistan, he said, had also contributed to the 47-member council’s work in areas of social and economic rights; religious intolerance; disinformation; rights of children, older persons and persons with disabilities; and the frontier issue of emerging technologies.
Despite many exogenous challenges, the foreign secretary said, “Our investment in strengthening social safety nets and improving standards of education and health continue.” An independent media and a strong civil society enrich Pakistan’s human rights discourse domestically, he added.
“A few weeks ago, despite serious threat of foreign sponsored terrorism, Pakistan successfully held a peaceful and fair election. The peaceful transition of power, which is under way, demonstrates the strength of our democratic tradition and values which are essential to the enjoyment of civil and political rights,” he told delegates.
“At the same time, we are cognisant that promotion of human rights is a journey, which we are fully committed to pursue for progress and prosperity of our people,” he added.
In his remarks, the foreign secretary reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the council establish a Commission of Inquiry into the Indian occupation forces’ human rights abuses and atrocities in Kashmir, and also an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza.
In Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), he said, “India’s settler colonial project continues in full swing in breach of UN Charter, Security Council resolutions and international law.”
Pointing out that rubber-stamping by the Indian Supreme Court in December of India’s unlawful actions of August 5, 2019 was a serious travesty of justice, Qazi said that political and demographic engineering of the occupied territory was being carried out by the world’s self-professed largest democracy through an outsized military presence and draconian laws.
“In doing so, India continues to systematically violate every single basic human right of Kashmiri people,” he said, referring to arbitrary arrests, torture, summary executions, confiscation of properties, destruction of homes and excessive surveillance that had been inflicted upon the brave Kashmiris.
“Freedom of assembly, expression, and religion has been outlawed; and political parties banned.
Kashmiri political leaders, journalists and human rights activists remain incarcerated, and some face death penalties under fabricated cases. Kashmiri women and children suffer several layers of institutionalised discrimination, abuse and violence,” Qazi said.
“We urge the Council to act on the recommendations of the earlier two Kashmir reports and establish a Commission of Inquiry,” he added.
“We also ask India to grant unhindered access to global media, civil society groups, and UN human rights mechanisms to the occupied territory.”

5,PM says blaming state for missing persons not justified,Kakar tells IHC an armed resistance is going on in Balochistan,"Caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar told the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday that taking the entire state as criminal because of the missing persons issue was not correct, stressing that an armed resistance was going on in Balochistan.

Kakar appeared in the IHC on court orders during the hearing of a case pertaining to the missing Baloch students. The court was informed that 11 more students had been recovered, while only four had yet to be traced.

During the hearing, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani remarked that when people went missing, the state of Pakistan was blamed. The judge added that people had reached their homes because of the efforts of the authorities. However, he also said that state institutions were not above the law.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan presented a report about the recovery of missing Baloch students. He said that among the 59 missing students, 11 more had been recovered, and the authorities concerned were tracing the remaining four.

Among the 11 more recovered students, AGP Awan said that two of them were with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, while nine faced cases against them and were in the custody of the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD).

Prime Minister Kakar told the court that the country faced an armed struggle in Balochistan, where paramilitary forces had been deployed as counter-terrorism agencies. He also said that when the people were asked about the missing persons, they would present 5,000 names.

Kakar recalled that a former chief justice [of the Balochistan High Court] was martyred while offering prayers in Balochistan. “People were burnt alive on a bus on the Coastal Highway, but no one remembered the violation of human rights at that time,” he said.

“People were taken out of buses and asked their names, and if someone’s name was Chaudhry or Gujjar, they were killed, but still, they said that there should not be profiling of students on a linguistic basis. People have the right to live. The Constitution requires its citizens to be unconditionally loyal to the state,” he added.

Kakar also told the court that 90,000 people were martyred in acts of terrorism, but not even 90 people were punished. Justice

Kayani replied that it was also a failure of the state institutions that they could not prosecute the perpetrators. He emphasised that if there was a lacuna in the law, it needed to be improved. The law should be followed,” he continued. Courts have also given punishments to very hardened terrorists, and no court would protect the non-state actors.

Justice Kayani told the prime minister that there was no need to go to Balochistan because a lot had been seen in the federal capital. He then pointed to a senior journalist in the courtroom, saying that he was picked up in Islamabad in broad daylight.

Advocate Iman Mazari told the court that when it came to the missing persons issue, it was linked to terrorists, which became very painful for the families of the missing persons. She said that the impression that it was a propaganda against the state was not correct.

There were reports from the commission on missing persons that institutions were involved in enforced disappearances, she told the court.

The judge said that the court would direct the questions to the committee of intelligence agencies in the future.

On that, Kakar said this was the executive’s domain, adding that the government had challenged the order for the formation of the committee, comprising heads of three premier intelligence agencies.

Later, the court sought details of the cases against the persons in CTD custody and adjourned the hearing.

6,PTI fields Amir Dogar for NA speaker slot,Imran picks Junaid Khan for deputy speakership," 
PTI leader Omer Ayub announced on Tuesday that party founder Imran Khan has officially nominated Amir Dogar for the crucial position of National Assembly speaker, with Junaid Khan selected for the role of deputy speaker.
The announcement came following a series of meetings between Ayub, other party leaders, and the incarcerated PTI chief at Adiala Jail.
Amir Dogar, who previously served as the chief whip in the National Assembly during the PTI government, and also held the position of special assistant to the prime minister on political affairs under Imran Khan's leadership, emerged victorious in the February 8 general elections from Multan’s NA-149 constituency.
Meanwhile, Junaid Khan, Imran’s nominee for the NA deputy speaker, secured victory in the polls from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district.
Ayub said Junaid has proven his allegiance despite facing numerous challenges and expressed optimism about the PTI's future, asserting, “God willing, the PTI will form governments.”
Peaceful protests
Ayub also announced that the PTI is set to organise peaceful protests nationwide on Saturday, March 2, in response to alleged rigging in the February 8 elections.
Highlighting concerns about the election process, Ayub stated, “The massive rigging in the polls […] the way several returning officers reduced our seats through Form-45s, we will protest against this along with several other parties.”
Claiming unprecedented rigging in the history of Pakistan, Ayub asserted that the public mandate was stolen.
He cited an incident in Lodhran where a seat was allegedly snatched during recounting, pledging to fight against such injustices through legal means, protests in assemblies, and mobilising public support.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser stressed the party's commitment to ensuring free and fair elections, stating, “We have a one-point agenda that whenever elections are held in the country, they should be free and fair.”
He asserted that the party refused to accept decisions made behind closed doors.
Qaiser urged the public to participate in the PTI’s peaceful protest on Saturday and assured that the party would formulate its strategy after gathering concerns regarding the general elections across the board.
He further announced that a decision regarding the swearing-in process would be reached during the parliamentary party meeting scheduled for Wednesday (today).
Criticising Maryam Nawaz's appointment as chief minister, he questioned the credibility of her ascension, stating, ""Who will believe her legitimacy? People were forcibly gathered.""
Reiterating their commitment to a lawful and constitutional struggle, he appealed to the public to engage in peaceful protests.

8,ECP reserves verdict on Nawaz's NA-15 Mansehra election plea,"PML-N Quaid’s counsel demands re-election, while PTI’s Babar asks ECP to refer case to tribunal","The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday reserved its judgment on PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif's plea challenging the election victory of PTI candidate from NA-15 Mansehra.
The PML-N leader's counsel Javed Jadoon as well as PTI-backed candidate Shahzada Gustashap Khan's counsel, Babar Awan, completed their arguments on the case.
A two-member bench of the ECP, headed by Sindh member Nisar Durrani, conducted the hearing.
During the hearing, Nawaz’s counsel argued that they received a copy of the returning officer’s (RO) response on Monday evening, claiming that they did not receive Form-45 of 123 polling stations.
The ECP Sindh member asked Jadoon if there was a stay on the release of final election results. ""Yes,"" the counsel replied.
The counsel stated, “The ballot boxes were not sealed. This constituency witnessed greater rigging and vote-tampering than in Daska.""
The RO was booked in the case but he fell sick and vanished after being shifted to the hospital, he alleged, adding that the counting of votes continued till 4am the next morning.
Nawaz's lawyer termed the election ""unconstitutional, illegal, and against election rules"". ECP Punjab member Babar Hassan Bharwana inquired if he thought the same regarding the elections held across the country.
The PML-N lawyer responded, “I am only talking about the irregularities in the elections held in NA-15.” He urged the ECP members to order a re-election.
PTI candidate's counsel Awan argued, “If the seals of the bags were broken, then the matter should be sent to the tribunal for investigation. The FIR registered against the RO is not enough evidence. The ECP is neither a court nor a tribunal, it cannot record testimonies.""

Awan added, “There were no major complaints regarding the election till 1am on February 8.”
He said Nawaz lost the seat as per the results of Feb 8.
“The ECP has formed tribunals, the matter regarding NA-15 should be sent to a tribunal,” Babar said.
The electoral watchdog reserved its verdict on the matter following the completion of arguments from both parties.
On Monday, the ECP observed that it would issue an interim order regarding the stay on releasing the final results for NA-15 Mansehra.
The hearing was chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja. The CEC observed that the ECP could not continue the stay for an indefinite period.
Earlier, PTI-backed candidate’s counsel Babar Awan argued, “We won with a margin of 25,000 votes.”
He maintained that, as per the law, a recounting of votes cannot be ordered on such a huge margin.
Addressing Nawaz’s lawyer, the CEC said the watchdog will lift the stay, asking the former to present arguments on the case after receiving the RO’s report.
Last week, the ECP dismissed Nawaz’s application to stop the notification of the results of NA-15 Mansehra, with orders to refile it.
A two-member bench, headed by CEC Raja, heard the complaints of candidates who had challenged the election results.
Nawaz’s lawyer did not appear before the bench and the NA-15 Mansehra RO while submitting his report to the commission said the constituency’s result had been compiled as per Form-45.
The ECP bench rejected the PML-N supremo’s application to stop the notification of the successful candidate, directing his lawyer to file it again.
Three days after the Feb 8 elections, the ECP had directed the RO to not issue the final result for NA-15 Mansehra, after Nawaz challenged it.

9,COAS commends ASP’s heroic intervention,Shehrbano honoured for saving woman from mob attack,"Assistant Superintendent of Police Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi visited Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarters on Wednesday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.
As per the statement, the meeting centred on her courageous intervention in a volatile situation at Ichra Bazaar in Lahore on February 26, 2024, where she successfully rescued a woman wearing a dress with Arabic calligraphy printed on it from a mob attack in Lahore.
In praising ASP Shehrbano, the COAS commended her selfless devotion to duty and emphasised the importance of acknowledging the vital role played by Pakistani women in all aspects of life. “Since independence, Pakistani women have distinguished themselves at home and abroad by virtue of their talent, tenacity, and commitment,” he noted.
Highlighting the significance of women in Pakistani society, the army chief remarked, “An invaluable part of Pakistan’s society and their respect is enshrined in our religion as well as our social ethos.” He urged for recognition of women and their invaluable contributions to the nation.
The COAS took the opportunity to stress the importance of social harmony and the necessity for a nationwide consensus on curbing intolerance.
He advocated for the rule of law and discouraged resorting to vigilantism when legal avenues exist for addressing concerns and grievances. Arbitrary actions based on hearsay undermine the societal outlook,” Gen Munir stated, reinforcing Islam’s eternal message of kindness and benevolence.
Expressing gratitude for the sacrifices made by law enforcement agencies, the army chief appreciated their efforts in ensuring the safety and security of Pakistani citizens.


ASP Shehr Bano Naqvi, who saved a young woman wearing a dress with Arabic calligraphy printed on it from a mob attack in Lahore, on Monday said that the incident took place due to “mere confusion” and “miscommunication”.
Talking to reporters, the police official refused to reveal the woman’s identity. She further stated that the calligraphy on the woman’s clothes did not bear Quranic verses.
“The word written [on the clothes] is doing the rounds on social media […] the meaning of the word is literally sincerity, love, goodness, life, humanity,” she said, adding that the dress belonged to a brand based in a foreign Muslim country.
To another question, ASP Shehr Bano said the entire incident began when a man in the locality went up to the woman — who was in the shop along with her husband — and told her to change her clothes.
“The woman asked why should she change and during that heated argument, considering it a religious matter, people started gathering.
“So, the situation unfolded because of mere confusion, miscommunication, lack of verification, and playing on mob psychology,” the official said.
A potentially calamitous situation was averted in Lahore thanks to the resolute intervention of a policewoman from the Punjab Police.
Newly-elected Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif honoured Shehr Bano, recognising her exceptional courage and astuteness.
Maryam emphasised that the policewoman's timely intervention averted a potential tragedy, underscoring the critical importance of her actions.

Expressing gratitude to ASP Shehr Bano, Maryam remarked, ""We take immense pride in your valour.""
Despite facing intense pressure and challenging circumstances, the CM-elect said that Shehr Bano upheld the principles of justice and compassion, maintaining the dignity of law and humanity.
Meanwhile, in an interview with BBC, she recounted the intense moments outside a restaurant in Punjab's capital. “Had I not screamed and had I not convinced the crowd that we will do something about it, it would have turned nastier… Thank God,” Gulberg Circle ASP Shehr Bano Naqvi remarked.
This courageous officer found herself at the forefront of a rapidly escalating confrontation when a misunderstanding led the crowd to accuse a woman of blasphemy. The woman's dress had the word “Halwa” printed in Arabic letters on it, meaning “beautiful or sweet” in Arabic.
Displaying remarkable presence of mind and bravery, Shehr Bano swiftly took charge of the situation, preventing it from spiralling into tragedy.
Her decisive actions have garnered widespread praise, with the chief of Punjab Police Dr Usman Anwar advocating for her to be honoured with an award for her exemplary courage.
In the face of imminent danger, Shehr Bano's steadfastness not only safeguarded the lives of those involved but also prevented potential chaos and violence.
""It was a critical moment. I had to act swiftly to ensure the safety of the woman and prevent any harm from coming to her,"" Shehr Bano stated, emphasising the urgency of the situation.
The policewoman, along with her colleagues, managed to escort the woman to safety amidst the growing crowd. Videos circulated on social media depict the tense atmosphere, with Shehr Bano seen negotiating with the crowd, trying to restore order amidst chants for the woman to remove her attire.
""It was a tense situation, but we had to maintain control and ensure the safety of everyone involved,"" Shehr Bano added, highlighting the challenges faced by law enforcement in such high-pressure scenarios.
The situation turned ugly after someone alleged that the girl’s dress was bearing Quranic verses.
However, some shopkeepers defended the girl and sheltered her in a shop, telling the mob it was just an Arabic calligraphy print.
