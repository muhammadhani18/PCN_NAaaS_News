BARCELONA: Girona’s Braz­ilian winger Savio scored twice in added time to help the hosts beat Rayo Vallecano 3-0 in torrential rain on Monday and lift the season’s surprise La Liga package back to second place in the standings.
After two consecutive losses, Girona got back on track and now have 59 points, six behind Real Madrid and two ahead of third-placed Barcelona.
The season’s early pacesetters, Girona were unbeaten in 15 successive league games until a 4-0 thrashing at Real Madrid and a 3-2 loss away to Athletic Bilbao that provided a reality check for the Catalans’ lofty title ambitions.
On Monday, they dominated possession against Rayo but struggled to find the net on a surface that deteriorated in the downpour, creating one shot on target in the first half.
Girona’s Ukraine forward Artem Dovbyk, the third highest scorer in La Liga this season with 14 goals, missed three close-range chances but they broke the deadlock with a first time effort by his compatriot Viktor Tsygankov in the 52nd minute.
The visitors were reduced to 10 men when Pep Chavarria was sent off in the 76th after getting two yellow cards in quick succession and jet-heeled Savio made the most of two quick counter attacks to work his magic, striking twice in a four minute spell to wrap up the points for the Catalan side.
“The scoring does not reflect what the match was like, because it was evenly matched,” Girona manager Michel told DAZN. “However, I’m glad that we’ve regained second place. 
We’re once again the top scorers in La Liga. These are data we like and make us want to remain the same until the end of the season.”
Girona have now scored 57 times in 26 matches, one more than Barcelona and three goals ahead of Real Madrid.

1,Biennial FIFA series of friendly games to start in March,ZURICH: FIFA are launching a new series of friendly matches in one location during the international window called...,"ZURICH: FIFA are launching a new series of friendly matches in one location during the international window called the FIFA Series, with a pilot project kicking off in four countries next month, world football’s governing body said on Monday.
Although there are no trophies or prize money, the series is designed to benefit national teams that do not have the opportunity to play teams from other confederations, with FIFA set to cover travel costs.
A soft launch of the FIFA Series will take place from March 18-26 at four locations — Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Azerbaijan and Sri Lanka. Four teams will be based in one location and will play two matches each.
“Some countries have never played teams outside their confederations,” Elk­han Mammadov, FIFA’s Reg­ional Member Associ­ations Director for Europe, said. “They can gain competitive experience playing teams outside their own confederation, pla­ying tea­ms with a completely different style of play.
“Currently we have 20 teams for the pilot edition. For the 2026 edition we hope to have many more.”
Saudi Arabia will host two groups although the hosts themselves will not be involved in the matches, which are designed to benefit teams that have never qualified for the World Cup.
“The next World Cup [in 2026] will have 48 teams which means you may have many member associations who never played in a World Cup,” said Kenny Jean-Marie, FIFA’s Chief Mem­ber Associations Officer.
“They may arrive in the US, Mexico or Canada with no international experience outside their continent.”
Mammadov said they are currently working on fixing television broadcast deals for the Series while they will also look to stream matches on the FIFA+ platform.
He added there were no disagreements with confederations regarding scheduling these tournaments as they were being played during the international break.
“We’ve started discussions with high-ranked teams and they hope to play and even host the next edition in March 2026. There is interest to host,” he said.
With FIFA only facilitating and not organising the tournaments, Mammadov said they were inviting member associations with their own sponsors to sponsor the Series.

2,Dybala hat-trick lifts Roma as Lazio slip-up  in Tuscany,ROME: Paulo Dybala scored his first hat-trick in a AS Roma jersey in a 3-2 win over Torino in Serie A on Monday to...,"ROME: Paulo Dybala scored his first hat-trick in a AS Roma jersey in a 3-2 win over Torino in Serie A on Monday to keep the capital city side’s Champions League ambitions alive.
But Lazio stuttered in Tuscany, missing a chance to close the gap on their city rivals with a 2-1 defeat at Fiorentina.
Roma are sixth with 44 points, four points off Bol­ogna who occupy the final Champions League berth.
Fiorentina move up to seventh, three points behind Roma after overtaking Lazio, who drop to eighth spot.
England defender Chris Smalling got his first start for Roma in nearly six months.
But former Juventus forward Dybala was 
in sparkling form days after the Romans advanced past Feyenoord into the Europa League last 16.
“The talent of the champion came out. Players like Paulo are decisive and for me they should never be questioned,” said Roma coach Daniele De Rossi. “We knew that it would be tough after the hard work on Thursday.”
Dybala got his opening goal from the penalty spot three minutes before the break in a tight game in the Stadio Olimpico.
Duvan Zapata revived Torino hopes two minutes later, heading into goal to keep the visitors in the game at the half-time whistle.
Dybala once again came to the rescue, curling in a second after 57 minutes, completing his hat-trick 12 minutes later following good work from substitute Romelu Lukaku.
For Dybala it was the seventh hat-trick of his career, and first since October 2018 in the Champions League for Juventus.
Dean Huijsen inadvertently turned the ball into his own net with two minutes to go setting up a tense finale.
But De Rossi’s side held on for back-to-back wins after their painful 4-2 defeat to leaders Inter Milan two weeks ago.
“Of course we could have suffered less, there are games to kill off, we could have managed it a little better until the end, but I’m satisfied, I saw good things,” said De Rossi.
Meanwhile, Fiorentina came from behind to see of Lazio despite rattling the woodwork three times and missing a penalty.
Luis Alberto put Lazio ahead after 45 minutes but Michael Kayode and Giacomo Bonaventura hit back with two goals in an eight minute spree after the hour mark.

COVENTRY City’s Ellis Simms shoots to score against Maidstone United during their FA Cup fifth-round match at the Coventry Building Society Arena.—Reuters

 
COVENTRY: Ellis Sim­ms ruined Maidstone’s FA Cup fairytale as his hat-trick inspired Coventry’s 5-0 win against the non-league giant-killers in the fifth round on Monday.
Simms struck three times in the first half and Fabio Tavares bagged a late double to take second tier Coventry into the quarter-finals for the first time since 2009.
Maidstone, who play in the sixth tier National League South, had captured the hearts of football romantics with their run to the last 16.
They had survived seven ties to become the first team outside the top five divisions to reach the fifth round since Blyth Spartans in 1978.
George Elokobi’s men had stunned Championship promotion chasers Ipswich with a 2-1 win at Portman Road in the fourth round.
But Coventry, who won the FA Cup in 1987, were never in danger of suffering the same fate as Ipswich.
“How can I not be proud of our community and our players. They gave it their all today. Massive congratulations to them,” Elokobi said.
“The magic of the FA Cup is still alive. When we began this FA Cup journey, we knew we weren’t going to win it. It was about showcasing our talent and skills. We have done that.
“It’s given us life mom­ents to remember together. Everyone connected to the club are proud of us.”
Simms fired Mark Rob­ins’ Championship play-off chasers into a ninth-minute lead from Kasey Palmer’s pass to silence the 5,000 Maidstone fans who made the trip from Kent.
The former Everton striker grabbed his fourth goal in four games six minutes later, combining with Palmer to drill in a low angled effort from 15 yards.
Maidstone, who lost 2-0 to Aveley on Saturday to leave them eighth in Nat­ional League South, were unable to get a foothold in the tie.
Simms completed his hat-trick 10 minutes before the break, with Palmer’s shot pushed out for the striker to finish from close-range.
Maidstone keeper Lucas Covolan, one of the heroes of their win against Ipswich, tried his best to keep the score down as he saved from Palmer and Josh Eccles.
But Coventry still found time to score twice late on through Tavares.
The midfielder rifled in from Matty Godden’s pass with two minutes left before he followed up in stoppage time to net after Covolan parried Godden’s effort.
Newly-crowned League Cup winners Liverpool host second tier Southampton while Manchester United travel to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, with Chelsea taking on Leeds United at Stamford Bridge the same day.
The other ties see Bourn­e­mouth play Leicester City, Newcastle United visit Blac­k­burn and Wolver­hampton Wanderers host Brighton and Hove Albion.

4,South Korea pick Hwang Sun-hong as interim coach,"SEOUL: The Korea Football Association (KFA) said on Tuesday it has picked Hwang Sun-hong, coach of the under-23 ...","SEOUL: The Korea Football Association (KFA) said on Tuesday it has picked Hwang Sun-hong, coach of the under-23 team, as temporary head coach of the national side to prepare for the upcoming 2026 World Cup qualifiers.
The National Team Committee, a KFA advisory body, had been looking for a replacement after sacking Juergen Klinsmann in the wake of the national side’s semi-final exit at the Asian Cup and amid criticism of his leadership.
Hwang, 55, steered the under-23 national team to gold in the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games, and was a member of the 2002 World Cup squad that reached the semi-finals on home soil under Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.
Hwang was the  “No. 1 choice” given his experience and he will resume his role with the under-23 team after leading the national side through two 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Thailand in March, said Jung Hae-sung, who heads the committee.
“Our committee, in the meantime, will hold in-depth discussions to appoint a full-time coach, reviewing what kind of football we want to pursue and which style of the coach we need,” Jung told a briefing.
The KFA dismissed Klinsmann following South Korea’s stumble at the semi-final stage at the Asian Cup which extended their 64-year wait for a third title and rekindled criticism of the German coach’s leadership.
Hwang will double as coach of the national team and also prepare the under-23 squad for the Asian Football Confede­ration (AFC) Asian Cup to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics, starting in April in Qatar.
He will also have to contain infighting in the national squad after a well-publicised quarrel between captain Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur and team mate Lee Kang-in of Paris St Germain.

5,Bowen nets hat-trick as West Ham end poor run with victory over Brentford,LONDON: A hat-trick from Jarrod Bowen helped West Ham United to snap a six-match winless run in the Premier League ...,"LONDON: A hat-trick from Jarrod Bowen helped West Ham United to snap a six-match winless run in the Premier League as they secured their first victory of 2024 with a thrilling 4-2 home win over Brentford on Monday.
David Moyes’ side moved up to eighth with 39 points, level with seventh-placed Brighton and Hove Albion and five adrift of sixth-placed Manchester United. Brentford remain 16th with 25 points, five clear of the relegation zone.
“I’d hoped it was coming. It was needed. Our form in six weeks has been poor. It’s good to score four goals and get a win at home,” Moyes told the BBC.
“(Eighth place) is not bad at this time of the season. We’re always getting a level of criticism but we’re up there challenging.
“There’s a lot of teams with a lot of money and experience. It was only three years ago we were battling to avoid relegation most seasons.”
The hosts grabbed the lead five minutes into the game as Bowen collected Emerson’s pass from the left to slam home a fierce low shot before doubling the lead with a half-volley from close range two minutes later.
Neal Maupay pulled one back for the visitors in the 13th minute following a pass from Keane Lewis-Potter, sliding through the centre of the box to lob the ball over French compatriot keeper Alphonse Areola.
Bowen capitalised on Brentford’s sloppy defending to complete his first ever senior hat-trick with a header on the edge of the six-yard box in the 63rd minute, and Emerson made it 4-1 with a superb long-range shot into the top right corner in the 69th minute.
Yoane Wissa scored eight minutes from time for Brentford, who came close to a stoppage time goal but fell short as they suffered their fifth defeat in their last six games.
“There’s been a lot of games, at Hull City too, where I scored two but couldn’t get the third one,” Bowen said.
“Inside I was really happy for myself to get that first hat-trick I’ve been waiting for many years.
“We knew tonight we could create a home atmosphere with the fans and if we started well they’d respond to it.”

6,Murray drops retirement hint after 500th hardcourt win in Dubai,"DUBAI: Andy Murray hinted that this could be his last season after he recorded his 500th hardcourt win with a 4-6,...","DUBAI: Andy Murray hinted that this could be his last season after he recorded his 500th hardcourt win with a 4-6, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory over Canada’s Denis Shapo­valov in the first round of the Dubai Tennis Cham­pionships on Monday.
Murray joined Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andre Agassi and Rafa Nadal as the only players to reach the 500th tour-level win milestone on the surface in the professional era.
“Obviously hardcourt has been a great surface for me over the years and 500 is a lot of matches so I’m very proud of that,” Murray said. “There aren’t many players that have done that, so, great to get to 500 before I’m done.”
It was just the second win this year for the 36-year-old who suffered a first round exit at the recent Australian Open, and Murray has failed to go beyond the third round of a Grand Slam since reaching the Wimbledon quarters in 2017.
Murray, former world number one and winner of three Grand Slam singles titles, lost his second round match in Qatar last week to 18-year-old Jakub Mensik, and during the defeat he appeared to shout  “this game is not for me anymore”.
He played down those comments after Monday’s win in Dubai, but admitted that the end of his career could be near.
“People read a lot into what I say on the court sometimes and it’s not always rational,” he said.
“I still love competing, I still love the game. It gets harder and harder the older you get to compete with the young guys.
“It’s not easy, I probably don’t have too long left but I’ll do the best that I can these last few months.”
Last month after another first round exit in Montpellier, Murray responded to a BBC article in which a journalist questioned whether his bravely soldering on will damage his legacy.
“Tarnishing my legacy? Do me a favour,” Murray responded on social media platform X. “Most people would quit and give up in my situation right now. But I’m not most people and my mind works differently,” he added.
“I won’t quit. I will keep fighting and working to produce the performances I know I’m capable of.”

7,"HBL PSL 2024: Usman, Usama pile on the misery for Qalandars","Since winning the title last season, the Qalandars have now lost six in a row; their playoff hopes dwindling with every defeat.","LAHORE: Lahore Qalandars, desperate to end a five-match losing run, got the start they needed, only for Usman Khan and then Usama Mir to pile further misery on the two-time defending champions.
Playing their last game of the HBL Pakistan Super League on home turf, once again in front of a packed Gaddafi Stadium, skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi sent the crowd wild on Tuesday when his in-dipper got an inside edge off his Multans Sultans counterpart Mohammad Rizwan before crashing onto the stumps.
But from then on, they were largely chasing shadows as Usman took it away with a sparkling 55-ball 96, building fine partnerships with opener Reeza Hendricks (40), Tayyab Tahir (21) and Iftikhar Ahmed (40 not out), to guide the Sultans to an imposing 214-4 after they had elected to bat.
The Qalandars needed a heroic chase but despite a brisk opening stand of 54 by Sahibzada Farhan (31) and Fakhar Zaman (23), they never got partnerships going with leg-spinner Usama (6-40) ripping through their lower and middle order to send them packing for 154 with three overs to spare.
Since winning the title last season, the Qalandars have now lost six in a row; their playoff hopes dwindling with every defeat.
The Sultans, on the other hand, have won five in six and the ease with which they won on the night has made them firm contenders for the title Qalandars seem to be relinquishing.
Hendricks made little of the early dismissal of Sultans’ batting mainstay Rizwan as the South African set the game up for his side with six fours and a six in his 27-ball knock. He pulled an glanced Shaheen for successive fours to set the tone and then took on compatriot George Linde, hitting a four and a six on consecutive deliveries to help his side finish the powerplay at 53-1.
Usman was playing the anchor but got two boundaries in four balls; pulling Sikandar Raza and then turning Carlos Brathwaite off his legs. However, the 70-run partnership was broken when Hendricks was caught behind off Raza, just after he’d pulled away the spinner for his a boundary.
Usman ensured it was a minor hiccup only as he crashed Raza to the cover fence before guiding Brat­h­waite to the third man boundary. He then slam­med a flat six off Brath­waite to take the Sultans to the midway stage of their innings at 95-2.
Tayyab didn’t take long to settle and drove Salman Fayyaz down the ground for his first boundary as Usman raised his 50 on the 31st delivery he faced.
Tayyab’s deft touch fetched him a four behind the wicket off Jahandad Khan and Usman ended the 12th over with a four.
The Sultans were on the charge and Usman deposited Linde for six over mid-wicket and Tayyab paddled him for four. Usman dispatched a Zaman Khan full toss for four at deep fine leg and then slashed Brathwaite for four through the covers before Tayyab holed out in the deep.
The Sultans, though, still seemed to be headed towards a total in excess of 200 as they were 151-3 with five overs to go and Iftikhar kept them on track with an 18-ball blitz, which began when he smacked Jahan­dad for four over extra cover.
Usman thrashed Zaman for consecutive boundaries but got lucky on 89 when Brathwaite floored him at backward point. Shaheen hit Iftikhar on the grill, only for the right-hander to smash back-to-back sixes after recovering; first over deep extra cover and then over deep fine before finishing the 18th over with a cut for four.
Jahandad was belted away for a six as the Sultans crossed the 200-run mark and Usman moving moved four short of a century with his 11th boundary before Shaheen had him caught on the leg side in the last over.
Farhan and Fakhar gave Qalandars the start the big chase needed; the former cutting Khushdil Shah away for four with the first ball of the reply and then driving Mohammad Ali for four through the covers. Khushdil was then powered over mid-off for another boundary.
Fakhar got his first boundary at the start of the third over, cutting Ali past backward point, and got his second off Shahnawaz Dahani with a square drive with Farhan ensuring the fifth over ended with a flourish with three fours in a row to bring up the 50 for his side.
Fakhar started the sixth with another four but was cleaned up two balls later when Aftab Ibrahim found the yorker. Farhan followed six balls later, miscuing a sweep off Khushdil to be caught by Aftab at short fine leg.
Rassie van der Dussen (30) got off to a slow start but then opened his arms to launch chinaman Faisal Akram (2-25) for six over long-on, before being dropped at deep square two balls later. Faisal, however, got Kamran Ghulam (12) caught at deep mid-wicket to leave Qalandars at 91-3 after 10 overs.
Raza (17) smacked consecutive sixes off Usama in the following over but Faisal sent him back as the Zimbabwean tried to go for another big hit but found Hendricks at deep mid-wicket.
Shaheen promoted himself up the order and muscled Usama for six wide of long-on, only for the leggie to get him stumped three balls later. Usama retu­rned an over later to get Van der Dussen caught in the deep and then got two in two balls, first having Linde caught behind and then uprooted Jahandad’s off-stump to leave the Qalandars reeling at 133-8 with four overs to go.
Brathwaite landed some big hits before Usama returned to get Salman caught at mid-off after the tailender had launched him for a six over long-on and then finished off the Qalandars by having Zaman caught in the deep for his career-best T20 figures.

8,Kings captain Shan unfazed by lack of big individual performances,The former HBL champions have kicked off this year’s campaign with two wins out of the three they have played so far.,"KARACHI: Karachi Kings captain Shan Mas­ood is unfazed by the apparent lack of big individual contributions from his team-mates. The batter, instead, is proud of how they have showed up when needed the most.
The former HBL Pakis­tan Super League (PSL) champions have kicked off this year’s campaign with two wins out of the three they have played so far and will make their first appea­rance at home this season when they face Islamabad United at the National Bank Stadium on Wednesday.
With the momentum on their back, the Kings will con­tinue what has been du­b­bed as their rebuilding sta­ge after a disastrous run last season, and Shan is excited to do it in front of home fans.  
“We are very excited about playing in Karachi, it’s a new direction, a new team, and we are ready to play in front of the home fans,” he told reporters here on Tuesday. “It’s a special occasion for Karachi Kings, we’ve made a good start. 
“But a good team is the one which learns from its mistakes and builds on its positives and the aim is to perform well in tomorrow’s match as well.”
Following their loss to Multan Sultans in their opening match, Karachi bounced back with wins against Peshawar Zalmi and Lahore Qalandars. 
In both wins, Shan saw small performances from a number of his players reaping the results for the Kings.
While Mir Hamza and Hasan Ali shared six wickets between them and James Vince and Kieron Pollard took Karachi across the line in the Zalmi fixture, Pollard and Shoaib Malik secured the victory against the Qalandars.
Those are the performan­ces one could point out from a scorecard, but Shan appr­eciates even the minute acts of service by his players towards the team’s cause.  
“The special thing for us so far is that there has been no one outstanding individual performance,” he said. “A number of players have given small performances, be it batting or bowling and most importantly fielding. 
“A good quality for any team is that anyone can perform in any match. The tournament can be of 10 to 14 matches, and we will be happy if a player performs in two matches and the other performs well in the other two.”
Shan went on to mention how Karachi’s chinaman bowler Tabraiz Shamsi went for 42 runs against Qalandars but took the crucial wicket of Shai Hope, who was threatening to take the game away from the Kings at that point.
He also lauded the South African spinner for conceding just two runs in his last over against Zalmi to bring the team back into the game and limited the Peshawar outfit to a lower total than the latter may have targeted.
Shan backed Moham­mad Nawaz despite the all-rounder’s struggles in his first season with Karachi and believed that his Pakistan team-mate had showed up when there had been an opportunity for him to make a difference.
Shan, who hasn’t been able to get going himself so far, said he hoped to put up a good show soon.
“I got starts in all three innings but sadly got out after that,” Shan said. “But once again somebody has to perform, and when I do, I hope it’s when the team needs it the most.”

In the opening game of a tri-series also featuring the Netherlands, Loftie-Eaton smashed 11 fours and eight sixes before being dismissed for 101 from 36 deliveries.
The previous record was held by Nepal’s Kushal Malla, who reached a T20I hundred from 34 balls against Mongolia last year.
Namibia posted 206-4 batting first, before Loftie-Eaton also took two wickets as hosts Nepal fell short in their chase, losing by 20 runs.
The three teams competing in the tri-series have all qualified for the T20 World Cup to be held in June in the Caribbean and United States.

11,Wagner retires from international cricket,"“It’s never an easy time to do something like this, but the time has obviously come,” said the 37-year-old Wagner, who has taken 260 Test wickets.","WELLINGTON: An emotional Neil Wag­ner announced his retirement from international cricket Tuesday, after the fast bowler was left out of New Zealand’s team for the first Test against Australia this week.
Wagner fought back tears as he told reporters he had decided to call time on a 64-Test career after New Zealand Cricket said he would not be in the side for Thursday’s match in Wellington.
“It’s never an easy time to do something like this, but the time has obviously come,” said the 37-year-old Wagner, who has taken 260 Test wickets. “It’s been amazing to represent the Black Caps. It’s been some of the proudest moments of my life. Fiery short-ball specialist Wagner said he would leave the squad before the start of next week’s second Test in Christchurch.
“I’m looking forward to one final week in camp and will be doing everything I can to help prepare and support the boys,” he said.
Wagner cited last year’s one-run victory over England in Wellington, where he took the last wicket to draw the series, as among his career highlights along with winning the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021.
“I’ve enjoyed every single moment of playing test cricket for the Black Caps and am proud of everything we’ve been able to achieve as a team,” he said.
Wagner made his New Zealand debut in 2012 after arriving from his native South Africa four years earlier.
“To the New Zealand public and the fans, I can’t thank you enough, for your support, for making me feel welcome, for making me feel like a Kiwi,” said Wagner.
Only Richard Hadlee, current captain Tim Southee, Daniel Vettori and Trent Boult have taken more Test wickets for New Zealand than Wagner.
New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said on Tuesday that Wagner was “one of the greats”.
“He has been through an incredible era and been a huge cog of the bowling attack over the years. We’ll remember his lion-heartedness, the way he just kept finding a way to make something happen.”

12,"Paralympics chief hopes for full stadiums, extensive TV coverage in Paris","Contrary to the Olympics, ticket sales for Paralympics typically soar closer to the start of the Games.","PARIS: International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons has told AFP he hopes the Paralympics in Paris will take place in full stadiums and predicted the TV coverage would be the most extensive in history.
The 16th Summer Paralympics take place in the French capital from Aug 28 to Sept 8, just over two weeks after the Olympics.
In an interview six months before they open, Parsons said his priority was to ensure the competition attracts packed audiences.
Less than one million tickets out of a total of 2.8 million have been sold so far, but the IPC president insisted that was a  “normal” situation this long before a Paralympics.
“We are working with the organising committee to make sure that we have full stadiums in Paris,” said Parsons, a Brazilian who has been in charge of the IPC since 2017.
“We have some sports that are nearly sold out. We are satisfied where we are, but of course we need to push for more.
“We are very pleased with the preparation so far. We’re in this moment where all the operational plans are ready.
“We have learned from the test events, and we are now in the moment where what we need to focus on is the fine-tuning of some of the operations. We are all focused on the promotion of the Games,” he added.
To achieve the goal of full stadiums in Paris, the IPC are deploying a myriad of campaigns through different channels such as social media, traditional media and national Paralympic committees to spread the word and  “(make) people raise the excitement around the Games… (and be) aware, informed, wanting to buy tickets and to watch it on TV”.
Contrary to the Olympics, ticket sales for Paralympics typically soar closer to the start of the Games.
At the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, organisers reported a strong spike in purchaser appetite in the weeks leading up to the event, with the overall number of tickets sold doubling over a 48-hour period two weeks before the Games opened.
If ticket sales are currently following  “a normal graphic line for the Paralympics”, Parsons said media coverage for the Games had already surpassed that of previous editions.
Broadcasting agreements have been secured in more than 160 nations and territories, constituting the  “biggest number ever”, he said.
GEOPOLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS
In the wake of the decision to partially ban the Russian and Belarusian national committees from the Paralympics over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Parsons said the IPC were still ironing out the final details that will allow some athletes to compete as neutrals.
“The decision also tasked the governing board to develop the eligibility criteria and the conditions that will be placed on neutral athletes,” he said.
“So, we are still working on that. We still have time.” He said the IPC  “cannot only copy and paste what the IOC did” in banning most Russian and Belarusian competitors from the Paris Olympics over the situation in Ukraine.
“But, of course, we can learn from them and see what is feasible in our movement and what is not.”
Conversely, Israeli and Palestinian competitors are both set to participate in Paris despite the ongoing war in Gaza, according to Parsons.
“The national Paralympic committees of Palestine and of Israel have not used the Paralympic movement (for) any kind of political messages. So far there is nothing to report on both NPCs. No investigation, no suspension, anything like that,” he said.
The IPC president also addressed potential fears regarding security in Paris, saying he was confident in the authorities’ ability to  “provide a safe environment, not only for our athletes but for spectators, volunteers, everyone working in the Games”.
