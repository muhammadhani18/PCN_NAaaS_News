0,China agrees to rollover $2b debt on existing terms,Beijing had initially sought a hike in interest rate,"China has agreed to rollover a $2 billion debt on existing terms after initially seeking a hike in price, as Pakistan’s policy to maintain foreign exchange reserves through deposits by three countries is becoming costly due to a 118% surge in interest cost.

The Ministry of Finance officials said that an understanding has been reached with Beijing to further extend the repayment period of the $2 billion loan maturing on March 23 –the Pakistan Day.
The Chinese embassy’s response was awaited.

Sources said that China had initially asked to further increase the interest rates on the $2 billion debt. Pakistan is currently paying 7.1% interest rate on the basis of the six-month Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus 1.715%.

The officials said that China has informally communicated its decision to further extend the repayment period and the finance ministry was waiting for a formal response.

Interim Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar last month formally requested the Chinese government to rollover the maturing loans, according to the officials.

Pakistan paid Rs26.6 billion in interest in the last fiscal year to China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the $9 billion deposits that these three nations placed with the State Bank of Pakistan, the SBP balance sheet showed.

In the preceding year, the country had paid Rs12.2 billion that within a year jumped by 118%.
The authorities said that a major factor behind the 118% increase in the interest cost was the currency devaluation in the previous fiscal year.

The central bank’s gross official foreign exchange reserves stand at $8 billion. Over the past one decade, Pakistan has adopted a policy to borrow from the regional countries during difficult economic times.

It has not been able to strengthen the repayment capacity and as a result these loans are extended at the time of their maturity.

As of June last year, the regional countries had placed $9 billion in deposits.

Subsequent to a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had further increased their exposure to Pakistan, taking the total tally to $12 billion for the three nations.

The cost of interest on these deposits is now expected to increase substantially for this fiscal year after the increase in the size of the deposits.

The SBP’s balance sheet showed that during the last fiscal year Pakistan paid another amount of Rs42.1 billion to China on account of interest for using a $4.5 billion Chinese trade finance facility for debt purposes.

The SBP report showed that the central bank fully tapped the $4.5 billion, or 30 billion Yuan, trade finance facility available under the China-Pakistan currency swap arrangement.

It added that Rs42.1 billion interest was charged on the outstanding balance at agreed rates, which was Rs5.8 billion or 16% higher than the preceding year.

In rupee terms, the bilateral currency swap value increased from Rs927 billion in the preceding year to Rs1.2 trillion by end of last fiscal year. Pakistan largely utilised the Chinese trade finance facility to repay foreign debt and keep its gross foreign currency reserves at their levels.

The $4.5 billion facility is part of the SBP’s $8 billion in gross official foreign exchange reserves. China has also extended $4 billion worth of SAFE deposits, which are also part of the $8 billion reserves.

Pakistan’s gross reserves are now not enough to service these two Chinese facilities.

The successive governments have failed to tap non-debt creating inflows, which has exposed the country to various risks. The exports are growing at a pace that is not enough to finance the imports. The foreign direct investment remains dry and stagnant.

The political instability and the ad-hoc measures such as disrupting the social media services and the internet are sending negative signals to the foreign investors.

The existing $8 billion worth of official foreign currency reserves are the result of foreign lending despite having the umbrella of the IMF.

The SBP balance sheet also revealed that Pakistan obtained the IMF loans at interest rates ranging from 1.89% to 4.98%. The country paid Rs29.5 billion in interest rate to the IMF during the last fiscal year, according to the report.

Pakistan’s existing IMF programme is expiring in six weeks. The last tranche of $1.2 billion remains undisbursed and it will be the first task of the new finance minister to receive the IMF mission and secure a staff-level agreement in March.

There is still no clarity who will be the next finance minister – a portfolio that the PML-N should have announced days ago aimed at giving clarity to the international financial institutions and local markets.

1,Zardari’s win is a forgone conclusion,ECP issues schedule for presidential election,"Former president Asif Ali Zardari is all set to be re-elected as the 14th president of the country as the result of the elections for the new head of the state is a forgone conclusion.

The required support and numbers are there and it is going to be just a formality to elect Zardari, known as the ‘king of reconciliation’ and the one who knows that art of making impossible possible, as the president for the second time in a few days.

With the announcement that the newly stitched alliance of the PML-N, the PPP, and others was ready to form a coalition government at the Centre under the stewardship of PML-N’s Shehbaz Sharif, it was announced that Asif Ali Zardari would be the joint candidate for the country’s top constitutional office.

The shrewd politician, who is the widower of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the president of the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP), had occupied the presidency before – from Sept 9, 2008 to Sept 8, 2013. It may be recalled that Benazir was assassinated in Dec 2007.

After that, Zardari along with his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who is the chairman of the PPP and served as the foreign minister during last government, have taken the reigns of the party. Throughout his political career, the former president has faced a raft of cases and remained in jail on various charges over the years.

Nicknamed as ‘Mr 10 Percent’, Zardari had spent 11 years in jail on corruption charges, among other things, before becoming the president in 2008. Though the allegations of corruption have always followed him, he along with his party members has always maintained his innocence as nothing has been proven against him and he has never been convicted by courts.

Despite his tumultuous political career, Zardari had made history by surrendering the powers of the president during his last stint.

It was he who, being the president, had reduced the president to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping the president’s office of the power to dissolve parliament, to dismiss elected prime ministers, and to appoint military chiefs, among other things, when the government had passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010.

Also, he had surrendered the power to appoint the chief election commissioner by substituting it with a mechanism that involved the opposition in the process.

All of these moves were not only unprecedented but showed Zardari’s vision and maturity as a politician.

With his permanent gleeful smile, his decision to involve political opponents in making the constitutional appointments showed the kind of tolerance level he wishes to see in the country, which is otherwise engulfed by polarisation.

How president is elected?

On Tuesday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) unveiled the timetable for the upcoming presidential election.

Under Article 41(4) of the Constitution, the presidential election must be conducted within 30 days of the general elections.

Since the general elections were held on Feb 8, the presidential elections are due on March 9.
The ECP said that it will release the official schedule and public notice for the election of the president on March 1.

In accordance with constitutional provisions, a specific day will be designated for the submission of nomination papers, and candidates have the option to submit these papers to any presiding officer.

The ECP stated that the formation of the Electoral College, a crucial component for the presidential election, is set to be completed on Feb 29, when the members of the national and others assemblies would take oath and become eligible to vote for the president’s election.

The president is elected indirectly by parliament for a five-year term and acts as a ceremonial figurehead. Though the president has no direct authority in running the government, he can directly grant pardons and reprieves; appoint higher commands in military with support from the prime minister and confirm judicial appointments, among other things.

Under Article 41(3) of the Constitution, the president is elected in a special session of parliament, Senate and all four provincial assemblies. The Electoral College of 692 votes of lawmakers includes 96 senators and 336 members of the National Assembly and 260 votes of the four provincial assemblies.

Currently, the total number of lawmakers is 1,181, which includes 96 senators, 336 MNAs and 749 legislators of the provincial assemblies.

In order to ensure equal representation, all provincial assemblies are given 65 votes each in the Electoral College as it is the smallest number of the members in Balochistan Assembly.

The MNAs and senators’ vote is counted as one vote for each member. With 371 parliamentarians, Punjab’s 5.7 members equal one vote; Sindh’s 2.58 members make one vote; and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s 2.2 members vote is counted as one.

Being the joint candidate of the upcoming ruling parties and having majority seats in Sindh and Balochistan assemblies, Zardari – who has earned the reputation of the one who can turn the tables anytime – is set to enter the Presidency with an overwhelmingly majority.

He would replace incumbent President Dr Arif Alvi, who is the third one to complete five-year tenure. In fact, he is only one who has spent over five months after the expiration of his term as the Constitution states that the President shall continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office.

2,SIC’s reserved seats plea left hanging by ECP,"Poll watchdog reserves verdict, letting the controversy simmer","As the curtains rise on the first session of the National Assembly today, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) found itself unable to dispel the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the allocation of reserved seats for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), following a PTI-SIC 'merger' for this specific purpose.
The electoral body yet again appeared to drag its feet and let the controversy simmer after it reserved the verdict on the petitions filed by the SIC seeking the allocation of women and minority seats – leaving the matter up in the air as the maiden sitting of NA takes convenes today.
Moreover, the PTI has decided to escalate the matter to the Supreme Court if the reserved seats were given to other parties.
The SIC contends that since the ball was in the ECP's court, a decision could have nipped a brewing controversy over the NA’s fresh tenure in the bud by deciding whether the party deserved its share of the reserved seats.
Moreover, the controversy deepened when the ECP disclosed that SIC Chairman Hamid Raza had written a letter refusing to accept the reserved seats – a claim vehemently denied by Raza.
A five-member bench, chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, conducted the hearing on Wednesday.
The ECP considered applications pertaining to the reserved seats of the Sunni Ittehad Council, with the presence of PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and SIC chief Hamid Raza before the commission.
During the hearing, CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja presented a letter from the SIC to the PTI counsel, stating that the party did not participate in the general elections and therefore did not desire the reserved seats.
However, Zafar expressed ignorance about the letter, stating that the SIC had not informed PTI about any such decision. In response, CEC Raja questioned the insistence on the allotment of reserved seats if the SIC had expressed a lack of interest.
PTI lawyer Ali Zafar objected that the ECP had decided yesterday to issue notices to all parliamentary parties.
The electoral body addressed the plea following President Alvi's refusal to sign a Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs summary requesting the convening of a National Assembly session.
President Alvi insisted that the allocation of the remaining reserved seats should precede the summoning of the NA session, as mandated within 21 days of the elections under the Constitution.
In the previous hearing, CEC Raja consolidated petitions from SIC, MQM-P, PPP, and PML-N. Advocates Farogh Naseem, Ali Zafar, Farooq H Naek, and Azam Nazeer Tarar represented MQM-P, SIC, PPP, and PML-N, respectively, before the five-member bench.
During the proceedings on Wednesday, Barrister Zafar argued that 86 independents, who won National Assembly seats, joined the SIC. ""SIC is a political party with the right to form a government and contest elections,"" he asserted.
In response, a commission member pointed out that SIC did not participate in the February 8 polls.
Barrister Zafar emphasised that independents play a crucial role in presidential elections, citing constitutional provisions for reserved seat allocation.
CEC Raja assured that reserved seats would be allocated in accordance with the Constitution. Barrister Zafar contended that a party can include independent candidates and become a parliamentary party.
CEC Raja mentioned having a letter from SIC stating that the party neither contested nor sought reserved seats. Barrister Zafar claimed the PTI was unaware of the letter.
PPP's Naek argued that SIC failed to submit a priority list within the deadline. PML-N's Tarar asserted that reserved seats cannot be granted to independents under the law.
MQM-P's Naseem urged the ECP to allocate reserved seats to his party, emphasising SIC's non-parliamentary status. ""The head of the SIC also contested the elections as an independent,"" he noted.
After the completion of the arguments, the ECP reserved the verdict.

SIC refutes refusal of reserved seats
On the other hand, SIC Chairman Hamid Raza denied that the party refused to take reserved seats in a letter addressed to the ECP.
Addressing the media in Islamabad, Raza asserted that the letter sent to the ECP WAS being misconstrued.
In a media interaction after the hearing, Raza clarified that the ECP routinely sends letters to all parties after general elections, specifying a five per cent quota for women in the distribution of tickets. He emphasised that the letter in question was not exclusive to the SIC but addressed to all participating parties.
Raza stated that since his party did not participate in the elections, the SIC informed the ECP about its non-participation, and therefore, they had no list to allocate 5 per cent of tickets to women.
He clarified that the SIC did not express a refusal for reserved seats, and their letter did not mention any such rejection.
""We have a letter, and there is no mention of reserved seats in this letter,"" Raza maintained. ""It should be read on the basis of Article 206 of the Constitution. My affidavit is also available, which says if we contest elections, we will take reserved seats.""
Raza asserted that his letter had been distorted and misinterpreted and left the decision on the matter to the ECP's discretion. ""It is the will of the CEC to interpret it whichever way he deems fit,"" he added.
PTI denounces 'stealing’ of reserved seats
Meanwhile, the PTI decried the “shameful” plan to “steal” seats reserved for women and minorities in the National Assembly.
In a statement on X, PTI accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of distributing reserved seats among “mandate thieves” through “unconstitutional” plans.
Article 51 of the Constitution clearly lays out the basic principle of allocation of reserved seats, which are given to women and minorities in proportion to general seats, the party said.
“The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) is the parliamentary party with the largest number of seats in the Centre, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“The allocation of reserved seats to the [SIC] is part of an unconstitutional and undemocratic plan to illegally and forcibly convert the majority into a minority.”
PTI also vowed to take back the National and Punjab Assembly seats allocated through “fake Form 47s” and strongly resist the “unconstitutional” allocation of reserved seats.""
Moreover, the PTI announced to escalate the matter to the SC if SIC reserved seats were distributed among other parties.
In a media talk, Barrister Ali Zafar said he hoped a decision would be taken as per the law and Constitution.
“But if our seats are distributed among the PML-N and PPP […] then we will definitely approach the Supreme Court but it would be such a huge violation that it will make the election of prime minister, president, Senate, NA speaker and deputy speaker will become controversial and will hold no legitimacy,” he added.""

3,Senate echoes with Lahore mob trying to attack woman,Lawmakers slam growing ‘ignorance’ and ‘intolerance’ in country’s society,"The senators on Tuesday condemned the “ignorance” of a mob that attacked a young woman wearing a dress with Arabic calligraphy printed on it, demanding strict action against those who falsely accused her of committing blasphemy.

The incident occurred on Sunday in Lahore’s Ichra Bazaar when police saved a woman sporting a kurta, which superimposed imprints of the Arabic words “beautiful life” by a popular clothing brand that led some to believe they denoted a Quranic verse.

A video circulating on social media captured the terrified woman hiding in a shop, refuting the allegations of blasphemy.

Later, a police team led by Gulberg Circle Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi intervened and saved the woman from the mob.

Among the videos in circulation on social media, the ASP can be seen addressing the angry men with a direct stare, her voice loud and firm, reminding everyone to trust her and her team which has satisfactorily handled similar incidents in the past.

As per the ASP, no blasphemous act had occurred. She, alongside other senior police officials, examined the dress and confirmed that the Arabic calligraphy was indeed unrelated to scripture.

In her statement, the woman rejected the allegations of blasphemy, emphasising her commitment to respecting Islam as she hailed from a religious family.

Speaking in the upper house of parliament, Senator Rubina Khalid of the PPP expressed her concern over the growing intolerance in the country.

Describing the incident in Lahore as an unfortunate one, she said ignorance was spreading in the country’s society.

“There is a major difference between an ignorant and a Muslim,” Rubina added.

The PPP senator pointed that the woman was forced to apologise for wearing an outfit with Arabic calligraphy, which the ignorant mob was unaware of.

“Why was she forced to issue a public apology for something she didn’t do?”

She continued that the kurta worn by the woman superimposed imprints of an Arabic word, but it was compared to a Quranic verse.

Rubina observed that the kurta the young woman was wearing belonged to a brand based in Saudi Arabia. “It’s fine there but here women are harassed in the name of religion.”

Speaking on the matter, MQM-P Senator Faisal Subzwari inquired what kind of a Muslim was someone, who could not identify between a Quranic verse and a simple Arabic word.

He also lamented the growing intolerance in the society, saying that it had become common to hurl accusations of blasphemy against each other.

The MQM-P senator emphasised that using religion to level false allegations was the worst form of disrespect.

“This is a major problem, I wish the house could have completed the legislation over the misuse of blasphemy laws,” he added.

Subzwari asked who was defaming the religion. “Was it that woman or is it the people who despite reading the word falsely accused her?""

The MQM-P senator demanded strict action against the people who level false allegations of blasphemy.

“Islam is a religion of peace and harmony. Our country and religion are defamed by tragic incidents like the one in Lahore.”

Meanwhile, lawmakers belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday protested in the Senate, demanding the immediate release of the party founder, Imran Khan, his wife, and the female activists of the party.

During a session presided over by Deputy Chairman Mirza Afridi, Senator Kamran Murtaza of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Saadia Abbasi of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supported the PTI’s contention for the issuance of a production order for the senators in custody.

At the outset of the session, the PTI senators raised slogans in the house for the release of the party founder and other imprisoned PTI women.

Senator Ali Zafar said that the PTI women supporters were in jails for many months.

He said that the PTI won 90% of the seats in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, but the party was not being allocated the reserved seats it deserved. He warned that stealing the PTI’s seats was against the law and the Constitution.

PTI Senator Faisal Javed said that on Feb 8, the nation reposed full confidence in the PTI founder.
He added that a lack of trust would not end if those with 17 seats came to power.

Later, the PTI senators staged a walkout from the proceedings in protest.

PML-N Senator Saadia supported PTI’s demand for the issuance of the production orders of senators Ijaz Chaudhry and Shibli Faraz.

She also demanded the resignation of the chief election commissioner for failing to conduct transparent elections.

JUI-F’s Kamran Murtaza deplored the treatment meted out to the PTI women supporters.

He said what happened to PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz during the PTI government was wrong, and whatever was happening to the PTI’s women supporters was also wrong.

4,Alvi strikes defiant note on NA session,Caretaker PM advises president to convene sitting,"With the clock ticking down on the constitutionally mandated deadline for summoning the National Assembly session, President Arif Alvi continued to stonewall the process on Tuesday, with the ball now in the NA secretariat’s court to make the call.

Alvi, whose presidency is nearing its conclusion, has been withholding approval for the NA session, demanding a resolution to the issue of reserved seats for women and minorities distributed among parties, in accordance with the law.

His delay tactics have drawn criticism from political parties, including the PML-N and PPP, urging him not to misuse his powers as the head of state.

Observers speculate that the president aims to postpone the session until the Election Commission of Pakistan issues a notification regarding the reserved seats of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), a group that most PTI-backed lawmakers have recently joined.

The ECP, however, clarified that the issue of SIC reserved seats is currently ""under consideration by the commission"" and is scheduled for a hearing tomorrow following today's adjournment.

On Tuesday, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar once again advised the president to convene the session, while granting authority to the NA secretariat to call the session after the constitutional deadline.

In the summary, Kakar emphasised that calling a sitting within 21 days of the elections was a constitutional obligation.

Meanwhile, in anticipation of the president's potential inaction, alternative arrangements for convening the NA meeting have been finalised.

The caretaker premier has empowered the NA Secretariat to schedule a meeting after the expiration of the constitutional deadline, with sources suggesting that the notification for the NA session is likely to be issued between Wednesday and Thursday night.

‘Alvi violating constitution’

Meanwhile, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) stalwart and Senator Ishaq Dar levelled serious allegations against President Alvi, accusing him of attempting to once again violate the constitution.

Speaking to the media in Islamabad, Dar, expressing concerns over the obstruction of the upcoming National Assembly meeting scheduled for February 29, urged fellow members not to sign any documents supporting the alleged unconstitutional actions.

He highlighted instances where members were unable to take their oaths during previous sessions, stressing the importance of upholding constitutional procedures.

Dar stressed that the failure by the president to sign the necessary documents for the assembly meeting indicated a deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings, suggesting a disregard for constitutional principles.

He condemned such actions, stating that they were tarnishing the nation's reputation on the international stage.

The senior PML-N leader underscored the clarity of the constitution regarding the convening of assembly sessions, criticising Alvi’s objections and the subsequent return of the summary.

Dar affirmed that members whose notifications had been issued would fulfil their obligations, despite the challenges faced.

Expressing frustration at what he termed as ""games being played with the constitution,"" Dar called for a proper resolution of the issue by the President. He assured that the National Assembly meeting would proceed as scheduled on February 29, dismissing any confusion surrounding the session.

Dar reiterated his commitment to fostering unity among members of both national and provincial assemblies, stressing the importance of inclusivity in the political process.

He also refuted President Alvi's assertion that the constitution was incomplete, citing reports of a federal government response to the objections raised.

It is pertinent to note that development took place a day after National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf had to convene the inaugural session of the lower house of parliament at 10 am on Feb 29.

As per the Constitution, the initial session of the National Assembly is mandated to be convened within 21 days after the general elections held on Feb 8. Section 91(2) of the Constitution stipulates: “The National Assembly shall meet on the twenty-first day following the day on which a general election to the assembly is held, unless sooner summoned by the president.”

5,PTI asks IMF to mull ‘political stability’ in loan talks,Party says global lender promised transparent polls in Pakistan,"The PTI has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to factor in the country's political stability in any further bailout talks, it emerged on Wednesday.
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, PTI stalwart Barrister Gohar Ali Khan confirmed that the party had sent a letter to the IMF, adding that it would reveal its content after it reached Washington.
Giving hints of what the letter might read, Gohar said the PTI had reminded the IMF of its promise that transparent elections would be held in Pakistan.
However, The Express Tribune has obtained a copy of the letter. Addressed to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, the PTI in the letter claimed that it did not want to stand in the way of any global lender’s facility for Pakistan.
However, the party stressed the need for the necessary reforms along with the facility to facilitate the repayment of the loans.
“The IMF can negotiate only with an elected government that has the confidence of the people,” it stated.
The party urged the Washington-based lender to take into account its policy guidance note prepared in 1997.
“It is a well-established reality that a government without legitimate representation, when imposed upon a country, carries no moral authority to govern, and, in particular, to carry out taxation measures.”
The letter pointed out that in the last interaction held between PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan and IMF representatives in 2023, the party had agreed to support the global lender’s financing facility involving Pakistan on the condition and reassurance of a free and fair election in the country.
Also read: PTI says not an obstacle to IMF programme
“In the foregoing backdrop, it is noteworthy that the general elections conducted in Pakistan on February 8, 2024, on which public expenditure of about PKR 50 billion (or US$ 180 million) was incurred, were subjected to widespread intervention and fraud in the counting of votes and compilation of results. This intervention and fraud have been so brazen that the IMF’s most important member countries including the US, Great Britain, and countries forming part of the European Union have called for a full and transparent investigation into the matter. A mission of the European Union has carried out an examination of the general elections of February 8, 2024. The report of the said mission must be examined by the IMF and made available to the people of Pakistan.”
The letter continued that it was not just the PTI, but several other political parties in Pakistan, along with a number of western governments, Commonwealth observers, local civil society organisations, as well as international print and electronic media, have called for an independent probe into the claims of intervention and electoral fraud in the country on and after February 8 this year.
“We do not call for the IMF to adopt the role of an investigative agency. There are at least two indigenous organizations in Pakistan namely the Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) and PATTAN-Coalition38 that have proposed comprehensive methodologies to conduct an audit of the General Elections 2024 which, with some modifications, could be implemented locally to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. Such a role by the IMF would be a great service to Pakistan and its people, and could become the harbinger of enduring prosperity, growth, and macroeconomic stability in the country.”
Speaking at the news conference, PTI’s Omar Ayub maintained that his party had neither stood in the way of an IMF programme in the past, nor would it do so in future.
Also read: Imran wants IMF loan contingent upon vote audit
He added that the IMF had reached an understanding with the PTI that fair and free general election would be held in the country.
However, he lamented the alleged massive rigging that took place in the recent polls
Ayub maintained that the “Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) 2.0” could not introduce any reforms.
He added that these people could not use money properly.
Ayub demanded that FAFEN should audit the general polls and bring out the facts.
He claimed that the PTI wanted the loans to be used for reforms and not wasted on lavish spending.
Talking to the media, PTI’s Muzzammil Aslam said his party had been falsely accused of sabotaging the IMF programme.
He pointed out that Pakistan had received 14 programmes from the IMF and managed to complete only one of them.
Aslam noted that 12 of the 14 programmes were taken by the PPP and PML-N.
“The largest of them was taken by the PPP in 2008.”
In an email to Reuters, the IMF confirmed it had yet to receive the PTI’s letter.
Last week, the IMF declined to comment on the country's political situation after the PTI founding chairman’s aides said they would urge the lender to call for an independent audit of the country’s disputed February 8 elections before engaging in further talks with Islamabad.
Sohail Ahmed of Karachi-based Topline securities said the letter was unlikely to have a major market impact. ""The IMF will do its own due diligence,"" he added.

6,Nawaz chooses Ayaz for NA speaker,Endorses Shehbaz as PM candidate,"PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday named party president and his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif as the candidate for the country’s next prime minister and nominated Ayaz Sadiq for the slot of National Assembly speaker.
Anticipating the challenges facing the nation, the PML-N Quaid forewarned that the next one-and-a-half to two years would be difficult for the country, advising his party’s parliamentarians to maintain unity in the face of impending adversity.
The development took place during the PML-N’s joint parliamentary meeting in the provincial capital.
Addressing the huddle, Nawaz praised his younger brother, stating that Shehbaz must be commended for his “dedicated and courageous service” during the last sixteen months of his tenure as premier, which helped prevent the country from defaulting.
The PML-N supremo remarked that if he were in Shehbaz's position, he would not have been able to work effectively under those conditions.
He stated that Shehbaz was the “best choice” in¬¬ the given circumstances, underscoring that during their tenure they would focus on “healing Pakistan” and lead it out of crises.
He observed that fixing the country today appeared to be a daunting task, adding that the next one-and-half to two years would be challenging, as tough decisions were needed to be made.
“If we perform our duties with good intention, Almighty will extend his help,” Nawaz said.
“Primary goal is to provide relief to people in gas and electricity prices, tackle inflation and stabilize rupee dollar parity. We will have to proceed with a preplanned roadmap in order to succeed.”

Taking a jibe at PTI, Nawaz stated that his party leaders should not pay heed to allegations of rigging, emphasizing t¬hat they stood against those who disregard logic.
He noted that only those elections were deemed fair by the former ruling party where they emerged victorious, whereas they cried foul and claimed rigging if they lost.
The PML-N supremo recalled that in 2013, the PTI made similar “false claims” that later turned out to be “nothing but a pack of lies”.
However, he conceded that given the overall scenario, the mood of the current parliamentary meeting was not as upbeat as it used to be in past.

Without naming Imran, Nawaz recalled that when the PTI founder fell off stage at a rally in 2013, he visited him in the hospital and suspended his election campaign for the day.
Nawaz recounted that following the election victory, he paid another visit to Imran at his Bani Gala residence where they agreed to work together towards enhancing living standards in the country.
He said despite the PTI’s plans to organize sit-ins and rallies in London against them, the PML-N remained committed to fulfilling its election promises.
Taking a swipe at the retired judges who had issued his disqualification decision, the PML-N supremo questioned their whereabouts, asking whether they could even face the public.
He reiterated that he was ousted for not accepting salary from his son.
“Where is Justice Saqib Nisar?” he asked.
He criticized the terms used in the judgment against him, asserting that they reflected a personal vendetta. He expressed that if the momentum achieved by 2017 had persisted, they would have been among the G20 nations. Additionally, he reminded his party parliamentarians of the projects initiated during his tenure.
Earlier in the meeting, Shehbaz extended a warm welcome to independent MNAs Barrister Aqeel Malik, Waseem Qadir, Rashid Akbar Khan Nawani and Raza Hayat Hiraj to the party.
He also expressed admiration for his brother, stating that counting the project planks laid during Nawaz’s tenures would be an extensive endeavour, taking months to complete.
“Nawaz laid a network of infrastructure projects, nearly ended loadshedding and eradicated terrorism during his term. Despite being ousted unfairly Nawaz did not resort to arson or vandalism.”
In a reference to the PTI which is accused of being involved in the May 9 incident, Shehbaz remarked that while Zulfiqar Bhutto was hanged and Benazir was assassinated, no one directed their attention towards GHQ.
He also censured President Arif Alvi for “trampling Constitution under his feet” by not calling the assembly session within the constitutionally defined timeline.
Shehbaz said they would take decisions in consultation with other parties while ensuring the participation of state institutions.
He also presented a resolution wherein the party reposed its trust in Nawaz and vowed to work with dedication under his leadership to meet the expectations of the people.

7,All set for 16th NA to meet today,President signs fresh advice for sitting,"The stage is set for the commencement of the 16th National Assembly’s five-year term on Thursday with lawmakers preparing to gather in the lower house of parliament to take the oath and assume their positions on the treasury and opposition benches to formally initiate legislative proceedings.
In a late night development on Wednesday, the president signed a fresh advice for convening the assembly session on Thursday.
According to the sources, at the very last moment, President Dr Alvi signed the second advice sent by the caretaker premier and approved the convening of the first session of the newly elected lower house of parliament.
Despite his reservations, the president fulfilled his constitutional obligation by calling a session of the NA to put an end to the ongoing speculations and debates.
Earlier, the National Assembly Secretariat has convened the inaugural session of the lower house of Parliament at 10am on Thursday.
In a notification issued by NA Secretary Tahir Hussain, it was disclosed that Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has granted approval for the session under Article 91(2) of the Constitution.
The decision follows consultations with the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs and the Ministry of Law.
The political landscape has seen a shift towards a smoother transition as typically, a parliament's duration spans from one general election to the next.

However, the preceding NA marked the third instance of a legislative body completing a full five-year term, demonstrating a seamless transition even though it was dissolved merely three days before reaching its scheduled conclusion.
This marked a departure from the historical trend where no prime minister managed to stay in office for the complete five years, and assemblies before 2008 failed to fulfil their constitutional terms.
Even though the assembly successfully concluded its five-year term from 2018 to 2023, it was punctuated by the unprecedented instance of a prime minister – in this case, PTI founding chairman Imran Khan – being removed through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022.
The void left by this departure was swiftly occupied by PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, who, as the joint candidate of the opposition alliance at the time, assumed the role of the premier before subsequently dissolving it in August 2023.
Subsequently, the era of the caretaker government commenced, originally intended to span three months. However, it established a novel precedent by extending its term to six months due to the inability to conduct general elections within the constitutionally mandated period of 90 days.
However, the general elections were ultimately held on February 8, and amid allegations of rigging, they concluded with a split mandate.
This forced the major political parties to opt for wheeling and dealing following which the PML-N, PPP, MQM-P and others are set to form the federal government.

Once again, Shehbaz is the joint candidate of a newly stitched alliance of the PML-N, PPP, and MQM-P as well as others, and is expected to become the premier for the second time.
His previous stint lasted for only 16 months as the government had come to complete the term.
Despite the ‘hiccups’, the tradition of the NA completing the five-year term has been going smoothly since 2008.
Usually, the five-year terms are nothing less than a rollercoaster ride, and this time around the turbulence started even before taking the first step as President Dr Arif Alvi refused to call the inaugural session of the assembly on grounds that the reserved seats for women and minorities should be first distributed among the parties as per law.
The refusal prompted the outgoing NA Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to call the maiden sitting of the lower house of parliament on February 29.
On that day, the newly-elected lawmakers will be sworn in to mark the beginning of the tenure of the assembly.
If the NA session is held on February 29, the schedule for the new speaker will be released on the same day after the MNAs-elect are sworn in.
Subsequently, on March 1, the papers for the speaker's election will be submitted to the NA secretary, On March 2, the speaker and their deputy will be elected.
This way, the process for submitting the nomination papers for the election of the prime minister is slated for March 3. This is followed by the premier’s election in the NA on March 4.
Subsequently, the Election Commission of Pakistan is then expected to hold the election for the president on March 9 -- just two days before half of the senators would complete their six-year term and replaced by elected new ones.
