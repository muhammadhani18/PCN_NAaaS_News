• Blinken presses Tel Aviv to avoid harming civilians in Gaza
THE HAGUE: Israel and South Africa face off at the UN’s top court from Thursday, after Pretoria accused Israel of “genocidal acts” in Gaza, charges the Israelis have dismissed as “blood libel”.
In an 84-page submission to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa urged judges to order Israel to “immediately suspend its military operations” in Gaza.
South Africa alleges that Israel “has engaged in, is engaging in, and risks further engaging in genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza”.
Israel has angrily hit back at the accusations, with government spokesman Eylon Levy vowing to fight the South African case he described as “absurd blood libel”.
Top officials from the two countries will face off in the ICJ’s Great Hall of Justice housed in the extravagant Peace Palace in The Hague.
 






The ICJ rules on disputes between states and while its decisions are legally binding, it has limited power to enforce them. The court could in theory order Israel to stop its invasion but it is highly doubtful it would be obeyed.
In March 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to “immediately suspend” its invasion of Ukraine — a directive Moscow has ignored. Johann Soufi, a lawyer and international justice expert, said there would be an “extremely significant symbolic impact” if the court ruled against Israel.
“Of course there is the problem of implementing the decision. But at the end of the day, international justice is all there is left,” said Soufi, who worked for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza.
’Criminally complicit
South Africa has filed the case against Israel because both countries have signed the UN Genocide Convention, created in 1948 as a response to the Holocaust.
Any country that has signed the convention can sue another at the ICJ if they disagree on the “interpretation, application or fulfilment” of the rules designed to prevent genocide.
South Africa said it was “acutely aware of the particular weight of responsibility in initiating proceedings against Israel for violations of the Genocide Convention”. It also “unequivocally” condemned the Hamas attack, but said “no armed attack… no matter how serious… can provide any possible justification for breaches” of the Genocide Convention.
Pretoria’s case is that Israeli action in Gaza is “intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”. It says Israel’s “genocidal acts” stem from the killing of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, forced displacement, and preventing adequate aid access, resulting in starvation.
 






South Africa wants the ICJ to impose so-called “provisional measures”, or emergency actions, while the broader case is being considered — which would probably take years.
Other measures requested by South Africa include reparations and reconstruction of Gaza, plus the safe return of displaced Palestinian refugees.
Blinken
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged Israeli leaders to avoid harming civilians and told them creation of a Palestinian state was the key to a long-term solution.
Blinken is on his fourth visit to the Middle East since Israel began its offensive against Gaza in October.
 






The Israeli air and ground assault has now killed 23,210 Palestinians and international concern is mounting.
Blinken met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Tel Aviv’s Kirya military base, and then with Netanyahu’s war cabinet.
The US diplomat stressed “the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
Earlier, Blinken held talks in Jordan, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and said that Washington’s Arab allies wanted closer relations with Israel but only if that included a “practical pathway” to a Palestinian state.

1,"‘Over 6,000 vanished trying to reach Spain in 2023’","It is the highest number since 2018, when 64,298 migrants entered the country, says charity Caminando Front­eras.","MADRID: At least 6,618 migrants died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain by sea in 2023, when record numbers headed for the Canary Islands, a migr­ants’ rights group said on Tuesday.
This “shameful” figure is almost three times the number recorded in the previous year — 2,390 — and the highest since charity Caminando Front­eras, or Walking Borders, began keeping a tally in 2007, its coordinator, Helena Maleno, told a news conference.
The total includes 384 children, according to the organisation, which compiles its figures from families of migrants who died or went missing and from official rescue statistics.
Maleno blamed the rise in migrant deaths and disappearances last year on a lack of resources for rescuers. Nearly half involved migrants who had departed for Spain from Senegal.
The vast majority of fatalities — 6,007 — took place on the Atlantic migration route.
 






The number of migrants arriving illegally in Spain in 2023 nearly doubled from the previous year, reaching 56,852, according to interior ministry figures.
That was the highest number since 2018, when 64,298 migrants entered the country.
The majority, about 70 per cent, arrived in the Canary Islands, which, at their closest point, are barely 100km from the northwest coast of Africa.
‘Saved lives’
The direct journey from Senegal to the Canaries usually takes a week of difficult upwind sailing of around 1,600km.
Spain’s central government in October pledged an aid package worth 50 million euros ($54m) to help the archipelago cope with the surge in arrivals.
Spanish Interior Minis­ter Fernando Grande-Marlaska said on Thursday this cooperation with African nations had stopped the departure of more than 27,000 would-be migrants to Spain last year.
“We have saved lives,” he claimed.

Gabriel Attal

 
PARIS: French leader Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday picked Gabriel Attal as prime minister in a bid to give new momentum to his presidency, with the 34-year-old becoming France’s youngest and first openly gay head of government. 
Following days of speculation, Macron late Monday accepted the resignation of Elisabeth Borne, 62, who stepped down along with the rest of the government after serving less than two years in office. 
The overhaul comes ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris and European parliament elections this summer, where Macron’s centrist forces risk defeat at the hands of the far-right under Marine Le Pen. 
A wider cabinet reshuffle is expected this week as Macron seeks to sharpen his team for the final three years of his presidency. 
“The president of the republic appointed Mr Gabriel Attal prime minister, and tasked him with forming a government,” a presidential statement said. 
Attal is set to bring a major change of style to the office of the prime minister following Borne, only the second woman to lead the French government.
Confirming the move on X, the president said he wanted the new premier to bring back the spirit of bold change from when Macron first won office on wave of hope for radical reform in 2017. 
‘Fragile as ever’ 
The appointment of Attal had been expected after Borne’s resignation on Monday, although the absence of a swift announcement fuelled talk that heavy-weight government figures were unhappy over the meteoric promotion of a man known sometimes by fellow ministers as “young Gabriel”. 
Sources close to those said to be behind the tensions, including Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, vehemently denied this.
Borne’s resignation letter to Macron, a copy of which was seen by AFP, hinted that she would have preferred to stay in her job. 
Commentators see the reshuffle as essential to relaunch Macron’s centrist presidency for its last three years and prevent him becoming a “lame duck” leader after a series of crises. 
Since he defeated the far right to win a second term in 2022, Macron has faced protests over unpopular pension reforms, the loss of his overall majority in parliamentary elections and controversy over immigration legislation. 
With Macron unable to run again in 2027 presidential elections, ministers have publicly aired concerns that Le Pen has her best chance to win the presidency.
Attal will go toe-to-toe ahead of the European elections with another rising star of French politics, the even younger Jordan Bardella, just 28, who is now party leader of the far-right RN. 
The conservative daily Le Figaro said Borne was leaving a political situation “that remains as fragile as ever. 
“Changing a face at the top doesn’t change the overall picture,” the newspaper said, adding Borne’s successor was facing “an overwhelming pile of political emergencies” including the task to unite a fragmented nation. 
‘Offensive strategy’ 
Under the French system, the president sets general policies and the prime minister is responsible for day-to-day government management, meaning the latter often pays the price when an administration runs into turbulence. 
Constitutional expert Benjamin Morel told AFP that Attal’s appointment signals a “very offensive strategy with a view to the European elections” in June. 
But political scientist Bruno Cautres said he would “not solve the problem of the majority, nor the main problem which is where the mandate (of Macron) is heading”. 
Other key posts are also subject to uncertainty, in particular that of Darmanin, 41, a right-winger said to covet the post of foreign minister held by Catherine Colonna.
The new head of government will be the fourth prime minister since 2017 under Macron, who is accused by critics of micro-managing and centralising power in the Elysee.

3,"Pakistan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia discuss collaboration in military technologies","Call for pooling resources to achieve shared objectives, attain self-sufficiency in defence sector.","ISLAMABAD: In a significant move to bolster military cooperation, Pakistan, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia held discussions on potential collaboration in military technologies, according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.
The talks took place at the second meeting of the Trilateral Defence Industrial Collaboration, which was convened at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. This meeting follows the inaugural session of the committee held in Riyadh last August. The forum had been established to enhance cooperation in the field of defence among the three countries.
“The meeting provided an opportunity to discuss prospective collaboration in defence equipment technologies, including research and development,” the ISPR said.
The three countries emphasised the importance of pooling intellectual, technical, financial, and human resources to achieve shared objectives and attain self-sufficiency in the defence sector. They acknowledged their historical ties and reiterated their strategic intent to expand the scope of trilateral cooperation. The need to accelerate collaboration efforts in pursuit of common goals was also underscored.

Call for pooling resources to achieve shared objectives, attain self-sufficiency in defence sector

The three sides resolved to hold the next meeting on Trilateral Defence Industrial Collaboration during the World Defence Show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, scheduled for February 2024. This continued dialogue marks a significant step in strengthening defence ties and technological collaboration between Pakistan, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia.

On the sidelines of the trilateral dialogue, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia conducted their bilateral defence collaboration meeting, marking the third edition of the Pakistan-KSA Defence Collaboration Committee discussions, according to ISPR.
During the meeting, the participants engaged in detailed discussions on issues of bilateral interest and the evolving global security environment. The two sides focused their deliberations on the rapid advancements in military technologies and emphasised the necessity for defence industrial cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to fulfill shared objectives.
Both countries expressed a strong mutual desire to enhance defence cooperation across all domains, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in defence production. The forum also highlighted the importance of exploring further avenues for defence cooperation and accelerating the pace of their collaborative efforts.
This meeting underscores the growing defence relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and reflects their commitment to deepening bilateral ties in the defense sector, addressing modern challenges, and collaborating on technological advancements.

4,Smriti Irani visits holy sites during ‘historic’ Madina visit,Rajnath in UK for talks on ‘military collaboration’,"LONDON: An Indian delegation led by Minority Affairs Minister Smriti Irani visited Madina and other holy sites over the weekend as part of her two-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Indian media outlets have reported.
Ms Irani — who is also the women and child development minister — travelled to Madina along with Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan and other senior officials, according to The Indian Express.
The delegation also interacted with Indian volunteers “who provide dedicated and selfless service to Indian Haj pilgrims, including during Haj 2023” and Umrah pilgrims from India.
Ms Irani shared photos from her visit in a post shared on social media platform X on Monday, and said: “Undertook a historic journey to Medina today, one of Islam’s holiest cities included a visit to the periphery of the revered Prophet’s [peace be upon him] Mosque, Al Masjid Al Nabwi, the mountain of Uhud, and periphery of the Quba Mosque — the first Mosque of Islam.”

Rajnath in UK for talks on ‘military collaboration’

She added that the significance of the visit to these sites “intertwined with early Islamic history” and “underscores the depth of our cultural and spiritual engagement”.
She also attended the inauguration ceremony of the third Haj and Umrah Conference in Jeddah.
Until 2021, non-Muslims were not allowed to visit Madina, after which a relaxation of rules allowed them to visit the city centre up to the periphery of the Masjid-i-Nabwi.
The visit followed an agreement between India and Saudi Arabia, under which New Delhi was allocated a quota of 175,025 pilgrims for the annual Haj pilgrimage in 2024, The Indian Express reported.
Rajnath visits UK
Separately, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh began a two-day visit to the United Kingdom on Tuesday, with reports suggesting discussions on possible collaborations for military equipment between the two countries.
Mr Singh is the first Indian defence minister to have visited the UK in 22 years, and his trip is being viewed as a “significant improvement in bilateral ties” between the two countries.
Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, a senior fellow for South and Central Asian defence, strategy and diplomacy at London’s International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said the visit is significant despite differences between India and the UK on the Russia-Ukraine war.
“...defence technological and industrial partnerships, a key objective of India’s efforts to boost self-reliance in arms production, remains challenging with the reluctance of the UK defence industry to engage boldly with India, unlike their counterparts in the US and France,” Mr Roy-Chaudhury wrote in an analysis for Indian publication The Wire. 
He added that Mr Singh’s visit “could prove pivotal by progressing significant collaborative projects at a political level”. 
This could include the co-development of gas-turbine propulsion technology by Rolls-Royce and India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation for the next generation of Indian fighter aircraft engines.
He noted that the UK government supports India’s plans to develop its defence industry, but “in practice, no significant India-UK collaboration regarding defence capabilities has occurred as yet”.
“Additional challenges could include the emergence of firm evidence on allegations of official Indian involvement in targeted assassinations/assassination attempts in the US and Canada, as well as a rise in Sikh separatist (Khalistani) extremism in the UK,” the scholar added.

5,Judges question Trump’s immunity claim in poll subversion case,Ex-president warns he could prosecute Biden if returns to White House.," 

Donald Trump

WASHINGTON: A Washington appeals court questioned Donald Tru­mp’s claims that he is immune from criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election, as the former US president on Tuesday warned he could prosecute Joe Biden if he returns to the White House.
Trump looked on as his legal team sought to convince a panel of three judges that former presidents should not be prosecuted for actions they took in office. Trump is due to go to trial in March on federal charges of election subversion.
Judges reacted sceptically to that argument.
“You’re saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could tell SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival?” Judge Florence Pan asked Trump’s lawyer D. John Sauer.

Ex-president warns he could prosecute Biden if returns to White House

Sauer said that a former president could be charged for such conduct only if they were first impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted in the Senate.
 
 

Trump did not address the court, or speak to news media that waited outside the courthouse. He did, however, confer quietly with his attorneys several times during the hearing.
With the Republican state-by-state presidential nominating contest due to kick off next week, Trump used the hearing as an opportunity to claim he is the victim of political persecution.
In a video posted to social media ahead of the hearing, Trump said he could prosecute Democ­ratic President Joe Biden if he wins the November presidential election.
“If I don’t get immunity then crooked Joe Biden doesn’t get immunity,” Trump said. “Joe would be ripe for indictment.”
Trump, who lost to Biden in the 2020 election, has opened up a commanding lead over his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination since the first criminal charge against him was announced last March. He is expected to easily win Monday’s contest in Iowa.
Pandora’s box
The US Justice Department has long held that presidents cannot be prosecuted while in office for doing their official duties. Trump, the first former U.S. president to be criminally prosecuted, faces 91 criminal counts in four separate cases.
 
 

Sauer, Trump’s lawyer, told a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that allowing prosecution to go forward would lead to a cycle of retribution after each election and “open a Pandora’s Box from which that nation may never recover.”
He said presidents must first be impeached and removed from office by Congress before he could be prosecuted. Trump was impeached twice but the Senate failed to convict him.
‘Not above the law’
The case against Trump reflects the unprecedented nature of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and granting him immunity for those actions would give future presidents license to commit crimes, Justice Department lawyer James Pearce told the panel.
“The president has a unique constitutional role, but he is not above the law,” he said.
Both the legal outcome and timing of the appeals court’s ruling will play a pivotal role in determining whether Trump faces trial ahead of the Nov 5, 2024, election.
