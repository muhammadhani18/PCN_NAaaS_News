However, the area police expressed ignorance about the raids and subsequent arrests.
Videos widely shared on social media showed a number of policemen surrounding the houses of Nisar Panwhar and his son Mohsin and Advocate Jauhar Abid in Saadi Town and Gulshan-i-Iqbal, respectively, and then taking them away.
The trio had filed nomination papers for contesting the Feb 8 general election as independent candidates but the returning officers concerned rejected them. They approached election tribunals which allowed them to contest the polls.
In a statement, the coordination committee of the MQM-L claimed that they were arrested only to stop them from contesting the elections.
The party urged the chief justice of Pakistan and chief election commissioner to take notice of the ‘arrests’ and ensure their immediate release.
It questioned as to what kind of level-playing field was provided by the election authorities when independent candidates were being picked up just to prevent them from contesting the polls.
Meanwhile, Gulshan SP Farhat Kamal said the police did not arrest Advocate Abid. 
Dawn approached SSP-East Irfan Bahadur for his version, but he did not respond.
Only on Monday, the nomination papers of Nisar Panwhar and Advocate Abid were accepted from NA-231 and NA-248 constituencies by an election tribunal.

1,Caretaker CM Baqar seeks end to menace of illegal construction,Orders demolition of multi-storey building near Star Gate.,"• Orders demolition of multi-storey building near Star Gate
• Seeks details of all illegal structures in Karachi
• Reviews steps for beautification of Sharea Faisal          
KARACHI: Expressing grave concern and displeasure over the construction of illegal buildings along Sharea Faisal and other areas of Karachi, caretaker Chief Minister retired Justice Maqbool Baqar has directed the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) to immediately demolish such structures across the city and take stern action against officials who approved the layout plans of such constructions or deliberately ignored them.
The city has transformed into a concrete jungle, mainly due to excessive commercialisation and poor planning as the number of illegally-raised building has been increasing with each passing year, with officials of SBCA actively conniving with the builders. Despite the Sindh High Court’s frequently taking exception to the mushroom growth of illegal and unauthorised construction in the city, the issue remains unchanged.
Chairing a follow-up meeting regarding the beautification of the Sharea Faisal and restoration of Chaukhandi Graveyard, the chief minister pointed out to a multi-storey building being constructed near Star Gate and ordered its immediate demolition as it was found extended out near the main road.
Informed sources said that the chief minister expressed annoyance over the construction of illegal buildings in the city, including those along the city’s main artery, and directed SBCA chief Ishaq Khuhro to submit within 15 days a detailed report on the construction of such buildings across the city.
The sources said that the SBCA chief was asked to give details of buildings so far demolished since the establishment of caretaker set up in the province.
They said that he was also asked to give in his report the details of the permissions granted for building construction during the caretaker government.
A statement from the CM House said that the meeting was attended, among others, by Sports & Antiquities Minister Dr Junaid Shah, Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh, Forest Secretary Najam Shah, Culture Secretary Khalid Chachar, Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Rajput, Architects Ali Naqvi and Ms Komal Pervez and Consultant Dr Kaleem Lashari.
It said that the CM pointed out that a building opposite Star Gate was being built but encroached on the service road. He directed the SBCA chief to bulldoze the building and take strict action against the officer responsible for the illegal construction.
As for the beautification of the Sharea Faisal, the commissioner informed the CM that a wall had been erected in front of Falaknaz Apartments, adding that the wall would be beautified with stone carving work and tiles showing different cultural colours of Sindh.
A spot was identified at the corner of the road going to Jinnah Terminal for which the CM decided that the KMC would develop a park there.
The CM also decided that the underpass at Drigh Road would also be beautified with lights, paints and installation of different tiles.
It was decided that the two flyovers located on the Sharea Faisal would also be beautified with tiles, paints and greenery. Sitting areas would be developed under the flyovers/bridges.
Mayor Murtaza Wahab told the CM that the green belt of Sharea Faisal was being beautified with plantation of trees and seasonal flowers, and that beautiful grills would also be installed there.
The chief minister directed DG SBCA to urgently move the builder of the Falaknaz Apartments to repair and renovate his buildings and treat their seepage.
Since its induction, the caretaker provincial government has attempted to control the menace but to no avail as the mechanism of corruption for granting permissions for building construction, commonly known as ‘system’, is still reported to be operative in the SBCA.
Even caretaker Local Government Minister Mubin Jumani during his introductory meeting with LG department had said that the city had been turned into a jungle of concrete, directing the SBCA chief to independently initiate immediate action against all ‘systems’ including ‘illegal construction system’.
Chaukhandi Graveyard
The CM was given detailed presentations on the progress made so far in the restoration of the Chaukhandi Graveyard by the commissioner, architects and the secretaries of culture and forest departments.
The commissioner told the CM that the trucks/containers parked along the access road had been removed and the cleanliness of the graveyard and its surrounding areas was in progress.
The forest secretary told the CM that the social forestry division had been assigned the task of conserving the graveyard. He pointed out that 800 different species of plants, shrubs and trees existed in the graveyard. They include Imli, Mango, Zaitoon, suhanjha, badam, Anjeer, Beri and others.
The CM was told that the forest department would plant 50,000 trees at the graveyard, including 5,000 neem, 13,000 of Gulmohar, 500 peepals, 4,000 Imli and others.
It was pointed out that plantation was the best way to prevent the archaeological site from erosion and exposure to weather.
Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that the KMC would develop a park at Chaukhandi Graveyard so that visitors could enjoy a proper sitting place.
Architect Ms Komal also gave a presentation about the master plan and landscape of the site and told the CM that she had submitted the master plan to the culture department.
The technical team of the project informed the CM that they had completed the documentation and survey of graves and canopies. They pointed out that 225 graves were in good condition, 275 were partially damaged and 199 were in dilapidated condition.
The chief minister desired that the design, features, financial implications, and hiring of artisans be finalised and carried out by the culture department.

2,Another challenge to Shehbaz’s candidature dismissed,Tribunal allows two sons of Fehmida Mirza to contest polls.,"• Tribunal allows two sons of Fehmida Mirza to contest polls
• SHC dismisses petition against candidature of PTI’s Firdous Naqvi        


Shehbaz Sharif

 
KARACHI: An election tribunal on Tuesday dismissed another appeal against acceptance of the nomination papers of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president Shehbaz Sharif and allowed him to contest the Feb 8 election from a Karachi National Assembly constituency (NA-242 Keamari-I).
The tribunal, headed by Justice Arshad Hussain Khan of the Sindh High Court, rejected the election appeal filed by a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf candidate after hearing parties concerned and upheld the decision of the returning officer (RO).
Citing the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), district returning officer (DRO), RO and Mr Sharif as respondents, Mr Chohan submitted that he had filed objections against the nomination papers of PML-N president, but the RO did not give any heed to them.
The appellant contended that Mr Sharif had submitted his nomination paper on Dec 22, 2023 in which he allegedly concealed several facts, showed incorrect assets details, etc.
The appellant submitted that the impugned order was passed by the RO in a hasty manner without considering his objections.
Alleging that the PML-N president could not be considered as ‘sadiq and ameen’ in terms of Article 62 of the Constitution due to misdeclaration, he pleaded to set aside the order of the RO and reject the nomination papers of Mr Sharif.
However, the tribunal dismissed his appeal and maintained the RO’s order.
On Monday, another election tribunal had dismissed an appeal filed by a Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate against acceptance of nomination papers of the former prime minister.
Fehmida’s sons allowed to contest polls
The same tribunal on Tuesday allowed the appeals of Hasnain Mirza and Hassam Mirza, sons of Dr Fehmida and Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, against rejection of their nomination papers from PS-70 (Badin-III) and NA-223 (Badin-II), respectively.
On Monday, an election tribunal had dismissed the appeals of their parents and maintained the decision of the ROs who had rejected the couple’s nomination papers from NA-223, PS-70, PS-71 and PS-72.
The tribunal also turned down an appeal filed against the candidature of former provincial minister and PPP leader Saeed Ghani.
Appellant Arsalan Khan, said to be a voter of the PS-105, filed the appeal after the RO had accepted the nomination papers of the PPP leader.
Petition of MQM-P candidate dismissed
The SHC on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed against the candidature of PTI leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi.
Initially, the RO had dismissed the nomination papers of Mr Naqvi from NA-236 (Karachi East-II) after his rival candidate filed objections. On Jan 4, an election tribunal had allowed the appeal of the PTI leader and overturned the decision of RO.
However, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s candidate Hassan Sabir, who had submitted objections before the RO, filed a petition against the order of the election tribunal.
After hearing arguments from both sides, a two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudary dismissed the petition.
Meanwhile, the same bench on Tuesday allowed another PTI candidate to contest the Feb 8 general elections.
Dr Masroor Sial filed two petitions against the decisions of the election tribunal for rejecting his appeals against the orders of the ROs.
The ROs had rejected his papers from NA- 230 (Malir-I) and NA-231 (Malir-II) and subsequently, the tribunal had also turned down his appeals.
The division bench allowed both the petitions and overturned the orders of tribunals.

3,Lab confirms two of six air passengers  tested positive for JN.1 varaint,"Sindh health dept issues advisory, calls for taking preventive measures against new variant.","KARACHI: Two of the six air passengers, who were found to have Covid during screening at the Jinnah International Airport, have tested positive for JN.1 variant, currently a cause of concern in several countries.
The passengers, one of them a resident of Kech in Balochistan, and the other of Qasimabad in Hyderabad, had arrived in Karachi from Abu Dhabi and Bangkok, respectively. 
Their samples for genome sequencing had been sent to a lab of the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) after they tested positive for Covid at the airport. 
“We are in contact with the passengers. Their condition is stable,” a health department spokesperson said, adding that the families had been advised to get themselves tested for Covid.
“The airport authorities have been asked to resume the public service announcement system on Covid so that passengers start wearing masks and ensure physical distancing and hand hygiene to reduce the infection risk during travel.”

Sindh health dept issues advisory, calls for taking preventive measures against new variant 

Meanwhile, the health department has released an advisory, directing district health officials and medical superintendents across the province to identify and notify individuals who have been in close contact with the confirmed cases and ensure proper treatment to the patients.
The directives also included the establishment of a Covid ward at the district and taluka hospitals and providing the facility for vaccination against the disease.
It might be recalled that six air passengers have so far been tested positive for the new Covid variant in the country. Four of the patients, according to the federal health ministry, have recovered.
According to experts, the JN.1 variant, also called a sub-variant of the Omicron lineage, is more transmissible than other circulating variants, and the proportion of cases caused by this particular virus has been rising.

They said that assailants targeted Syed Shakeel Sher, 42, when he was passing through the Liaquatabad area in his car.
Mr Sher, who worked with a private firm as an accountant, died on the spot, Sharifabad SHO Jameel Rehman said, adding that the killers did not take away anything from the victim.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for a post-mortem examination.
Central SSP Faisal Abdullah Chachar said that the murder appeared to be an incident of ‘targeted killing”. However, the police were investigating the case to ascertain the exact motive for the killing, he added.
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the victim suffered a single bullet wound in the chest.
The SSP said that investigators collected two spent bullet casings fired from a 9mm pistol from the crime scene.
In another incident, a rickshaw driver was killed on the main Dr Salimuz Zaman Siddiqui Road, popularly known as Suparco Road, near Dow University Hospital (Ojha campus).

KARACHI: The final-year thesis show of the students at the Arts Council of Pakistan’s Institute of Arts and Crafts constitutes of striking artworks made by the young boys and girls belonging to the departments of fine art, textile design, graphic design and communication design. 
Paintings and sculptures (in the fine art category) are on view at the Ahmed Pervez Gallery while works representing the other two categories are placed in Haseena Moin Hall. 
It is such a delight to see the young artists — 31 in total out of which three have speech and hearing impairments — expressing themselves with the kind of abandon that’s essential to grow as creative souls. 
It has to be said that in no time, the institute has managed to come out with artists who, for sure, have a bright future in a field in which Pakistan has already, in recent times, made its presence felt on a global scale. 
Since it is difficult to point out individuals due to the large number of works on view, in general, one is impressed with the way the participating youngsters have used a considerable variety of media to put across an equally wide range of ideas.
Inaugurating the exhibition, writer Anwar Maqsood, who himself is a top-notch painter, said, “After a long time I have seen such good work. This [council’s] building needs to be celebrated because here all sorts of art-related activities — dance, music, painting etc — can take place.” 
Caretaker Information Minister and Arts Council president Ahmed Shah said, “In the last one or two years, the Arts Council has produced a big number of young artists, a feat that not even reputed [art] institutes have been able to achieve. We are going to begin masters’ course for the students in order for them to move ahead in terms of innovation and creativity.” 
The show concludes on Wednesday (today).

Mr Sheikh, along with three identified and 150 unidentified party activists, was booked for allegedly holding a violent protest on the M-9 motorway in March 2023 in protest over a police siege of PTI chairman Imran Khan’s Lahore residence.
The case was registered at the Sachal police station under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offense committed on prosecution of a common object), 427 (mischief causing damage), and 186 (obstructing a public servant in the discharge of public functions) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

The magistrate remanded all the suspects to physical custody for three days and directed the IO to submit a progress report along with the suspects on the next hearing scheduled for Jan 12.
During the hearing, the IO submitted an application before the court to record the statements of the prosecution witnesses under Section 164 CrPC. The court rejected the request because the IO failed to satisfy the court and also both witnesses had already recorded their statements under Section 161 CrPC, supporting the version of the FIR.
Wasim Siddiqui (JI worker) was gunned down by armed assailants near Jamaatul Mursaleen Masjid, Orangi Town on Jan 2.
According to police, they have managed to arrest, using technical and human intelligence, three “hired assassins” and two others who gave the contract (supari) of killing.
The police identified the victim’s relatives as Waseem and Shahzeb.
They had given Rs300,000 to Zafar, Majid and Ahad for killing the JI worker over some personal enmity, the spokesperson said in a statement.

He stated that he came to know that Shahid Nizamani and Farooq Nizamani alias Kako were to announced their quitting of the GDA and joining the PPP for which a programme was arranged at the Nizamani House and certain PPP leaders were about arrive. 
The SHO stated that when reached the troubled spot, he saw some 100 to 150 residents of Nizamani Muhalla, including women and children, having assembled outside the Nizamani House. They were carrying clubs, bricks and stones and had blocked the road and denying free movement to vehicles and pedestrians, he claimed, and added that the demonstrators were shouting that they would not allow any PPP leader or their vehicles to pass through the road.
The SHO further stated that he tried to persuade the demonstrators, who had lit bonfire in the middle of the road, to disperse peacefully and clear the road but in vain. They also stopped police from discharging their official duties, he said.

PPP leaders condemn incident
Shazia Marri along with Naveed Dero, Aajiz Dhamrah and other PPP leaders spoke to the media on Monday night to condemn the episode. She described the demonstration to block access to the Nizamani House as a shameful act.
She said that such activities were a clear violation of the code of conduct prescribed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
She also criricised the caretaker government failure to ensure an environment conducive to peaceful electioneering and free and fair elections. She observed that the police failed to control a handful of people indulging in the unlawful act.
She urged the ECP to take notice of the pre-planned attempt to disturb the political situation in Sanghar.
She alleged that the assistant returning officers of NA-209, PS-40 and PS-41 were disciples of [GDA leader] Pir Pagara.

Abdul Ghaffar Nizamani, one of the suspects nominated in the FIR, denied having been among the demonstrators and condemned the police for naming him in the case.  
He maintained that he, being a media worker and social activist, was present there for coverage.

PPP has finalised names of its candidates for all constituencies of Hyderabad but NA-220 (Hyderabad city). “The party leadership is talking to Owais Noorani Siddiqui on this seat,” said Sindh PPP information secretary Ajiz Dhamra, who is himself the party’s candidate for PS-64 (Hyderabad city). 
He had lost this seat to MQM-P in 2018 polls.
PPP had withdrawn its candidate, Dr Irfan Gul Magsi, from NA-220 in favour of JUP-Noorani leader Sahibzada Abul Khair Mohammad Zubair in 2018 polls. Zubair had lost to MQM-P. 
“I am holding talks with all parties including PPP for adjustment on seats,” said Noorani over phone. His father had contested general elections from Hyderabad in 1988 and then in 1993 but lost to MQM-P’s Aftab Ahmed Shaikh.
In 2002 general elections late Noorani had nominated Zubair as Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal candidate for the city’s constituency. Zubair had defeated MQM’s Aftab Ahmed Sheikh by a small margin along with MMA’s Abdul Rehman Rajput who also trounced MQM-P’s late Farooq Qureshi on PS-45.
Presently, Noorani and Zubair lead their separate factions of JUP. Jan 12 is last date for withdrawal of candidatures. It was learnt that Noorani had sought adjustments on NA-220 and PS-65 but PPP had finalised the name of Haji Fareed Qureshi for PS-65 and kept its decision pending on NA-220. 
Dr Magsi has applied for this seat again. Noorani believed that recent delimitations might favour him on NA-220.

Shah told participants in a procession organised by his party in Salehpat town on Tuesday that Supreme Court of Pakistan had left no doubt in minds about the polls and given very clear passage that general elections would be definitely held in the country. 
He urged political parties to leave politics of drawing room and take the field for polls. As time had changed now, no one could get himself or herself elected by getting ballot papers stamped for him or her, he said in a sarcastic tone.
He said that wherever they were going for electioneering, they had to inform people of their performance. Dictators too should be asked about their performance of 40 years. “The dictators spent 700 billion dollars during the 40 years. If such huge amount of money had been spent on Pakistani industries, many problems could have been resolved undoubtedly,” he said.
He said that PPP did not do power politics. “Rather, we want powerful government of people which can resolve problems of people and the country,” he said.
Shah said that PPP wanted to bring smiles and lights on peoples’ faces. When the party came to power, it would resolve electricity problem by providing solar plates to people, he said.
He told party workers that PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had promised that minimum wages of the poor would be doubled to at least Rs50,000. Under the party’s rule in the province, 28 water channels had been built, which irrigated 150,000 acres of barren land, he said, adding that more water channels would be built and fortified when the party came to power for five years, he said.
He said that PPP founder gave constitution to the country and refused to leave his land when he was pressured to do so by the martial law regime. Those who defeated death lived forever and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had defeated death, said Shah, adding Bhutto never bowed his head before tyrants.
He said that Benazir Bhutto came back for people despite serious threats to her life and was made to pay the price with her life. They had done a lot but still much had to be done for people, he said and claimed that he had never told lies, nor done hypocrisy or put someone in jails.

15,Literary moot calls for promoting book reading habit,THATTA: Speakers at a literature festival organised under the aegis of Sindh University Thatta Campus here on ...,"THATTA: Speakers at a literature festival organised under the aegis of Sindh University Thatta Campus here on Tuesday highlighted importance of reading books and said quality literature and habit of reading can transform a backward people into a progressive society.
They praised the university’s efforts for promoting literary activities in the historical district of Sindh.
Historian and educationist Dr Abdul Ghafoor Memon said that Thatta had a glorious past in education and being a centre of knowledge but it had now lost contact with the modern world due to unavailability of facilities and youth’s alienation from literature. “Our girls are unaware of the modern methodologies of learning,” he said.
He said the girls should be provided equal opportunities. Quality literature and habit of book reading could transform a backward people into a progressive society, he said. 
Prof Dr Arfana Malah observed that love of literature would inculcate decency in society. It quelled differences between different sections of society. “We have to be more forward looking and put Sindh on the path to constant progress,” she proposed.
“The literary gatherings remind us of the contribution of our heroes to literature. Women in remote areas should come out of their homes so that objective of a progressive society can be achieved,” she said.
Dr Mohammad Ali Manji called for female education and urged authorities concerned to take measures for spreading the message of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai who advanced revolutionary ideas of transforming society.
Renowned writer and poet Engineer Obhayo Khan Khushk also spoke. The festival also featured stalls for books, traditional foods and embroidery. Towards the end of the event, students presented tableaus on different social issues.
