• Accountability court dismisses his bail in Toshakhana, Al-Qadir Trust cases
• Former PM says he is being punished for ‘reining in powerful quarters’
ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested by Ra­w­a­lpindi police in at least a dozen cases pertaining to the May 9 violence, including the attack on the Gene­ral Headqua­rters (GHQ), as an accountability court in Islamabad ind­icted him and former first lady Bus­hra Bibi in the Toshakhana reference on Tuesday.
As per the charge sheet, the former PTI chairman retained 58 out of 108 gifts received from different heads of states during his tenure as the premier. The court charged Mr Khan with securing these gifts at ‘throwaway’ prices.
The judge adjourned further proceedings till Jan 11 in the Toshakhana reference and summoned 12 witnesses on the same date. It alleged that Bushra Bibi kept the exquisite and expensive jewellery set bypassing Toshakhana rules. The military secretary, however, had reported this gift in 2020.
 
 

As per the list of the prosecution, two senior army officers, including the ex-military secretary to the former premier, will testify in this case, whereas private appraiser Sohaib Abbasi has also become an approver against Mr Khan.
Witnesses named by the prosecution included Mr Khan’s ex-military secretary Brig Muhammad Ahmed, Deputy Military Secretary Colonel Rehan Mehmood, Toshakhana section officers Benaymin, Nida Rehman, NAB Addi­ti­onal Director Qaiser Mehmood, State Bank of Pakistan Joint Director Sajid Khan, Assistant Secretary Protocol Zahid Sarfraz Azam, Principal Appraiser Azeem Man­zoor, Appraiser Rabia Samad, Deputy Consulate General at Dubai Rahi­mullah, Counselor Att­ache Irfan Rafaqat, Moh­sin Habib Admin Assistant at the Dubai Consulate, former private secretary Syed Inamullah Shah, Magistrate Mohammad Abdullah, NAB officials Mohsin Haroon, Mustansar Imam Shah, and Hasnain Mustafa.
Talking to the media at Adiala Jail, Mr Khan said that he was being victimised for “reining in the powerful quarters”. He said that the witnesses against him included an office boy. In response to a question about PTI’s support for Sheikh Rashid, Mr Khan said that the party would make a decision soon.
On the other hand, the Rawalpindi Police arre­sted Imran Khan in connection with the May 9 protests. The anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawal­pindi granted a two-day phy­sical remand of Mr Khan and directed the pol­ice to investigate him at Adiala Jail.
Dismissal of bail plea
Accountability judge Mohammad Bashir on Tuesday dismissed the petitions of Mr Khan seeking post-arrest bail in the Toshakhana reference and Al-Qadir Trust case involving 190 million pounds. Likewise, the court adjourned proceedings in 190m pounds corruption case till Jan 17. Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi are likely to be indicted in this case on the said date.
In a related development, the written order of the same court regarding the attachment of the properties of property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son Ahmed Ali Riaz and other accused has been issued.
As per the court order, Malik Riaz’s six properties in Revenue Estate Kotha Kalan and Bimia Kanet in Rawalpindi and 11 bank accounts in Rawalpindi and Islamabad were attached.
‘Imran authored article’
Meanwhile, the PTI has issued a clarification regarding coverage of Mr Khan’s media talk regarding an essay published in The Economist. The spokesman stated that “the said piece has been authored by the PTI chairman-for-life” and “in no way, this has been compiled through the use of artificial means including artificial intelligence”.

1,Campaigning on hold as PML-N sorts out ticket dilemma,"Despite Nawaz’s clearance from all cases, party yet to embark on campaign trail; leaders ""more concerned"" with securing tickets.","• Despite Nawaz’s clearance from all cases, party yet to embark on campaign trail
• Leaders ‘more concerned’ with securing tickets; move to accommodate IPP leaders ‘divides’ Sharif camp
LAHORE: With less than a month to go for the general election, PML-N is yet to kick-start its campaign as it is still sorting out ticket distribution and seat adjustment with the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and PML-Q.
The party appears to be in no rush regarding the launch of its election campaign, and the confidence is apparently due to their “good equation” with the powers that be.
For now, the party’s only concern appears to be getting its candidates right for the national and provincial assemblies’ seats, especially in Punjab.
This is in stark contrast with the charged campaign by the PML-N’s erstwhile ally, the PPP, whose Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari remained in Lahore last week, openly campaigning in the city’s NA-127 constituency and calling out the Sharifs almost daily.
Unperturbed by this, the PML-N leadership, for now, is apparently co­n­tent with ‘public addresses’ in indoor party meetings and media statements.
“Either the leadership knows that the polls are not taking place on Feb 8, or it is confident that only a couple of weeks will be enough for canvassing to emerge as the majority party,” a PML-N leader from Punjab told Dawn on Monday.
He also said that party leaders were less concerned about the election campaign and more preoccupied with securing their tickets.
“The party is likely to announce tickets for the National and Punjab ass­e­mblies in a couple of days. Perhaps after that, it may think about kicking off the election campaign.”
 
 

The leader expressed hope that the party will enter the campaign mode with the launch of its manifesto on Jan 15 or 16.
Earlier, PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal had told Dawn the party would kick-start its campaign once the appeals of former premier Nawaz Sharif were decided.
However, it has been over a month since Mr Sharif’s acquittal in Avenfield and Al-Azizia cases, but the party has yet to launch a concerted push towards electioneering.
The Supreme Court’s verdict of Monday, thro­w­ing out lifetime disqualification for lawma­kers under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, has also effectively rendered the PML-N supremo free to contest the elections.
When contacted on Monday, Mr Iqbal did not comment on the delay in his party’s election campaign.
Ticket dilemma
The party’s seat adjustment with the IPP, in particular, has exacerbated its predicament regarding the distribution of tickets.
 
 

The party is “compelled” to accommodate key candidates of IPP, and ticket distribution in this way is likely to create resentment among PML-N loyalists, as well as IPP ranks, especially in Punjab.
A source in the IPP said that the party’s president, Aleem Khan, had requested the Sharifs to ask Maryam Nawaz Sharif to vacate the NA-119 seat in Lahore for him as he had already launched his campaign from there. “However, Ms Sharif told the leadership to adjust the IPP leader in NA-117, as even this would be a favour to him,” the source said.
Similarly, IPP patron-in-chief and sugar baron Jahangir Khan Tareen is keen to contest the National Assembly election from Lodhran, but the Sharifs want him to contest from Multan. Once of the reasons is that they don’t want to provoke the ire of Sadique Baloch, a strong candidate, who has threatened to contest independently if he is not awarded a ticket from Lodhran.
Separately, Awn Chaudhry, once a close confidant of PTI leader Imran Khan and now a central IPP leader, is vying for a National Assembly seat from Lahore. “He may be considered for NA-124 as he is close to Shehbaz Sharif,” sources said.
The PML-N has reportedly told the IPP that it would not accommodate PTI members who joined the party after the May 9 attacks.
“In such a scenario, IPP will get a very limited number of national and Punjab assembly seats,” said the IPP source, adding that the party had earlier sought over 100 seats from PML-N, which in turn had termed it a “non-serious demand”.
On the PML-N’s side, the powerful Khokhar group of Lahore has reportedly managed to secure at least two national and one Punjab assembly seats.
 
 

A big financier of the party, Saiful Malook Khokhar, is also a blue-eyed leader of the party’s chief organiser, Ms Sharif.
The president of PML-N’s Lahore chapter Mr Khokhar has secured National Assembly seats for himself and his brother, Afzal Khokhar.
With a Punjab Assembly seat also secured for his relative Imran Shafi Khokhar, Mr Khokhar is said to be lobbying for the accommodation of his cousin Faisal Khokhar in the PP-168 constituency.
This has resulted in disagreements among the Sharif family, with Ms Nawaz supporting Mr Faisal and her cousin, Hamza Shahbaz, putting his weight behind a party worker, Shabbir Khokhar.
“Even in a parliamentary board meeting, a question was raised whether the leadership is surrendering to the will of the wealthy Khokhars,” a party insider said.
To placate the malcontents, the party has promised candidates who might miss out on tickets that they would be accommodated in the Senate or given tickets for by-polls, the PML-N insider told Dawn.

2,Scientists confirm 2023 was ‘hottest year on record’,"2023 marked the first time on record that every day within a year has exceeded 1°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial level, report says.","ISLAMABAD: Global temperatures reached exc­e­ptionally high levels in 2023, as the unprecede­n­ted heat from June on­­wa­rds led 2023 to become the warmest year on record — overtaking the previous warmest year, 2016, by a large margin, according to the 2023 Glo­bal Climate Highlights rep­ort released on Tuesday.
The year-to-year incre­a­se in global average temperature was exceptiona­lly large from 2022 to 2023. It follows a transition from three years of La Nina in 2020–2022 to El Nino conditions in 2023, alth­ough other factors appear to have also played a role.
 






The report says 2023 marked the first time on record that every day within a year has exceeded 1°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial level for that time of year. Nearly half the days were more than 1.5°C warmer than the 1850-1900 level, and two days in November were, for the first time, more than 2°C warmer.
Mauro Facchini, Head of Earth Observation at the Directorate General for Defence Industry and Space, European Commission, commented: “We knew thanks to the work of the Copernicus programme throughout 2023 that we would not receive good news today. But the annual data presented here provides yet more evidence of the increasing impacts of climate change.”
The ‘Copernicus Climate Change Service’ (C3S) monitored several key climate indicators throughout the year, reporting on record-breaking conditions such as the hottest month on record and daily global temperature averages briefly surpassing pre-industrial levels by more than 2C.  Copernicus is a component of the European Union’s space and earth observation programme.
 
 

The evolution of the daily global average temperature shows that 2023 is noteworthy for the occurrence of the highest global temperatures on record, both in absolute terms, during July, and relative to the annual cycle, during November. Almost all days from the beginning of June were the warmest in the ERA5 data record for that particular day of the year.
The rise in air temperature since the mid-1970s has been about twice as large over land than over ice-free ocean, but each surface accounts for about half of the rise in global average air temperature, as the area of the Earth’s surface covered by ocean is much larger than the area covered by land, the annual climate summary shows.
Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the C3S said: “2023 was an exceptional year with climate records tumbling like dominoes. Not only is 2023 the warmest year on record, it is also the first year with all days over 1°C warmer than the pre-industrial period. Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years”.
The distribution of surface air temperature anomalies across the globe in 2023 shows a marked contrast with that of 2022. Almost all land areas experienced above-average temperatures in 2023. Annual temperatures were more than 1°C higher than the 1991-2020 average over much of Europe and North America, and over several other regions.
The flagship report says marine heatwaves were a common occurrence in 2023, affecting regions such as the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the North Pacific, and much of the North Atlantic.
 
 

Greenhouse gas concentrations in 2023 reached the highest levels ever recorded in the atmosphere and carbon dioxide concentrations in 2023 were 2.4 ppm higher than in 2022 and methane concentrations increased by 11 ppb.
Globally, annual economic losses from climate- and weather-related disasters have significantly increased since the 2000s. In low and lower-middle-income countries, 82 per cent of all damage and loss caused by drought concerned the agriculture sector.
Between 2008 and 2018, across least developed countries and lower middle-income countries, 34pc of disaster-related crop and livestock production losses were attributed to drought, followed by 19pc to flooding events, 18pc to severe storms and hurricanes, 9pc to crop pests and animal diseases, 6pc to extreme temperatures, and 1pc to wildfires.

3,"ECP transgressed mandate in PTI polls case, lawyer tells PHC","• Barrister Zafar says poll watchdog is ‘record-keeper’, has no power to revoke electoral symbol • ECP lawyer rejects assertion;","• Barrister Zafar says poll watchdog is ‘record-keeper’, has no power to revoke electoral symbol
• ECP lawyer rejects assertion; claims intra-party elections were ‘pre-decided’
PESHAWAR: A PTI counsel on Tues­day argued before a Peshawar High Court bench that the Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan overstepped its jurisdiction by stripping the party of its electoral symbol ‘bat’ and nullifying its intra-party polls.
“Without the election symbol ‘bat’ the party will turn almost dormant and it cannot even field candidates on 227 seats reserved for women and non-Muslims across the country,” argued the PTI lead counsel Barrister Syed Ali Zafar before the bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali.
After marathon arguments advanced by lawyers representing the PTI and the ECP for almost five hours, the bench adjo­u­rned the hearing till Wednesday morning. 
During the hearing, Barrister Ali Zafar stated that the ECP, through the impugned order, had declared the PTI intra-party polls as void and deprived it of its election symbol ‘bat’. 
He argued that the ECP had no jurisdiction to decide whether the intra-party elections, held on its direction on Dec 2, were according to the party’s constitution or not. He argued that the ECP was like a ‘record-keeper’ and had no power to declare intra-party polls void.
Barrister Zafar contended that the only objection raised by the ECP against the intra-party polls was that the appointment of the party’s chief election commissioner was not in accordance with the mechanism provided in the party’s constitution.
He argued that as per Section 208 (5)of the Elections Act, 2017 if a political party failed to conduct intra-party polls within the given timeframe in their constitution, a show-cause notice should be issued, and if the party fails to comply with the directions of the ECP, then the commission should impose a fine which may extend to Rs200,000 but not less than Rs100,000. He argued that in no case the ECP could declare the intra-party elections of a political party illegal.
Barrister Zafar claimed that none of the petitioners before the ECP, who had challenged the intra-party polls, were members of the PTI and added that they had no legal position to challenge the party’s polls. “By stripping the party of its election symbol the ECP tried to oust it from the election fray,” he argued.
When the bench questioned why he had been insisting on getting ‘bat’ as its election symbol, he replied that the PTI had contested previous polls under the same symbol and masses were attached to it.
PTI Barrister Gohar Ali also requested the bench to decide the matter on Tuesday as the returning officers would allot symbols on Jan 13.
Intra-party polls ‘pre-decided’
ECP’s counsel Sikander Bashir Mohmand argued that the commission was a constitutional body which had been deriving its powers from different constitutional provisions.
He argued that the petition was not maintainable before the high court as this court could not issue an order affecting the entire country.
He argued that everything was pre-decided in the intra-party polls of the party and no one was allowed to take part in it except those who were elected unopposed.
Dispelling the impression that the ECP had targeted only a single party, he that cases of 19 political parties regarding their intra-party polls had still been pending before the commission.
He also pointed out that the plea of the PTI was also pending before the Supreme Court and the same could not be adjudicated simultaneously before the high court.
“The commission has given several relaxations to the petitioners to hold proper intra-party polls and has lastly on Nov 23 given them 20-day time for that purpose,” Mr Sikander pointed out adding that the PTI failed to do so.
He stated that the ECP role was not of a ‘record-keeper’ as the petitioner had said, but had wide powers under the Co­n­stitution as well as the Elections Act.
It may be noted that PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali and six other leaders had filed a joint petition requesting the court to declare the Dec 22 verdict of the ECP as illegal and without jurisdiction.
The case has seen several twists since Dec 22. A single-member bench of Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel had granted interim relief to the PTI and suspended the ECP’s impugned order. However, that relief proved short-lived as another single-member bench of Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan had vacated the said stay order over the review plea of the commission on Jan 3.

4,Only fraction of production orders for missing persons implemented,"Commission’s report to SC reveals highest number of disappearances reported from KP, then Balochistan.","• Commission’s report to SC reveals highest number of disappearances reported from KP, then Balochistan
• Claims some missing persons may have been killed in drone attacks, migrated without informing families
ISLAMABAD: Only seven per cent of the production orders for missing people issued by the Co­mmission of Inquiry on Enfor­ced Disappearances have been implemented, a report submitted by the body to the Supreme Court revealed on Tuesday, even though the commission consumes at least Rs2.2 million in monthly salaries alone.
The commission’s report came in response to Jan 3 directions by the top court in which a three-judge bench — consisting of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali — decided to ascertain facts from the commission.
The judges were hearing the case on enforced disappearances on a petition filed by Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan.
 
 

The report said that the Com­m­i­ssion of Inquiry on Enforced Dis­appearances has issued 744 production orders, of which 52 have been implemented by the add­resses. The remaining 692 production orders were yet to be executed by the quarters concerned.
The province-wise details of the cases in which the production orders were issued but not implemented indicate that 503 (73 per cent) out of 692 cases pertains to the Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, “which obviously appeared to be due to decade-long insurgency and war-like situation in the province, coupled with deaths of unknown people in drone attacks and migration to other countries without informing their families”.
The commission also received 182 petitions from the quarter’s concerned request for review of the production orders in these cases.
Earlier, the Supreme Court ordered the commission to collate and submit the names with parentage and addresses of those who went missing, the name and relationship of the person who reported the missing person, the date they went missing, [and] those who were in government in the federation and the concerned province at that time.
 
 

It also directed the commission to report whether the missing person was recovered or not, and if not recovered, detail the measures, if any, taken to find out the whereabouts of the missing person.
“In addition, all those in respect of whom production orders were issued but were not produced, and what was the follow-up by the Commission when its production orders were not complied with,” the court order said.
The commission’s report also disclosed that it has a disposal rate of over 77pc, with 7,781 of the 10,078 missing persons’ cases disposed of.
The commission’s report said that 1,365 out of 1,625 cases have been disposed of from Punjab, whereas 1,624 out of 1,787 cases have been disposed of from Sindh.
Similarly, 2,149 of 3,485 cases have been disposed of in KP, 2,284 out of 2,752 in Balochistan, 306 out of 361 in Islamabad, and 53 cases out of 68 have been disposed of in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
‘Chairman not withdrawing salary’
The report shows that the four members of the Commission of Enquiry on Enforced Disappe­arances have been allocated salaries of over Rs2.9m per month.
However, the Supreme Court was also informed that Javed Iqbal, the commission’s chairman, did not receive his monthly salary of Rs674,000 for five years, as he was also consecutively serving as the head of the National Accountability Bureau thus saving the national exchequer Rs50m.
The other three members of the commission are former judges Justice Zia Pervaiz and Justice Amanullah Khan, and former IGP Muhammad Sharif Virk, who have been drawing monthly salaries of Rs829,000, Rs1.14m and Rs263,326, respectively.
Mr Iqbal was appointed to the commission in September 2011, Mr Pervaiz in July 2021, Mr Khan in December 2023, and Mr Virk in March 2011.
