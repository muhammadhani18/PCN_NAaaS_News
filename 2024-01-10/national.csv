1,"Fawad, Murad Saeed’s nomination papers rejected by tribunals","Appeals against Shehbaz, Nawaz rejected in Lahore, Abbottabad; verdict reserved on Imran's appeal for NA-122.","• Appeals against Shehbaz, Nawaz rejected in Lahore, Abbottabad
• Verdict reserved on Imran’s appeal for NA-122 seat         
RAWALPINDI/LAHORE: In a series of rulings by various election appellate tribunals across the country, several politicians faced rejections regarding their eligibility to contest in the upcoming general elections, including former federal ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Murad Saeed.
On the other hand, tribunals in Lahore and Abbottabad set aside objections to the acceptance of nomination papers of the Sharif brothers in NA-132 and NA-15 constituencies.
The election tribunal in Rawalpindi, hearing Mr Chaudhry’s case, rejected his nomination papers on the charge of concealing facts from the returning officer.
The tribunal judge, Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz of the Lahore High Court, was hearing 
Mr Chaudhry’s appeal against the rejection of his nomination papers to contest the upcoming elections from Jhelum’s NA-60 and NA-61 constituencies.
The former PTI leader was accused of concealing bank accounts of his spouse and foreign trips in the affidavit submitted along with his nomination papers.
Verdict reserved on Imran’s appeal
Meanwhile, another appellate tribunal in Lahore reserved its verdict on Tuesday on an appeal of former prime minister Imran Khan, who had challenged the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-122.
Mr Khan’s counsel, Advocate Uzair Bhandari, said in his concluding arguments that the conviction of the PTI founding chairman in the Toshakhana case was not a hurdle in his way of contesting the upcoming general elections.
He said the Election Commission of Pakistan was not a court and its conviction in the Toshakhana case did not amount to disqualification under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.
Besides, the former premier’s sentence had already been suspended by the Islamabad High Court, the lawyer said.
Tribunal judge Justice Tariq Nadeem observed that there was a difference between the acquittal and suspension of sentence.
Appeal against Shehbaz rejected
On Tuesday, another election tribunal dismissed an appeal against the acceptance of nomination papers of former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif from NA-132.
The appellant, Shahid Orakzai, assailed the candidature of Mr Shehbaz on the basis of his alleged involvement in the 1997 attack on the Supreme Court.
He submitted that the Islamabad police, in its inquiry submitted to the Supreme Court, had identified then-chief minister Shehbaz and then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif as two top powerful people involved in the attack.
Mr Orakzai said the tribunal was empowered to verify the facts from the inquiry report in possession of the Supreme Court’s registrar.
He asked the tribunal to set aside the decision of the returning officer and reject Shehbaz Sharif’s nomination papers from NA-132. However, the tribunal dismissed the appeal and upheld the RO’s decision.
Another tribunal also dismissed an appeal against the acceptance of PML-N leader Abid Sher Ali’s nomination papers from NA-102, Faisalabad.
Another tribunal on Tuesday reserved verdict on appeals by PTI President Parvez Elahi, his wife, Qaisera Elahi, and son, Moonis Elahi, against the rejection of their nomination papers from NA-64, NA-69, PP-32 and PP-34 of Gujrat.
Another tribunal set aside a decision of the returning officer of NA-71, Sialkot, and accepted the nomination papers of Rehana Dar, mother of PTI’s former leader Usman Dar.
PTI objections on Nawaz set aside
In Abbottabad, an election appellate tribunal on Tuesday set aside PTI’s objections raised on PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s eligibility to contest the Feb 8 elections from NA-15.
PTI leader Senator Azam Khan Swati had last month challenged Nawaz’s eligibility to contest the upcoming general elections from the constituency — also called Mansehra-II — under section 62(1f) of the Constitution.
The tribunal judge, Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel, cleared the PML-N supreme leader for elections after hearing arguments of Senator Swati’s counsel, Sardar Basharat, and Nawaz Sharif’s counsel, Jehangir Jadoon.
Similarly, an appellate tribunal in Hazara on Monday dismissed the objection against the acceptance of the nomination papers of former provincial minister and PTI leader Yousuf Ayub Khan.
Yousuf Ayub Khan, the first cousin of PTI’s general secretary Omar Ayub Khan, was contesting from Haripur’s NA-18 and PK-46 seats.
Murad Saeed’s appeals rejected
In Swat, an appellate tribunal in Mingora on Tuesday dismissed both the appeals of the PTI leader Murad Saeed and issued an order to uphold the decision of the returning officers.
The returning officers had rejected Mr Saeed’s nomination papers for NA-3 and NA-4 as he was on the absconders’ list.
On Monday, the tribunal judge, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar, told Mr Saeed’s lawyers to ask the PTI leader to appear in person, but he failed to appear on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the election tribunal approved the nomination papers of PTI’s former provincial minister, Shakeel Ahmed, from Malakand and allowed him to contest the elections. 
Nisar Ahmed Khan in Mansehra, Muhammad Sadaqat in Haripur, and Fazal Khaliq in Swat also contributed to this report

2,SJC proceedings against Justice Naqvi ‘not stayed’,Justice Ahsan describes proceedings against SC judge as ‘contrary to established norms’,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Cou­rt on Wednesday rejected a request to stay Jan 11 Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) proceedings against Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, as an SJC member Justice Ijazul Ahsan described the council’s proceedings against his colleague “contrary to the established norms”.
A three-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mando­khail and Justice Musarrat Hilali asked the petitioner judge to amend his petitions by incorporating the complainants before the SJC as respondents.
When senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan repeatedly requested the bench to at least stay the SJC proceedings, as was done in the cases of Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Khan observed that the present proceedings were preliminary in nature.
The three-judge bench had taken up a set of petitions challenging the issuance of a show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi, who was facing complaints of misconduct before the SJC. The SJC, which is seized with a set of 10 different complaints against the judge, will resume its proceedings in the open court on Jan 11 (Thursday).
The court was hearing arguments for the last two days on a point that should the court allow the informer, who filed complaints before the SJC, to become a necessary party in the pe­­­titions, moved by the judge. “It is ne­­cessary to hear the other side so that nobody should be left unheard and that justice should also be seen to be done,” Justice Mandokhail observed. 

Justice Ahsan describes proceedings against SC judge as ‘contrary to established norms’

Justice Mandokhail observed that the complaints before the SJC should be comprehensive so that no judge against whom the complaint had been filed could go scot-free. He added that the complainants should be punished in case allegations turned out to be baseless.
Makhdoom Ali Khan, however, ar­­gued that the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) has no right to punish anybody since proceedings under this provision were not adversarial.
He argued the informers have no right to expect their complaints shou­­ld always be inquired upon by SJC and if every complainant has to be he­­a­rd then this tendency would expose the judges and the judiciary since whenever denied the right or in case of any adverse order by the cou­rt, the aggrieved complainant will knock the doors of the Supreme Court.
The counsel also cited the recent meeting of SJC in which it decided to reject 19 different complaints against different judges without hearing the complaints.
Citing the cases of Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, the counsel contended that the courts had held while deciding these matters that Article 209 under which proceedings against the judges were initiated on misconduct, was more concerned with the protection of judges than prosecuting them.
In his petition, Justice Naqvi had described the allegations levelled in the show-cause notice as false, baseless and not supported by evidence.
‘Hasty’ proceedings
On the other hand, Justice Ijazul Ahsan — part of the five-member council — who had refused to join other members of the council on Nov 22, 2023, in the issuance of the show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi, regretted the hasty proceedings.
In his letter to the SJC members, Justice Ahsan regretted that debate and discussion have been non-existent and have not been permitted during the ongoing council proceedings. “Thus Nov 22, 2023 proceedings when the second show-cause notice was issued against Justice Naqvi were completely devoid of any discussion or deliberation whatsoever,” he said.
This manner of proceedings has cast an unwelcome doubt over the whole process, therefore he disagreed with the process followed and the manner in which the proceedings were being conducted, Justice Ahsan explained.
Referring to the allegations in the complaint against the judge, the letter regretted these were utterly without merit or substance, both in law and even on a prima facie appraisal of the facts.
“Of these, allegations a few relate to the properties or transactions of properties of the sons of the respondent ju­­d­­­ge when the sons were lawyers in pr­­a­­ctice and persons of independent me­­ans.” The sons are effectively being condemned unheard, the letter regretted.
The thrust of the allegations is that the properties have been transacted at values supposedly far below their market value but not a shred of any credible evidence has been produced by the complainants in this regard.
“If the judge had been given an opportunity as suggested and the properties mentioned found to be declared in his tax returns, the matter of whether there had been any undervaluation as alleged would then be for the tax authorities to determine under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001,” the letter said.
The letter regretted that a reasoned and deliberative approach ought to have been adopted which would have prevented the council from falling into the error that has now been committed with the issuance of the show-cause notice.

3,Assembly session on GB protests sought,Protests aga­inst the increase in subsidised wheat rates enter their 14th day.,"GILGIT: Protests aga­inst the increase in subsidised wheat rates entered their 14th day on Tuesday, with scores of people blocking main roads in the region despite freezing temperatures.
Meanwhile, opposition members in the GB Assembly have submitted a requisition for a session to discuss the region’s financial and wheat crises.
The Awami Action Committee, an alliance of various political and religious parties in the region, gave the call for protests against the decision to increase the subsidised wheat rate from Rs20 to Rs36 per kilogram and other issues.
Demonstrations were recorded in all ten districts of GB, with protesters vowing to continue sit-ins till the acceptance of their demands.
In the Khomar area of Gilgit, local women bloc­ked Shahrah-i-Quaid-i-Azam to protest against flour sho­­rtage.
They accused the food department of decr­e­asing the subsidised wheat quota for households.
One protester alleged that only 20kg of flour was being provided per family, which was not enough for even a month.
She said it was a “double injustice” to cut the flour quota and increase the subsidised wheat rate.
A demonstration was also organised in the Jutial area of Gilgit, with protesters blocking a road and chanting slogans against the government.
GB assembly session
In the GB Assembly, Opposition Leader Kazim Mesum and other members submitted a requisition for convening a session to discuss the financial crisis and subsidised wheat rate hike.
The requisition, signed by 10 opposition parties’ members, requested the GB Assembly speaker to con­­vene the session on Jan 11.

4,Group of PTI KP leaders protests ‘sale of tickets’,"PK-55 candidate calls intra-party elections “flawed”; claims tickers given on directives of Aleem Khan, Pervaiz Khattak.","ISLAMABAD:  Around a dozen PTI workers held a protest in the federal capital on  Tuesday against what they called “the sale of party’s tickets” in Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa.
The workers, who reached Islamabad from KP, held a protest outside PTI’s office in G8, claiming that the party has been “hijacked by some elements close to the establishment, former chief minister Pervaiz Khattak and Aleem Khan”.
While speaking to the media, Saud Shah Roghani, who submitted his nomination papers from the PK-55 constituency of KP Assembly, said the party has been “hijacked by leaders close to the establishment”.
He also announced plans to launch his own panel for the upcoming elections, claiming it would be  “the true representative of Imran Khan”.
“Imran Khan said ‘absolutely not’ to the US. Now a decision has been made to punish him for that statement, and his friends are being used to weaken him and his party so he would be left with no choice but to surrender,” Mr Roghani claimed.
Mr Roghani reiterated “his support for Mr Khan for change” and vowed to continue supporting his leader.
He claimed to be “representing 500 candidates from across the country” and said he would distribute tickets among them.
He also threatened to launch his own panel for the general elections and give tickets to party loyalists.
“Currently,  a four-member committee has been established for the distribution of tickets [in KP], and tickets are being sold,” he alleged, citing Rs40 million as the price for one ticket.
 
 

Mr Roghani called PTI’s intra-party elections “flawed”, adding that PTI KP and other office bearers elected after the exercise “had no value”.
Those leaders who  had been “watching their own interests for the last 10 years” have been  “selected” as a result of the flawed elections.
He claimed the establishment was arresting party workers and trying to fill PTI’s ranks with their loyalists.
“Establishment has been trying to weaken the party. Currently, tickets are being given on the directions of Aleem Khan and Pervaiz Khattak,” alleged Mr  Roghani.
“Imran Khan always stood for merit, but at the moment,  tickets are being given only to corrupt people. Imran Khan is in jail  and does not know what is happening with the party.”
He added that even though he submitted nomination papers for the national and provincial assembly, he will withdraw them.
Mr  Roghani said that in the absence of intra-party elections, he had an equal  status in the party as the incumbent chairman, Barrister Gohar.

5,National Institute of Health issues travel advisory as influenza cases surge,Advisory also talks about influenza-like illness (ILI) and respiratory syncytial virus which are caused by influenza.,"ISLAMABAD: While mercury has fallen across the country, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has issued a travel advisory for the prevention of influenza and other respiratory infections.
The advisory also talks about influenza-like illness (ILI) and respiratory syncytial virus which are caused by influenza.
“Flu viruses are continuously changing/mutating with a likelihood of emergence of new flu viruses every year. This makes influenza a difficult disease to control with varying extent of spread, timing, severity, and length of the season. However, an upsurge of cases in Pakistan is usually been observed in winter season. The flu cases increase as temperature falls during December to February,” it stated.
“The ILI cases are observed to be higher in Islamabad specifically due to various reasons ranging from weather instability (dry cold) which causes low precipitation and increased tourism to northern and from northern areas via Islamabad despite satisfactory surveillance of influenza,” it stated.
The objective of the advisory is to alert and sensitise all travellers regarding the ILI situation in country, especially Islamabad.
Also, to alert and sensitise points of entry and healthcare workers to be vigilant in the detection of any suspected case who is travelling to and from any area where the ILI cases have been reported and to strengthen and improve the level of preparedness for prevention, control and management of influenza-like illness.
Influenza is easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing and its symptoms include the abrupt onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue.

6,Clash of narratives at Islamabad’s National Press Club as parallel camps set up,Baloch­is­tan Shuhada Forum seeks judicial probe into killings by banned outfits; Dr Mahrang set to call for another strike.,"• BSF speakers seek judicial probe into killings by banned outfits in Balochistan
• Dr Mahrang set to call for another nationwide strike
ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Press Club (NPC) remains a focal point for the ongoing protests for the rights of Balochistan, with two separate camps witnessing a steady influx of visitors.
However, while the cro­wd at one of the camps, or­­ganised by the Baloch­is­tan Shuhada Forum (BSF), has decreased, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) camp sees a growing number of families joining in.
 
 

Abdullah Gul, the cha­i­r­man of Tehreek-i-Jawa­n­­an Pakistan/Kashmir, visited the BSF camp on Tu­­esday, led by former caretaker minister Nawabzada Jamal Raisani.
During his visit, Mr Gul highlighted the involvement of India’s foreign intelligence agency RAW in terror activities in Balochistan.
Mr Raisani, also conte­sting for a National Ass­e­m­­bly seat from Quetta, em­­phasised the need for the government to ackno­wledge and financially support victims of terrorism and targeted killings in Balochistan.
The government nee­d­­ed to listen to the voice of the martyrs of Baloch­is­tan, both the civilians and those belonging to law enforcement agencies and armed forces, he said and hinted at a conspiracy to create internal conflicts within Balochistan.
“The state should at le­­ast extend financial help to the victims of terrorism and target killings,” Mr Raisani told Dawn. “The missing person issue was a genuine problem of Bal­o­­­chistan, but we demand that they should condemn the terror acts by Balo­ch­istan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Libe­ration Force (BLF), Balo­­ch Republican Army (BRA), Majeed Brigade, etc.”
 
 

Mr Raisani’s father, Nawabzada Siraj Raisani, was assassinated in a 2018 suicide attack during the election campaign.
At the same time, speakers at the BSF camp called for a judicial commission to investigate the killings by banned outfits. They accused the rival BYC camp of being fraudulent and supporting anti-state elements.
The names of Baloch Na­­­­tional Army (BNA) com­­manders Gulzar Imam Shambe and Sarf­raz Ahmed Bungulzai, who earlier admitted to receiving funding from India, were also mentioned in the speeches.
BYC camp
On the other hand, the BYC camp, which has been established since Dec 22, continued to attract more participants despite harsh weather and pressure from law enforcement agencies.
 






The camp’s organisers, demanding information on missing persons, welcomed 12 new family members, mostly women, on Monday and Tuesday.
Dr Mahrang Baloch, a leader of BYC, told the media that her camp welcomed the BSF protesters and said they, too, were demanding the authorities to act and improve the law and order situation in Balochistan.
“This is what we have been demanding that the law and the system of the country should prevail in Balochistan, too,” she said.
“There has only been one accusation on us that we do not condemn violence by BLA. We have done it several times and say it here as well.”
 






Referring to the BSF camp, she said that those referring to the surrender of some people should understand that any news conference was not enough, and the surrendering people should have to be presented in a court of law.
Dr Mahrang, possibly encouraged by the response to previous strike calls, said the BYC would soon announce plans for a nationwide strike to demand transparency regarding the details of missing persons.

The demonstrators also called out the violence against the participants of Turbat long march in Islamabad.
The Panjgur protest rally was called by Baloch Yak­jehti Committee (BYC). The protesters included a good number of political workers, students, women and children.
 






The demonstrators gathered at Javed Shaheed Chowk and then marched on various roads of the town, chanting slogans against the government. They were also holding placards and banners inscribed with their demands.
The leaders of BYC, including Nazeer Dost, Adiba Baloch, the daughter of missing Zaheer Baloch, Bisma Baloch, Fahid Asif Baloch and Nadir Baloch, while speaking at the gathering, said the government was itself violating the relative article of the Constitution regarding human rights.
“The tactics used by the government can not suppress the voice of Baloch people since not only they’re struggling for their rights, but also saving the lives of their missing loved ones,” the speakers said.

9,ECP sends poll symbols of 145 parties to returning officers,Sources tell Dawn the list does not include PTI's ‘bat’; ANP also not allotted symbol due to legal deficiencies.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission Pakistan (ECP) has sent a list of electoral symbols of 145 political parties to the returning officers (ROs).
Sources told Dawn the list does not include ‘bat’ — PTI’s electoral symbol. Around a dozen other parties, including ANP, have also not been allotted symbols due to legal deficiencies.
 
 

PTI has been deprived of the symbol as ECP has declared its intra-party elections null and void, while the ANP failed to conduct the elections and thus became ineligible to obtain election symbols under the law.
Major parties, which have been allotted symbols, include PPPP (arrow), PML-N (tiger), PTI-Nazriyati (batsman), PTI-Parliamentarians (turban), Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (eagle),  MQM-P (kite), JUI-F (book), BNP-Mengal (axe), Jamaat-i-Islami (scale), Sunni Ittehad Council (horse), BAP (human eye), Pakistan Muslim League (tractor) and PkMAP Party (tree).
The list of contesting candidates will be published tomorrow (January 11), and returning officers are to allot symbols to the contesting candidates on Jan 13.
It has been highlighted that election symbols of political parties shall in no case be allotted to any independent candidate. The list of separate election symbols for independent candidates has also been sent to the ROs.
The Election Commission has directed the returning officers not to allot symbols other than those mentioned in the list.
