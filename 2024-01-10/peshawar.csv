PTI-P chairman Pervez Khattak presented the election manifesto during a news conference here saying after winning elections, his party will make “all-out efforts for justice, meritocracy and equal rights for all as well as development in all spheres of economy.”

Says its govt will ensure enrolment of all children in schools, provision of health card to all

Mr Khattak said his government would strive to create equal opportunities of development for all segments of society besides the security of life and property for the poorest and for those incapable of staying against the tyrants and oppressors.
“We believe that terrorism has devastating and far-reaching effects on the economy, psychology, mindset, happiness index, and life security in KP in particular and in Pakistan in general. Our commitment is to control all menaces and promote the level of tolerance and acceptance among all citizens of Pakistan,” he said reading from the manifesto.
The PTI-P leader said his party’s vision was peace and prosperity with good relations with neighbouring countries on the basis of mutual trust and reciprocity.
He also said his government would ensure that Pakistan has friendly relations with all sovereign countries of the world with those ties based on transparency, mutual interests, and sovereignty.
“Our vision is that no child should be out of school, so we [after coming to power] will introduce an Education Card for free education to every deserving student in colleges, and uniform standards for public and private schools. 
We will devise tools and strategies to bring concepts-based curriculum, give away stipend to secondary school girls, devise a comprehensive strategy to synchronise religious schools into the mainstream,” he said.
Mr Khattak said his government would introduce an independent and transparent mechanism to appoint university vice-chancellors, senior staff members and administrators.
He said when he was the chief minister of the province, the police department was reformed but still the people were not satisfied with the performance of the police.
“We will further those reforms,” he said, promising the launch of online FIRs as well as the registration of cases for all offences committed.
The PTI-P chairman said his government would have zero tolerance for all crimes from kidnapping to extortion to rape to robberies to drugs to land grabbing and the police’s performance would be regularly monitored at the highest level.
He said the PTI-P promised the provision of “Health Card” to all families, establishment of a tertiary care hospital at district level, and revitalisation of MTIs to turn them into more efficient and friendlier for visitors.
“The PTI-P government will strengthen DHQ hospitals and RHCs by providing them with the best possible equipment, doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff and eliminate quackery and unregistered practitioners and hospitals,” he said.
Mr Khattak said his party believed that the future isin modern agriculture techniques, so its government would provide a framework for land utilisation to irrigate the un-irrigated land through flood dams.
He also promised subsidies for modern technologies, including tunnel farming, cold storages, value chain for agricultural products, drip irrigation and pivot irrigation system.
The PTI-P chairman said his government would ensure e-governance in public administration through innovative systems and make all postings, transfers, payments, admission filing system and employments through e-system.
He said after coming to power, his party would bring the merged tribal districts on par with other parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through massive development and provision of basic services to the people.
“We will ensure protection of minorities against hate and violence, and protect their civil, social and religious rights as well as their places of worship, property and institutions as guaranteed by the Constitution,” he said.
Mr Khattak promised a business-friendly atmosphere across the province and said during his party’s rule, all relevant government departments would provide assistance to businesses and startups for growth.
“Our youth policy has three Es, including education, employment and engagement. It will ensure investment in educated, skilled young people to make Pakistan a great nation,” he said.
Mr Khattak said his party’s government would take “right steps and initiatives” to mitigate hardships of special persons and would provide them with a monthly stipend of Rs5,000-Rs10,000 depending on the level of disability.

“Owners of wagons and taxicabs plying inter-city and intra-city routes have increased fares on their own burdening travellers already hit by record inflation,” commuter Mohammad Arif Rajput told reporters here.
He said under the Natural Gas Load Management Plan, the federal government had suspended gas supply to filling stations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leading to their closure.
“Transporters have increased fares across Hazara Division without waiting for the regional transport authority’s notification,” he said.
Another commuter, Mohammad Ayub, complained that fares of the transport vehicles plying from Mansehra to Shinkiari, Jabori, Abbottabad, Oghi, Balakot, Darband and Haripur areas had also gone up considerably to the misery of travellers.
He said transporters didn’t reduce fares despite the reduction of petroleum prices last month but they were quick to increase them after the closure of CNG stations without the mandatory approval of the RTA or district administration.
The commuter said the government should identify transport vehicles using CNGs and petroleum to check unjustified fare hikes.
Another resident, Sadaqat Ali, demanded a crackdown on taxi drivers for increasing fares without the permission of authorities.

The demand was made during a gathering of members of Industrialists Association Peshawar (IAP) here on Tuesday. Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Fuad Ishaq was the chief guest, according to a statement issued here. 
Speaking on this occasion, Fuad Ishaq vowed to continue struggle for gaining constitutional rights on gas and electricity for KP industries.
The chamber chief said the government was least bothered to pay heed towards the demands of business community. “We had timely raised the matter of hike in power and gas tariff, but the centre didn’t pay heed,” he lamented.
Mr Ishaq said KP was a net exporter of gas as it produced 550MMCFD (million cubic feet per day), and was only consuming 200MMCFD, of which 35 MMCFD was being consumed by KP industries and 40MMCFD by CNG sector. Similarly, he said KP was producing 42 per cent of the country’s total oil.
He said the chamber had proposed to the federal government to rationalise income and sales tax to streamline the Afghan transit trade, but to no avail.
Likewise, the SCCI chief said mark-up rates had been increased to 24-25pc, which was extremely non-feasible for industries of KP.
Also, he told the participants that the chamber had raised an effective voice for obliging the US officials in Pakistan to provide funds and soft loans to KP youth through IDPP.
On this occasion, former SCCI president Senator Mohsin Aziz said KP was grappling with multiple issues, but the government had turned a blind eye to them. “Industries are being denied new gas connections, which is their right under Article 158 of the Constitution. Instead they are being forced to use the costly RLNG,” he deplored.
He asked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Economic Zones Development and Management Company (KPEZDMC) to play its role in facilitating the KP industrialists.
On the occasion, KPEZDMC chief executive officer Javed Khatak said it was working to expand economic zones across KP.
Former Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry president Ghazanfar Bilour said 40pc of industries in KP had closed down due to rising production costs.

Mr Fazalullah, who is a relative of PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam, announced his decision during a meeting held at his residence in Aloch, Puran here the other day.
Former tehsil nazim and expected candidate from PK-30, Mohammad Ali Khan and Raja Pervaiz Khan, a candidate for NA-11, also addressed the meeting and criticised the PML-N provincial leadership over the seat adjustment with JUI-F.
In his speech, Fazalullah claimed his father, former provincial minister late Pir Mohammad Khan was mentor of Amir Muqam, but he (Muqam) had forgotten his and his father’s sacrifices for the party by depriving him of the party ticket.
He said after consulting his supporters, family elders, he had decided to contest the elections independently.
He said his uncle, Raja Pervaiz Khan would contest NA-11, his other uncle, Raja Mohammad Ali Khan from PK-30, and he would himself vie for PK-29, his home constituency in Puran.
Under the seat adjustment, PML-N announced support for JUI-F candidate, Shaukat Ali in PK-29, and JUI-F supported PML-N in rest of the seats.
Meanwhile, at a jirga held in Chakesar tehsil, local elders announced to boycott the PML-N candidate from NA-11 in protest against what they said involvement of party’s provincial president Amir Muqam in making changes to constituencies. They claimed the final delimitation had divided Chakesar tehsil into three different constituencies.
When contacted, Mr Muqam argued that Mr Fazalullah’s decision to contest elections independently would not make any difference to the party in elections. He said Chakesar people would vote for PML-N candidates.
In a separate development, Pakistan Peoples Party Malakand division joint secretary Amir Sultan announced quitting the party, saying PPP did not fulfill its commitment made with him.
Mr Sultan, a leader of Gujjar tribe, made the decision through a social media post, which he also confirmed to Dawn. Mr Sultan had joined the PPP in September 2023 after quitting JUI-F.

Several rounds of negotiations took place among these mainstream parties lately but they all ended without breakthrough, according to sources.
They claimed that the JUI-F faced strong resistance from within over the proposed electoral alliance or seat adjustment with the ANP or QWP in PK-62 constituency.
The sources insisted that JUI-F nominee Maulana Kamal Shah, after getting a go-ahead from the party’s provincial leadership, had established his election office in the area.
In some constituencies, party activists have already announced they will contest election as independents. Two of them belong to the same constituency.
The sources said under those unfavourable circumstances, the party’s district leadership was reluctant to make an electoral alliance or seat adjustment with the ANP and QWP.
Meanwhile, the JUI-F’s office-bearers in various union councils of PK-64 on Tuesday demanded of the party’s central and provincial leadership to award PK-64 election ticket to Haji Ahmad Ali Jan and warn if that didn’t happen, they would support Mr Jan as an independent candidate.
During a joint news conference, they also insisted that the denial of the PK-64 ticket to Mr Jan would badly hit the party’s position in the NA-24 constituency.
Meanwhile, the Jamaat-i-Islami and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz are understood to be in contact with the Qaumi Watan Party for seat adjustment.
However, formal negotiations for cooperation in the Feb 8 elections have yet to take place.
Insiders claim that talks among three political parties, which would begin shortly, could lead to the formation of an electoral alliance.
