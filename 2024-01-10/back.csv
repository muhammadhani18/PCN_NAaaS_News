Following today’s deadline for filing appeals against the decisions of the returning officers, election tribunals across the country are hearing pleas against rejections.
The tribunal overturned the decision of the RO and gave the green light to Rashid to contest from the constituency against the PML-N supremo. 
Appeals of Azam Khan Niazi and PTI’s Mian Mehmoodur Rashid from Lahore were also accepted, hence clearing their path to contest in upcoming general polls.
In Islamabad, the election tribunal of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) approved the nomination papers of Nayab Ali, a transgender and human rights activist, and declared her eligible.

2,Bajwa offered two-thirds majority for ending protests in Aug 2022: Imran,"‘Better for us to face death than to accept slavery in free country’, sister Aleema quotes ex-PM as saying","Aleema Khan, the sister of former prime minister Imran Khan, revealed on Wednesday that her brother had received a message from the then Chief of Army Staff (COAS), General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa, offering a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly to PTI if Imran ended his protest that had commenced after his ouster from the Prime Minister’s Office.
Imran had launched a nationwide protest following his removal in April last year, becoming the only prime minister in the history of Pakistan to be removed via a no-trust vote.
Khan’s party, which governed the country for over three-and-a-half years, had been struggling to stay in power as its allies betrayed and joined hands with the then-opposition parties that had joined forces against the PTI government.
The former PTI chief had claimed that the conspiracy to topple his government was hatched in Pakistan, a contradiction from his earlier stance in which he blamed the United States for his ouster.
“Former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa conspired against an elected government in collaboration with the PDM [Pakistan Democratic Movement] parties when all economic indicators were showing positive trends,” he had said.
After a meeting with Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, Aleema Khan, while talking to the media, said, ""Imran Khan conveyed a message to me, stating, 'In August 2022, General Bajwa approached me with an offer that if PTI ceased protests against regime-change, a two-thirds majority for the party will be ensured in the National Assembly'"".
According to Aleema Khan, Imran Khan asserted, ""Our parents were born in a slave country; we are free, and I will not bow before anyone except God. It is better for us to face death than to accept slavery in a free country"".
Aleema Khan further highlighted the challenges faced, stating that every day permission is granted to only three to four journalists in jail.
“There is no open trial [happening in Adiala jail]. The cases against Imran have no weight,” she added.
She further said Imran is entangled in a new case whenever he gets bail in an old case, saying that it was a ploy to keep the former prime minister in prison.

3,IHC firmly denounces unlawful detentions,"Warns that one day officials of secret agencies, their bosses will be prosecuted","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has urged government authorities to have faith in the judicial system while warning that one day officials of secret agencies and their bosses will be prosecuted for enforced disappearances in the country.
""The prime minister and the interior and defense ministers will have to give an undertaking that forced disappearances will not happen again. You may not do it today, but at one point, even the highest authorities will be prosecuted,"" IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani said on Wednesday.
The judge was hearing a petition moved by the protestors who are staging a sit-in in Islamabad against enforced disappearances in Balochistan.
Justice Kayani said the state and its institutions do not believe in the rule of law. “The concept of missing persons is unique to our country; other countries do not have such a concept. Everyone is accountable before the law,"" he said.
He said there is no point in detaining a person for months, if the authorities cannot prove the accusations levelled against him. Agencies, he said, have previously detained many individuals without finding anything against them, yet they were not released as no one wants to take responsibility.
“No individual within an agency holds the authority to make that decision. I believe the highest authorities are responsible for any such actions. The prime minister, defense minister, interior minister, and their secretaries will be accountable; those beneath them won't have any say,” he said.
The judge noted that terrorism would not stop by merely imprisoning people and that there needs to be a trial. There are anti-terrorism courts for holding trials of alleged terrorists. The judge asked why the trial of Baloch militants cannot take place in the ATCs.
“Activate the ATCs for combating terrorism in Balochistan. Trust the system; no one would ever want terrorists to be protected,"" he said.
During the proceedings, Attorney General for Pakistan Usman Awan stated that lawyer for the petitioners, Imaan Mazari, had provided a list of missing Baloch students.
“Nine missing Baloch students have been recovered, while 15 are still missing. All efforts are being made to recover the remaining missing Baloch students,"" he said.
The judge noted that no missing Baloch has appeared in the court after his recovery.
“I don't know if the recovered individuals are doing well or not. I'm unaware of the health conditions of those who have been recovered.”
The judge stated that authorities will have to inform the court whether a missing person has been found alive or deceased. The court later adjourned till February 13

4,"3,485 people went ‘missing’ from K-P","Body informs top court 1,336 cases in province remain unresolved"," 
The report prepared by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances on Tuesday revealed that most people in the country -- 3,485 – went “missing” from the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Around a week ago, the Supreme Court directed the body to submit within 10 days a comprehensive report detailing all its orders issued to law enforcement agencies (LEAs) for the production of missing persons.
In line with the top court’s orders, the body handed over its report to the attorney general for Pakistan. “The province-wise details of the cases in which production orders were issued but not implemented, indicate that 503 (72.68%) out of 692 such cases pertain to the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, which obviously appears to be due to decade long insurgency and warlike situation in the province, coupled with deaths of unknown persons in drone attacks,” the report read.

6,Being punished for upholding law: Imran,"Imran Khan remain behind bars since August 5th, 2023 in Toshakhana case","Imran Khan, the former prime minister and PTI founder currently detained at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, claimed that he is being penalized for holding the powerful accountable under the rule of law.
""In a society that claims to follow Islamic principles, is 'Amr Bil Maroof' upheld?"" Imran queried during an informal interaction with journalists inside a courtroom at Adiala Jail after a hearing related to the Toshakhana case. 'Amr Bil Maroof' is a Quranic directive that translates to ""enjoining the good.""
Addressing the specifics of the case, he countered the National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) assertion that he utilized his office boy as a front-man for engaging in corruption valued at billions of rupees. ""Can a prime minister feasibly involve a peon in corrupt practices?"" he questioned.
Imran Khan emphasized that a society's vitality lies in its adherence to goodness. ""When goodness diminishes, so does the society,"" he affirmed.
The PTI founder refrained from commenting on the Supreme Court's January 8 decision that cleared the path for his arch-rival, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, to participate in the forthcoming elections.

7,Latif’s Imran bashing knows no end,Alleges Imran 'still enjoying support' shielding him from convictions,"PML-N leader Javed Latif on Tuesday called for more aggressive actions against former prime minister Imran Khan, demanding booking of him on several charges while also urging his conviction regarding the May 9 incident.
Addressing a news conference, the PML-N leader termed the Supreme Court’s decision of overturning lifetime disqualification a first step towards a level-playing field.
Latif, a minister without portfolio in the outgoing PDM government, asserted that Imran Khan still enjoyed support, shielding him from conviction in the May 9 incident. He called for intensified measures against the incarcerated former prime minister for threatening the judiciary, ECP, and state institutions.
Moreover, he regretted remarks given by the caretaker prime minister – who was single-handedly picked by his party – regarding the May 9 incidents.
He added that the premier’s uncertainty regarding Imran Khan's involvement in the riots was beyond comprehension, particularly given his time in power for several months.
He highlighted that the absence of any application from the ECP against Imran Khan served as proof of the latter's ongoing support.
Expressing regret, he noted the “lack of comprehensive media coverage” regarding Imran Khan's alleged threats to an ECP official while in jail.
He further accused the media of inadequately highlighting the significance of the cypher issue, asserting that Imran Khan's survival in that case was yet another instance of the support he enjoys.
He pointed out the presence of powerful figures exerting pressure on the judiciary to avoid convictions, questioning why there had been no conviction in the cypher case despite seven months having elapsed.
“Is it not a weakness of our institutions?”

The former federal minister asked whether Pakistan was a ‘slum’ with no rule of law where the former PTI chief rules as a gang leader operating with impunity, freely abusing and threatening individuals while expecting courts to comply with his whimsical demands.
He urged the judiciary to swiftly deliver a verdict on the May 9 incident.
Stressing a clear distinction between other political leaders and Imran Khan, he said that the latter was not a political figure but rather a thug.
He said it was being alleged that international forces conspired against Imran. “Why would they, what did he do for Pakistan?” he asked. “Why would international forces, that want to destabilise a Pakistan, conspire against a person, who did nothing for his country?”
Surprisingly, despite the recent series of reliefs granted to PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and his party, Javed Latif commented that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Nawaz Sharif's lifetime disqualification was merely an initial stride toward establishing a fair ground for competition.
He expressed that a truly level playing field would entail further decisions to rectify injustices previously imposed on them.
During his interaction with the media, a journalist later asked Javed about his definition of a level playing field and whether it meant arresting his adversaries and hanging them all.
However, in response, Javed dismissed both the question and the line of inquiry, reiterating his stance that if May 9 constituted a crime, the perpetrators ought to face appropriate punishment.
He also took jibe at Bilawal Bhutto stating that a person whose father does not take him seriously is not worth talking about.
Furthermore, he said that announcing ten points during a speech that revolved around giving handouts was not a manifesto.  “Such speeches are made by political leaders in every rally. A manifesto should mean a pragmatic road map for a political party to act on when in power.”
Javed said that he was against any seat adjustment in Punjab, as the first right to contest should be of those who have stood by the party in thick and thin.
He also announced that party leadership would be announcing its rally schedule in a day or two.
