0,New CDA regulations to protect investors in housing societies,"Owners will seek prior permission for handing over possession of plots, say officials","ISLAMABAD: The new regulations and policy related to housing societies of Islamabad, if properly implemented, could provide protections to citizens as now societies are bound to get allotment letters of plots vetted from the Capital Development Authority (CDA).
The CDA recently started implementing the said regulations, which were notified some months ago, sources said.
The new regulations will be helpful to bar housing societies from doing fraud with the citizens in shape of over-invoicing and making allotment of plots without having land.
Like other parts of the country, in Islamabad too, a large number of citizens had fallen prey to housing schemes as they were not provided plots despite paying their costs.

Owners will seek prior permission for handing over possession of plots, say officials

Many housing schemes had also sold out amenities land, which was originally reserved for green areas, mosques and school.
It is relevant to note here that last month Chairman NAB retired Lt Gen Nazir Ahmad had announced a new policy for housing schemes to check fraud.
Addressing a ceremony in connection with Anti-Corruption Day in Lahore, he had said that seven out of 10 people in housing schemes had fallen victim to fraud, and a new policy was being introduced to protect urban residents from housing scheme frauds in Punjab.
Following the NAB chairman’s statement, Dawn checked from CDA about its housing policy and officials said last year they had formulated new stringent regulations, which were in place now. They said that the owner of a housing scheme will seek prior permission from the CDA for handing over possession of plots by submitting an undertaking to complete the development works in accordance with the schedule.
“The interest of general public and allottees will be secured and in case of default of sponsors the individual Allottees/Transferees of the scheme/project shall be extended the approval for the construction of their houses/buildings in accordance with the bye-laws of the authority and in accordance with the approved Layout Plan (LOP), even in case the approval of LOP has been cancelled from housing scheme as the default of sponsor shall be recovered from the sponsor.”
The new regulations also stated that unless owners of projects of apartments and commercial units obtained approval from the CDA, the project shall not make public announcement and would not accept any advances from public.
“All allotment letters of housing projects issued by sponsors [owner of the project] shall be shared with CDA for regulating the saleable area within approved LOP and Building Plans,” read the new regulations. It further said that CDA would ensure that only those plots will be allowed to be allotted/transferred which are part of Approved LOP of schemes. “The plots, units, land, transferred to and mortgaged with the CDA, under the provisions of this regulation, shall not be allowed to be allotted/transferred, until redeemed by the CDA.”
The regulations further said that the owners of schemes will not start additional phase and or extension of the scheme/project without completing at least 70 per cent of existing one and he would not change the locations of already allotted plots. The sponsors of schemes/projects shall have a website as per approved format duly connected to CDA website containing details of land ownership approved layout plan of scheme project, NOC details etc.
It was also notified that minimum 8pc area (for Zone-2 & 5) and 12pc area (for Zone-4) shall be in the shape of regular parks/playgrounds. The provision of 8pc area in schemes planned in Zone-2 & 5 and 12pc in Zone-4 should include at least one multipurpose playground (measuring minimum 220’x 320’). The new policy also fixed the width of access road of schemes besides penalties and fines for violations.

Abdullah Mumtaz Kahloon had filed nomination papers to contest election from PP-76 Sargodha. He was allegedly picked up from the airport despite securing a protective bail from Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a case registered against him in Sargodha. 
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq took up the petition against his ‘arrest’ despite the court orders.
His counsel Babar Awan told the court that Kahloon had obtained protective bail and was scheduled to appear before the high court.
He said his client landed at the Islamabad airport where some unknown persons wearing tracksuits took him into custody from the immigration counter.
After hearing preliminary arguments, Justice Farooq adjourned further hearing for the same day and issued notice to the federation.
Later, Additional Attorney General Barrister Munawar Iqbal Duggal appeared before the court and said Kahloon had escaped from the immigration counter.
Justice Farooq remarked that a petitioner could not escape once the court had granted him bail. He pointed out that there was a system in place at every airport and it was not possible for an individual to dodge various checks. He directed the FIA to examine the CCTV footage and sought a report on Wednesday.

3,"Health minister terms hike in medical colleges fees ‘illegal’, promises reversal",Says he has directed the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council to revert the decision and issue letters to the colleges.,"ISLAMABAD: As private medical colleges have started charging their fees as per the revised structure, caretaker Health Minister Dr Nadeem Jan has said that the unprecedented increase in the fees is illegal and the ministry will ensure that the decision is reversed.
Speaking at a press conference along with caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi at the Press Information Department on Tuesday, the caretaker health minister recalled that during the first interaction with the media, he had mentioned that the fees charged by medical colleges were exorbitant. At the time, the caretaker minister had said that a committee was established to rationalise the fee structure.
“I got a recommendation from a committee about the maximum fees [for medical colleges] but I rejected these recommendations and directed it to reduce the fee. However, the colleges increased the fee unilaterally, which does not have any legal status. I have directed the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) to revert the decision and issue letters to the colleges,” the caretaker minister said.
According to the caretaker minister, the colleges increased the fee after the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC), which was abolished by the PML-N led coalition government, had allowed the colleges to increase the fees on their own.
“These colleges increased the fees by using an order of the defunct PMC. We are categorising the colleges and fees will be fixed as per the facilities available in the colleges,” he said, promising there would be a five per cent quota for unprivileged students as well.
It is worth mentioning that the committee established on the directions of the minister had suggested that the maximum fee should be Rs 1.9 million per annum but Dr Jan rejected the suggestion and sought further reduction in the fees. However, the colleges increased the fees above Rs1.9 million.
As per the documents available with Dawn, the annual fee of Akhtar Saeed Medical and Dental College Lahore for MBBS was around Rs1.8 million but for the upcoming year starting next month, the college will charge over Rs2.6 million.
HBS Medical and Dental College Islamabad will charge over Rs2.2 million as compared to Rs1.55 million for the current year. Foundation University Medical College has announced fees of Rs1.6 million; last year, it charged Rs1.58 million from Pakistani students. CMH Lahore Medical and Dental College and Institute of Dentistry Lahore (MBBS) have announced to charge Rs2.2 million as compared to Rs1.75 million for the current year.
Shalamar Medical and Dental College will charge Rs2.1 million compared to Rs1.65 million for the current year. Islamabad Medical and Dental College has been charging Rs1.6 million for the current year’s MBBS programme but it will charge Rs2.1 million for the next year.
Shifa College of Medicine Islamabad has increased its fees from Rs1.4 million to Rs1.7 million for MBBS. The Aga Khan University Karachi is charging Rs2.6 million for the current year but has announced annual fees of over Rs3 million for the upcoming year for its MBBS programme. Fazaia Medical College, Islamabad has increased fees from about Rs1.4 million to Rs1.6 million while Rehman Medical College Peshawar has increased fees from Rs1.5 million to Rs1.7 million.
Global Health Security Conference
Meanwhile, caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi said that Pakistan was going to organise the Global Health Security Conference (GHSC) on Wednesday (today). “The conference will be regarding global health which has nothing to do with politics. There are so many discrepancies in Pakistan’s health plan. We want to ensure that every person should have the facility of ambulance and treatment. During Covid-19 rich countries had access to vaccines but poor countries suffered. We want to upgrade the technology of vaccine equity.”
Dr Jan said the health ministry would play its role to increase vaccine production within the country.

Hafiz Ammar Yasir’s appeal was dismissed by the appellate tribunal of the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench on Tuesday while the appeals of Parvez Elahi and his wife, Qaisra Elahi, were dismissed on Monday evening.
“We would file an appeal before the larger bench of the LHC as our appeals were rejected unfairly,” Advocate Sardar Abdul Raziq Khan, the counsel for Mr Elahi, his wife and Mr Yasir, told Dawn on Tuesday.
Mr Elahi, who won NA-59 in the last general elections, had submitted his nomination papers for the same constituency and also for PP-23 for the upcoming general elections. His wife had also filed nomination papers for both constituencies while Hafiz Ammar Yasir, who won PP-23 in last general elections, submitted his papers for the same constituency.

Counsel to approach larger bench of LHC for relief

The nomination papers of all three candidates had been rejected by the returning officers after objections were levelled against them.
According to the decisions of the returning officers, copies of which are available with Dawn, the nomination papers were rejected on various grounds.
In the case of Mr Elahi, as many as 19 objections were filed against his nomination papers by an objector named Feyaz Shabbir Abidi, who was represented by Advocate Malik Irfan before the returning officer.
 

Hafiz Ammar Yasir

Some of the objections filed against Mr Elahi included concealing shares in a flour mill located in Lahore, failing to provide information regarding jewellery items and weapons, not disclosing assets of his wife which she had mentioned in her nomination papers, filing unattested papers, failing to mention separate bank accounts for the two constituencies for his electioneering expenses and concealing a plot measuring 10 marlas in Phalia.
The appellate tribunal’s judge, Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz, upheld the decision of Returning Officer Bilal bin Abdul Aziz.
Mr Elahi’s lieutenant in Talagang, former provincial minister Hafiz Ammar Yasir, who had been declared a proclaimed offender, is still in Saudi Arabia and is facing many criminal cases.
Scores of objections were levelled against him as well, including concealment of assets, unattested nomination papers, forged affidavit, property tax defaulter and fugitive from law.
Objections were also raised against Parvez Elahi’s wife Qaisra, who was accused of concealing assets, failing to mention separate bank accounts for both constituencies and not disclosing the real value of her gold jewellery.
