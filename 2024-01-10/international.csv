0,Massive winter storm knocks out power in nine US states,"The hardest hit states are Georgia with over 65,000 power outages, Florida with over 62,000 outages and Alabama with over 58,000 outages.","NEW YORK: A massive winter storm moving across the eastern half of the US on Tuesday ahead of a forecast brutal freeze this weekend knocked out power to over 302,000 homes and businesses in nine states.
The hardest hit states so far were Georgia with over 65,000 power outages, Florida with over 62,000 outages and Alabama with over 58,000 outages, according to data from PowerOutage.us.
Southern Co operates the biggest power companies in Georgia and Alabama, while NextEra Energy is the biggest power provider in Florida.
Extreme weather is a reminder of the February freeze in 2021 that left millions in Texas and other US Central states without power, water and heat for days, and a winter storm in December 2022 — known as Elliott in the energy industry — which almost caused power and natural gas systems to collapse in parts of the eastern half of the country. The current storm is blanketing an area from Minnesota in the north to Alabama in the south and from Kansas in the west to North Carolina in the east, according to AccuWeather.com. It is moving toward the US East Coast and the Northeast.
The storm is coming ahead of what will likely be the most frigid weather in over a year since the December 2022 storm blanketed much of the eastern half of the country, according to data from financial firm LSEG.
LSEG projected that natural gas demand, used to heat about half the homes in the country, would reach a daily record of 169.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Monday, Jan 15. That is Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the record gas use, which includes exports, is expected even though many businesses and government offices will be closed for a long US holiday this weekend.

1,WB forecasts global growth to slow for third consecutive year,"WASHINGTON: The World Bank warned on Tuesday that global growth in 2024 is set to slow for a third year in a row,...","WASHINGTON: The World Bank warned on Tuesday that global growth in 2024 is set to slow for a third year in a row, prolonging poverty and debilitating debt levels in many developing countries.
Hamstrung by the Covid-19 pandemic, then the war in Ukraine and ensuing spikes in inflation and interest rates around the world, the first half of the 2020s now looks like it will be the worst half-decade performance in 30 years, it added.
Global GDP is likely to grow 2.4pc this year, the World Bank forecast in its latest Global Economic Prospects report. That compares to 2.6pc in 2023, 3.0pc in 2022 and 6.2pc in 2021 when there was a rebound as the pandemic ended.
That would make growth weaker in the 2020-2024 period than during the years surrounding the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, the late 1990s Asian financial crisis and downturns in the early 2000s, World Bank Deputy Chief Economist Ayhan Kose told reporters.
Excluding the pandemic contraction of 2020, growth this year is set to be the weakest since the global financial crisis of 2009, the development lender said.
It forecasts 2025 global growth slightly higher at 2.7pc, but this was marked down from a June forecast of 3.0pc due to anticipated slowdowns among advanced economies. The World Bank’s goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 now looks largely out of reach, with economic activity held back by geopolitical conflicts.
“Without a major course correction, the 2020s will go down as a decade of wasted opportunity,” World Bank Group Chief Economist Indermit Gill said in a statement.
“Near-term growth will remain weak, leaving many developing countries especially the poorest stuck in a trap, with paralysing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people,” Gill added.
US spending strong
This year’s lackluster outlook comes after 2023 global growth came in an estimated 0.5 percentage point higher than forecast in June as the US economy outperformed due to strong consumer spending.
The US economy grew 2.5pc in 2023, 1.4 percentage points higher than its June estimate, the World Bank said. It forecast growth this year to slow to 1.6pc as restrictive monetary policy restrains activity amid diminished savings but said this was twice the June estimate.
The eurozone’s picture is considerably bleaker, with growth this year forecast at 0.7pc after high energy prices resulted in just 0.4pc growth in 2023. Tighter credit conditions prompted a 0.6 percentage point cut to the region’s 2024 outlook from the bank’s June forecast.
China weakens further
China also is weighing on the global outlook as its growth slows to a forecast 4.5pc in 2024. That marks its slowest expansion in over three decades outside of the pandemic-affected years of 2020 and 2022.
The forecast was cut 0.1 percentage point from June, reflecting weaker consumer spending amid continued property sector turmoil, with 2025 growth seen slowing further to 4.3pc.
“More generally though, weaker growth in China reflects the economy returning to a path of weakening potential growth due to an aging and shrinking population, rising indebtedness that constrains investment and in a sense, narrowing opportunities for productivity to catch up,” Kose told reporters.
Emerging market and developing economies as a group are forecast to grow 3.9pc this year, down from 4.0pc in 2023 and a full percentage point below their average in the 2010s.

2,US plan to place first lander on Moon in five decades fails,"WASHINGTON: A historic commercial US mission to the Moon failed after suffering a critical loss of fuel, organisers...","WASHINGTON: A historic commercial US mission to the Moon failed after suffering a critical loss of fuel, organisers admitted on Tuesday, ending for the time being America’s hopes of placing its first spacecraft on the lunar surface since the Apollo era.
Fixed to the top of United Launch Alliance’s new Vulcan rocket, Astrobotic’s Peregrine Lunar Lander blasted off on Monday from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, then successfully separated from its launch vehicle.
But a few hours later, Astrobotic began reporting malfunctions, starting with an inability to orient Peregrine’s solar panel towards the Sun and keep its battery topped up, owing to a propulsion glitch that also damaged the spacecraft’s exterior. The company said it had “no chance of soft landing” on the Moon.
NASA had paid the company more than $100 million to ship scientific hardware to a mid-latitude region of the Moon to answer questions about the surface composition and radiation in the surrounding environment, as it prepares to send astronauts back to Earth’s nearest neighbor later this decade.
Man on Moon plan pushed back
The United States has pushed back its planned return of astronauts to the Moon’s surface from 2025 to 2026, Nasa administrator Bill Nelson said on Tuesday.
Its first mission, an uncrewed test flight to the Moon and back called Artemis 1, took place in 2022, after several postponements. Artemis 2, involving a crew that doesn’t land on the surface, has been postponed from later this year to September next year.
Artemis 3, in which the first woman and first person of colour are to set foot on lunar soil at the Moon’s south pole, should now take place in Sept 2026.

3,Ex-UK Post Office boss returns honour over convictions scandal,LONDON: The former boss of Britain’s Post Office said on Tuesday she will return a royal honour received from ...,"LONDON: The former boss of Britain’s Post Office said on Tuesday she will return a royal honour received from Queen Elizabeth II as public anger mounts over a miscarriage of justice scandal.
Ex-CEO Paula Vennells said she had  “listened” to the growing clamour to hand back the CBE (Commander of the British Empire) honour given to her in 2018 and decided to relinquish it.
A petition calling for her to be stripped of the CBE, handed out  “for services to the Post Office and to charity”, had garnered more than a million signatures by the start of this week.
It follows renewed focus on what has been described as Britain’s biggest ever miscarriage of justice, which saw hundreds of subpostmasters wrongly convicted of theft because of a glitch in accounting software. “I have listened and I confirm that I return my CBE with immediate effect,” Vennells said in a statement.
“I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system.” Lives were ruined by the false accusations that led to some Post Office branch managers being jailed, going bankrupt, losing their homes and their health.
Four people took their own lives and dozens of those since exonerated died without seeing their names cleared.

4,Meta toughens content curbs for teens,WASHINGTON: Meta on Tuesday said it was tightening up content restrictions for teens on Instagram and Facebook as it...,"WASHINGTON: Meta on Tuesday said it was tightening up content restrictions for teens on Instagram and Facebook as it faces increased scrutiny that its platforms are harmful for young people.
The changes come months after dozens of US states accused Meta of damaging the mental health of children and teens, and misleading users about the safety of its platforms.
In a blog post, the company run by Mark Zuckerberg said it will now  “restrict teens from seeing certain types of content across Facebook and Instagram even if it’s from friends or people they follow.” This type of content would include content that discusses suicide or self-harm, as well as nudity or mentions of restricted goods, the company added.
Restricted goods on Instagram include tobacco products and weapons as well as alcohol, contraception, cosmetic procedures and weight loss programmes, according to its website.
In addition, teens will now be defaulted into the most restricted settings on Instagram and Facebook, a policy that was in place for new users and that now will be expanded to existing users.

5,Taiwan island scarred by China war prepares for key vote,"KINMEN: Spikes jut from the beaches of Taiwan’s Kinmen island, military checkpoints serve as traffic roundabouts...","KINMEN: Spikes jut from the beaches of Taiwan’s Kinmen island, military checkpoints serve as traffic roundabouts and bunkers double up as tourist cafes — reminders everywhere of the conflict decades earlier with Chinese communist forces.
Kinmen, which lies 200 kilometres from Taiwan island but only seven kilometres from the Chinese mainland, was a battlefield frontline for the nationalists who fled to Taiwan in 1949, and the target of frequent bombardments up until 1979.
Now Kinmen residents are preparing to vote in a crucial presidential election on Saturday that is being watched closely from Beijing to Washington, and whose winner will set democratic Taiwan’s course over the next four years.
“Xiamen, Kinmen — their doors face each other,” said Lin Ma-teng from his courtyard home on Lieyu, Kinmen’s closest inhabited islet to China.
The southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen, which Lin refers to, is close enough to Kinmen to be clearly visible across the narrow strait. “Big guns, small guns, they shell at each other,” the 79-year-old former serviceman said. “Thankfully, Kuomintang held Kinmen,” he added, referring to the nationalists who today make up Taiwan’s oldest political party.
One-time opponents of the Chinese Communist Party, Kuomintang (KMT) has evolved into a political bloc that today sees the economic fortunes of modern Taiwan linked to a close relationship with Beijing.
China has long claimed Taiwan as part of its territory, with President Xi Jinping — who has never ruled out the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control — describing  “unification” as  “inevitable”.
‘Already independent’
For the majority of the island’s 23 million people accustomed to democratic life, joining authoritarian China is unthinkable. In Taiwan’s election, KMT candidate Hou Yu-ih is going up against Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has shaped its platform on sovereignty from China.
The previous vote in 2020 saw a historic landslide for the DPP’s Tsai Ing-wen, who enraged China with her stance that Taiwan is  “already independent”. Over Tsai’s eight-year tenure, Beijing refused to engage with her government, ramping up tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
Besides sending in unprecedented numbers of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan, Beijing also staged two massive war games in recent years — flying missiles to surrounding waters and simulating a blockade of the island. These actions have upped global worries of a conflict, even if it is  “unlikely in the near term”, Amanda Hsiao of the International Crisis Group said.
“The extent to which tensions will be kept under check in the next four years will depend on how the next president approaches defence reform, and manages relations with Beijing and Washington.” 
‘Future of democracy’
China’s bombardments of Kinmen only stopped in 1979 when the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing. This is a position maintained today even as Washington becomes Taipei’s most important ally and its key weapons provider.
Meanwhile, US-China relations have plummeted, with the two superpowers tussling over technology exports, spying concerns and human rights issues — but also on the status of Taiwan.

6,Former Bhutan PM wins elections overshadowed by economic strife,"THIMPHU: Former prime minister Tshering Tobgay’s party won Bhu­tan’s election on Tues­day, media reported,...","

THIMPHU: Former prime minister Tshering Tobgay’s party won Bhu­tan’s election on Tues­day, media reported, after polls dominated by economic threats challenging the Himalayan kingdom’s longstanding policy of prioritising  “Gross National Happ­iness” over growth.
Foremost in the minds of many who voted are the struggles facing the Buddhist-majority kingdom’s younger generation, with chronic youth unemployment and a brain drain.
Both parties in the election are committed to a constitutionally enshrined philosophy of a government that measures its success by the  “happiness and well-being of the people”.
Tobgay’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) won nearly two-thirds of seats in parliament, The Bhutanese newspaper reported, with the 58-year-old conservation advocate expected to become premier for the second time.
Tobgay’s PDP  “wins the 2024 National Assembly general elections with 30 seats” while the Bhutan Tendrel Party (BTP) took the remaining 17, the paper said, based on preliminary results from each constituency.
There was no immediate confirmation from the Election Commission, which is expected to release final results on Wednesday, according to an official timetable released ahead of the polls.
Some voters had to trek for days to cast their ballots in the landlocked mountain nation of about 800,000 people, similar in area to Switzerland.
“Job opportunities in Bhutan are scarce and the new government should focus on solving this, so young people don’t leave abroad for greener pastures,” said 22-year-old student Ugyen Tshering, after voting in the chilly mountain air in the capital Thimphu, with Buddhist prayer flags fluttering in the background.
Bhutan’s youth unemployment rate stands at 29 per cent, according to the World Bank, while economic growth has sputtered along at an average of 1.7pc over the past five years.

7,"Soldiers watched as Israeli settlers killed Palestinians, says Washington Post","Attackers, masked and armed, can be seen targeting the home of blacksmith Awad Mahmoud Odeh.","WASHINGTON: Videos and eyewitness accounts published in The Washington Post on Tuesday, show how Jewish settlers attacked the Palestinian village of Qusra, in Israeli-occupied West Bank, killing three people and forcing others to leave the village as Israeli soldiers watched silently.
The victims included 17-year-old Obada Saed Abu Srour, civil engineer Muath Raed Odeh, and 20-year-old Musab Abdel Halim Abu Rida.
These individuals lost their lives while attempting to protect their community from armed Israeli settlers who had been targeting Palestinian villages even before the Oct 7 Hamas raid.
In one of the videos, the attackers, masked and armed, can be seen targeting the home of blacksmith Awad Mahmoud Odeh, located close to the Esh Kodesh Israeli settlement.

Attackers, masked and armed, can be seen targeting the home of blacksmith Awad Mahmoud Odeh

Abu Srour was shot in the back, while attempting to escape the gunfire. Despite the obligation under international and Israeli law to protect all residents, including Palestinians, Israeli troops did not intervene forcefully.
The attackers, carrying pistols and an M16 rifle, clashed with residents, causing injuries and fatalities. Witnesses claim that Israeli soldiers, stationed at nearby military outposts, did not intervene, raising concerns about their adherence to military orders requiring the prevention of crimes.
The aftermath of the attack saw more than 800 Palestinians displaced from their West Bank homes in the following month, contributing to the escalation of violence between Isra­elis and Palestinians. The incident is currently under review by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), and police have initiated an active investigation.
The failure of Israeli authorities to respond effectively to the violence on Oct 11 has sparked criticism, with human rights lawyers pointing out a pattern of inaction in the face of settler attacks.
The evidence collected by The Washington Post raises questions about Israel’s commitment to protecting Palestinian residents in the West Bank, as the report pointed out.
Witnesses reported that the attackers intentionally collided with a car in the area and began shooting at it.
The assailants then proceeded to fire at several residents, prompting at least 12 Palestinians to flee north, seeking cover behind a large building away from the gunfire.
Local residents told investigators Israeli soldiers, stationed at two military outposts situated between the settlement and the village, did not intervene at all as the violence unfolded.
Visual evidence suggests that soldiers had clear views of the road where residents were fleeing and the building they sought refuge behind.
Despite the proximity of military forces to the attackers and the village, the invasion continued uninterrupted.
Eyewitnesses told journalists that the Israeli border police even cautioned residents not to attempt to stop the armed settlers. Only the police were allegedly authorised to confront the attackers, and since they did not, the villagers remained exposed to the violence with no protection from any side.
The incident reportedly unfolded over several hours, with the attackers leaving the village around 1.30pm after firing at residents.
The violence resumed later in the day when the settlers gathered outside Awad Odeh’s home, about half a mile from the initial attack. Israeli forces intervened only after violence subsided, ensuring that the attackers face no retaliation.
Prior knowledge
The report notes that the soldiers’ attitude “raises questions” about Israel’s willingness to protect Pale­stinians. “There’s evidence suggesting that the military had prior knowledge of the violence, yet failed to take timely action to prevent the tragic consequences,” the report added.
The incident is under review by the Israeli military and police, as human rights activists and UN officials demand accountability for the incident and the protection of Palestinian communities in the West Bank.
These quotes from the Washington Post report illustrate the attack was planned, how it unfolded, and how the Israeli soldiers allowed it to happen.
“To all the rats in the sewers of Qusra village, we are waiting for you and we will have no mercy. The day of revenge is coming,” threats sent via Facebook to residents of Qusra on Oct 9.
“He said he wanted to go and help. I told him there was no need… He said, ‘If I die, I die — I would be martyred.’”
Aya, mother of 17-year-old victim Obada Saed Abu Srour, recalls her conversation with her son on the fateful day.
“I saw on the [security] cameras there were settlers around our home destroying cars and shooting at windows,” said Awad Mahmoud Odeh, describing the attack on his home during the incident.
“As soon as we got 10 to 15 meters out of our home, they shot at my family and injured my daughter, and I got shot right after,” said Odeh, recounting his experience during the attack.
“It was like being in an action movie. I didn’t expect to come out alive.”
Explaining how they survived the attack, Odeh said: “We hid in the house, and they tried to get in, and they shot and swore at anyone they saw.”
Describing the moment when armed settlers attempted to break into his home, Odeh said: “I’ve never been in a position like this.
“There’s no doubt that [the Israeli army] should have stopped it. They should have detained [the settlers] until the police come and take them.”
Roni Pelli, a lawyer with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, expressed the view on the failure of Israeli forces to intervene. “There has been a serious problem of implementing the law… ’standing idly by,” Peli added.
“[The authorities] came to take the DVR to hide their atrocities. They had to hide it,” said Odeh on the removal of surveillance footage by Israeli authorities immediately after the attack.
“Authorities, in general, have received intelligence, including from security forces on the ground, regarding the identities of the people who committed that crime,” an anonymous Israeli official, addressing the intelligence and subsequent investigations.

8,Gaza aid access ‘shrinking’: WHO,"“We’re seeing the health system collapse at a very rapid pace,” says WHO emergency medical coordinator Sean Casey.","GENEVA: The World Health Organisation warned on Tuesday its ability to provide aid and support struggling hospitals in Gaza was “shr­inking”, despite international dem­ands for more aid to be allowed in.
WHO staff described desperate scenes of seriously injured patients, including young children, begging for food in hospitals — which have seen most of their health workers flee for their own safety.
“We’re seeing this humanitarian catastrophe unfold before our eyes,” Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical coordinator, told reporters in Geneva via videolink from the Gaza Strip.
“We’re seeing the health system collapse at a very rapid pace,” he warned.
The Israeli army has claimed the operation is entering a new phase, involving troop reductions and more targeted operations in the territory’s centre and south.
But Casey said that on the ground, he had “not seen the lowering of the intensification”.
“What we are still seeing […] is a huge number of casualties related to hostilities, so shrapnel injuries, gunshot wounds, crush injuries from buildings that collapse. That’s still happening every single day.”
‘Recipe for disaster’
The United Nations says the Israeli aggression had left around 85 per cent of Gaza’s population of 2.4 million and left civilians in the besieged Palestinian territory at risk of famine and disease.
A UN Security Council resolution last month demanded that more aid be let in but the WHO said its access had only got worse.
“We’ve seen the shrinking of humanitarian space,” Casey said.
Israel has implied the United Nations is largely to blame for the lack of aid reaching those in need in Gaza. But Casey insisted the WHO and other UN organisations were “constantly trying to reach the areas in greatest need”.
“Every day we line up our convoys, we wait for clearance (from the warring parties) and we don’t get it,” he said. “And then we come back and we do it again the next day.”
The WHO has been unable to reach northern Gaza for the past two weeks, and has been forced to cancel six planned missions there.
The organisation said that only 15 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are even partially functioning, most of them in the south. The agency has long described desperate scenes in the few barely functioning hospitals remaining in the north, facing severe shortages of food, clean water, medicines and fuel.
And it warned that the situation was increasingly dire in the middle and south of the densley populated territory.
“Hostilities and evacuation orders in neighbourhoods of the middle area and Khan Yunis… are affecting access to hospitals for patients and ambulances, and making it incredibly complex for WHO to reach those hospitals to provide supplies and fuel,” said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories.

9,Palestinian journalist ‘vows to keep reporting’ after loss of another son,"Global silence, lack of protection hurt ‘more than killing itself’, says Wael Dahdouh.","Wael Dahdouh, Al-Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief has faced a series of personal tragedies, each one hitting him hard. Almost half of his family has been lost to Israeli aggression, but he is determined to stand firm until he can.
Wael’s 27-year-old son, Hamza Dahdouh, became one of the latest Palestinian journalists to fall 
victim to an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, adding to the grief of the veteran reporter. Despite the heart-wrenching loss and the emotional scenes of mourning, Wael, a symbol of personal tragedy and unwavering determination for many in this war, pledged to continue his work.
During a televised address after his son’s funeral, he said that journalists in Gaza would persist in their work, undeterred by the challenging conditions they were forced to navigate.
“All the world needs to see what is happening here. Hamza was everything to me, the eldest boy, he was the soul of my soul… these are the tears of parting and loss, the tears of humanity,” he said. 

Global silence, lack of protection hurt ‘more than killing itself’, says Wael Dahdouh

“It is true that the pain of losing someone is very difficult and when it is about your eldest son after the death of the family, then it becomes even more difficult,” he told NBC News from Gaza later on Sunday as he comforted Hamza’s daughter, who kept weeping on his shoulder. 
Describing his son as ‘chivalrous’, ‘tender’ and ‘generous’, Mr Dahdouh vowed not to give up on reporting. 
“In the end, this does not change anything of reality, and will not change any of our decisions. We 
are going to proceed as long as we are alive and breathing. As long as we are able to do this duty and deliver this message,” he said.
A massacre 
“Journalists are facing a massacre, a bloodbath in Gaza,” Mr Dahdouh told NBC News. 
He further expressed that the global silence and absence of safeguarding for journalists operating in Gaza “hurts us more than the killing itself.”
“We are not a part in any conflict. We have a duty the world has promised to protect and we demand the entire world to guarantee the safety of the Palestinian journalists. We hope that Hamza’s killing is the last killing that happens,” he said. 
The journalist gained widespread recognition beyond the region when, in October, he discovered during a live broadcast that his wife, 15-year-old son, 7-year-old daughter, and grandson had lost their lives in an Israeli airstrike on Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. Astonishing many viewers, he returned to the airwaves the next day.
In December, Mr Dahdouh suffered injuries, and his cameraman lost his life in a drone strike while they were reporting on the aftermath of an airstrike on a school in southern Gaza. He has been the prominent face of his network’s continuous coverage of the war, earning a place in the hearts of viewers for his unwavering reporting despite the tragic loss of his family.
Since the start of the war, a minimum of 79 journalists have lost their lives — 72 were Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese, TIME Magazine reported. However, according to Al Jazeera and AFP figures, so far 109 journalists have been killed. This marks the deadliest period for media workers since the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) started recording journalist deaths in 1992.
Both the CPJ and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have expressed increasing concern that journalists are becoming deliberate targets for the Israeli military. United Nations (UN) has also expressed serious concerns over the rising count of journalists’ deaths in Gaza. Media workers across the globe have also condemned the brutal murders.
