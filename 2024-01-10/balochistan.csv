0,Forest fires ravage Kaghan Valley,"Blaze imperils rare bird species, wild animals, saplings and trees","The forests of Kaghan Forest Division are facing a severe threat as wildfires continue to wreak havoc, negatively impacting birds, wild animals, trees, and plants.
The resulting smoke has polluted the valley’s environment, posing a significant challenge for both the ecosystem and local communities.
Despite annual occurrences of forest fires, the forest department has struggled to implement effective measures to control and prevent these incidents, prompting calls from locals for urgent government intervention.
The irony is that on one hand, the forest department avoids issuing permits for the use of green trees for construction and dry windfalls, while on the other hand, no attention is being paid to the damage caused by the wildfire.
Every year, the recurring forest fires in the scenic Kaghan Valley not only harm the saplings but also lead to the extinction of the rare bird species in the region. Apart from causing damage to the forests and wildlife, these fires have also damaged several human settlements in the past.

The rising clouds of smoke from the fires have further degraded the air quality throughout the valley, with visible dust and smoke lingering in the atmosphere. Citizens have demanded the provincial government take notice of the fires that occur every year to protect the forests and wildlife.
Talking to The Express Tribune, the locals said the region witnesses mysterious fires annually, impacting the lush greenery that attracts both visitors and diverse bird species. Residents living in proximity to these forests often find their homes in the line of fire.
When contacted, Divisional Forest Officer Rizwan Shah said, the forest department was actively engaged in the firefighting efforts. “The department has mobilised staff and forest guards to control the fires,” he said.
The preservation of Kaghan Valley’s natural beauty requires a collaborative effort between the government, local communities, and environmental organisations. Only through a united front can the region hope to overcome the challenges posed by recurring wildfires and ensure a healthier and more sustainable future for Balakot’s ecological landscape.

7,Murree imposes strict construction ban,Restriction aims at safeguarding natural beauty of popular hill resort,"In a bid to safeguard the natural beauty and environment of Murree, the administration has imposed a ban on all types of construction activities in the popular hill station.
In this regard, strict orders have been issued to enforce the most stringent legal actions against builders violating the ban.
In compliance with these directives, daily operations targeting illegal constructions have been initiated in Murree, resulting in the sealing of numerous buildings and the demolishing of pillars and columns of the under-construction structures at various locations.
Further, immediate directives have also been issued to the traffic police to take swift action against vehicles transporting sand, gravel, cement, and construction materials.
Meanwhile, public circles have criticised these efforts, referring to them as a targeted operation.
On Tuesday, under the supervision of Additional Deputy Commissioner, Qasim Ijaz, the staff of Municipal Corporation conducted an operation against illegal constructions in various areas during which 30 buildings were sealed and significant portions of several structures were demolished.
Further, columns and the roof of a building near the residence of a prominent political figure at Kashmir Point, Bank Road area, were also demolished. The owner, purportedly having an approved site plan, alleged that the operation was illegal.

Similar operations were carried out on Dana Expressway, Bhurban Road, Bank Road, and View Forth Road, targeting areas where building by-laws were openly violated during construction.
The administration justified these operations based on the observed violations. However, those affected have accused the administration of conducting arbitrary actions.
