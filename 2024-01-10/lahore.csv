0,Matric students in Punjab to appear in eight papers instead of nine from 2025,Students will sit for the Islamic studies paper in the ninth grade and attempt Pakistan studies in the tenth.,"LAHORE: The Punjab Board Committee chairman has announced a significant change in the examination system for the ninth and 10th grades.
The move, aimed at streamlining the examination process, involves reducing one paper from the current format.
Traditionally, students in the ninth and 10th grades had to sit for separate papers for Islamic Studies and Pakistan Studies. However, under the new system, there will be a single paper of 100 marks for Islamic Studies in the ninth grade, and a single paper of 100 marks for Pakistan Studies in the 10th class.
The decision is set to be implemented from the ninth grade in 2025.
The Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) controller of examinations has already communicated the change to the Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board (PCTB). As a result, from next year onwards, the textbooks for Pakistan Studies and Islamic Studies will be revised and prepared in accordance with the new decision.
This move is expected to simplify the examination process and reduce the burden on students, thereby fostering a more conducive learning environment. It remains to be seen how this change will be received by students and educators alike.
According to a notification available with Dawn, the papers in the subjects of Islamiat (compulsory) and Pakistan Studies (compulsory) are conducted at secondary school certificate (SSC) level. The examination of these subjects carrying 100 marks each is conducted in two parts i.e. ninth and 10th and each part carries 50 marks.
It is pertinent to mention here that on the instructions received from the Punjab government, a subject of Tarjmatul Quranul Majeed has also been added to the scheme of studies and the paper of this subject was also taken by the board in SSC (ninth & 10th) first & second annual examinations, 2023. Now, a student has to attempt nine subjects in one part.
A proposal with regard to conducting the paper of Islamiat (compulsory) and Pakistan Studies (compulsory) in SSC level separately for 100 marks in each part instead of both parts of SSC exam was deliberated by the Punjab Boards Committee of Chairperson (PBCC) which was approved and decided as below: The proposed intervention was deliberated upon and approved the same as it would reduce the cumulative number of papers from nine to eight (part-I & part-II each) for the candidates of SSC examination.
The PBCC further decided that the matter may be taken up with Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board to revise the scheme accordingly and launch books of Islamiat and Pakistan Studies with model paper of 100 marks (for both subjects) for SSC part-I and part-II, respectively. For the session of 2024-2026, the paper will be administered for 100 marks for Islamiat in SSC part-I in 2025 and 100 marks for Pakistan Studies in SSC part-II in 2026.
The PCTB has been requested to initiate work for publishing and releasing a book of Islamiat (compulsory) with a model paper of 100 marks for SSC (ninth) students for 2024 and a book of Pakistan Studies with a model paper of 100 marks for students of SSC (10th) for 2025.

A counsel for the ECP told the court that the ban was related to the polling day only. He assured the court that the media can run public surveys and programmes about the elections.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi disposed of the petition in light of the statement of the ECP.
Journalist Muneer Ahmad Bajwa filed the petition challenging clause 12 of the code of conduct issued by the ECP for the electronic media and a subsequent notification by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) putting a ban on pre-election surveys and polls.
The petitioner through counsel Mian Dawood argued that the ECP for the first time introduced the impugned clause in its code of conduct for media issued under section 233 of the Election Act of 2017. He said the Pemra announced an action against the television channels for airing survey-based programmes in the electoral constituencies. He argued that the ECP imposed the impugned ban on the electronic, print, and digital media against the Constitution.
The counsel argued that clause 12 of the ECP code of conduct was contradictory to the fundamental rights of the citizens protected under articles 4, 19, and 19A of the Constitution.

4,"3 cops held for harassing, looting family outside hotel in Lahore",A case has been registered against the police officials over charges of extortion.,"LAHORE: Three police officials allegedly involved in harassing and extorting an amount of Rs50,000 from ‘an elite family’ outside a Gulberg restaurant have been arrested and sent behind bars after registration of a case over ‘extortion charges’.
The policemen took the family forcibly to a bank branch, accusing them of ‘involvement in immoral activities’ and got the money withdrawn through the ATM.
There were reports that the suspected police officials had been targeting couples outside the restaurants in Gulberg. The modus operandi was that they used to make video recordings of the couples sitting in cars and deprive them of their money and other belongings over the allegations of committing immoral activities.
Reports suggested that they used to take the ‘preys’ to the banks and withdraw money through ATM cards, hurling threats that they would upload the video on the social media or take them to the police station to lodge a criminal case against them.
An official privy to the information told Dawn that the matter came to the limelight as they had repeated the crime while targeting an elite family which was close to a high-ranked officer of a security institute.
The senior officer of the law-enforcement agency expressed his utter displeasure when the matter was reported to him by the victim family.
The official said he immediately called IGP Dr Usman Anwar and asked him to take notice of the incident. He said the police high-ups dispatched various teams to trace and arrest the policemen within hours.
The Gulberg police later arrested the cops who were identified as Umar Akram, Abbas and Irshad belonging to the operations wing of the Lahore police.
According to the FIR, the suspected police officials approached the car parked alongside Hali Road. They asked the family to come out of the vehicle and on questioning they accused them of committing immoral activities.
It further stated that the man, who was occupying the driving seat, told the police officials that the woman sitting in the car hailed from his family. On this, the policemen abused the man and threatened to take him to the police station to lodge a case of ‘involvement in immoral activities’, according to the FIR.
Meanwhile, one of the policemen demanded money from the man to avoid a criminal case. When he told the officials that he had no cash, they forcibly took him to a nearby bank at Main Boulevard, Gulberg, and got Rs50,000 drawn through his ATM card, reads the FIR. The official source said it was the second such incident.
Earlier, a racket of the officials from the Gulberg and Ghalib Market police stations had been detected some years back.
He said the policemen had recorded video films of several couples outside the restaurants and blackmailed them for money.
At that time the police high-ups had recovered several explicit video clips of the couples and families from the mobile phones of the policemen.
However, the matter was restricted to minor departmental punishments only as the police high-ups had feared that it might cause embarrassment for the department.

5,Work in progress to rectify six choke points on city roads,"LAHORE: In a bid to control smog, pollution and other environment and traffic-related issues, the construction work...","LAHORE: In a bid to control smog, pollution and other environment and traffic-related issues, the construction work at the six traffic choke points in the provincial capital has been launched. 
The work has been launched by the Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning Agency (Tepa) in the light of surveys amid traffic impact assessments etc to make all six choke points trouble-free on the directions of Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Dawn has learnt. 
“The work on these choke points, identified at Khayaban-i-Jinnah, Khayaban-i-Firdausi, Pine Avenue, Raiwind Road, Johar Town and Wapda Town, has been launched and is currently underway. 
An official, privy to the development, expressed hope that construction-related works would complete soon. 
According to a proposal prepared and floated by the Tepa chief engineer and approved by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) governing body in a recent meeting, the Punjab government has taken an initiative to identify the traffic choke points to provide relief to the public by combating the smog-related issues in the Punjab capital.  
In this regard, Tepa has been directed by CM Naqvi to survey the junctions and corridors of the city and prepare a plan for resolution of traffic issues at choke points. 
The proposal further reveals that some surveys were conducted and plans for rectification of the issues observed at different choke points and intersections were prepared. The plans, along with the rough cost estimation, were presented to the CM in a meeting on Nov 9. The CM appreciated the efforts of Tepa to resolve the traffic issues for alleviation of smog and directed the officials to submit a working paper for seeking administrative approval amounting to Rs700m from the CM-led LDA’s governing body. 
It mentions that the choke points included Qadir Topbash Chowk (Khyaban-i-Jinnah) that requires remodeling of the roundabout with protected U-turns along the Pine Avenue before exiting the roundabout, overlay on the area and installation/fixing of the road safety devices such as studs (cat’s eyes), lane marking, signage etc. The remodeling of this intersection will help the government reduce smog and carbon emissions through uninterrupted traffic flow. 
The other choke points included Khokhar Chowk (Johar Town) that required remodeling with provision of slip roads, overlay on the area, road safety devices etc, Gajjumata Chowk (Ferozepur Road) requiring remodeling through protected U-turns, median line along Hadiara Drain road, overlay, road safety devices etc, Jorray Pul Chowk, EME Chowk (Link Canal Bank Road starting from Thokar Niaz Baig towards EME Society and other localities) and Nishtar Chowk on Ferozepur Road. The total cost to be incurred to remodel these choke points included Rs195m, Rs105m, Rs120m, Rs110m, Rs120m and Rs50m, respectively. 
The approval of funds for these schemes under the maintenance and repair head has also been accorded by the governing body under which 50pc of the funds would be provided by the Punjab government. The remaining 50pc of the funds would be arranged by the LDA from its own financial sources. 
“The work on these schemes is being completed at a fast pace and hopefully the intersections and choke points would be remodeled within the next 15 days or so,” the official said. 
OPERATION: The Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has launched solid waste removal and disposal operations in the vicinity of the fish market and vegetable market, Badami Bagh and adjacent areas.  
According to a spokesman, the teams in the last 24 hours lifted and disposed of more than 5,000 tonnes of waste in the vicinities. More than 600 dumpers, 207 compactors, 75 chain arm rolls, and other machinery have been deployed while more than 10,000 sanitary workers are participating in the operations.

6,PPP leaders optimistic about Bilawal’s chances from Lahore,Denies impression that the party and the PML-N are 'facilitating' each other in upcoming polls.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which is exploring every avenue to find support for its chairman contesting the Feb 8 general elections from Lahore’s NA-127 constituency, denies the impression that the party and the PML-N are ‘facilitating’ each other in the upcoming polls.
“The impression of ‘friendly’ elections is wrong. The N League and the PPP are not facilitating each other,” claims PPP additional secretary general Zulfikar Ali Badr.
“Had it been the case [PML-N president] Shehbaz Sharif would have been contesting from Larkana instead of Karachi,” he argues replying to a questioner at a press conference here on Tuesday.
 
 

Flanked by party colleagues Aslam Gill, Mian Misbah, Faisal Mir and others, Badr, who is also in charge of the election campaign for NA-127, says Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will address a public meeting in the constituency on Jan 21. He says the chairman took a difficult and challenging decision to contest for the Lahore seat, which the party founder ZA Bhutto had won in the past.
Citing slain party chairperson Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s example, who had won from Lahore’s NA-94 constituency in 1988 and became prime minister, he hopes Bilawal too will win from NA-127 to claim the top office.
Badr, who is son of late PPP leader Jahangir Badr, says wherever Bilawal goes, he unifies the party and jiyalas shun their mutual disputes.
He regrets that whoever returned to the National Assembly from this constituency (NA-127) since 1988 ignored the area in terms of development and the people were facing innumerable issues there. It exposed the so-called performance of the PML-N as barring a few major arteries all other roads and streets in Lahore are in a shambles, he adds.
The PPP leader says the new delimitation of the NA-127 has created five provincial assembly seats under it, instead of the previous two, as is the case in other NA constituencies.
He says that from PP-160 (which falls under NA-127) Mian Misbah will contest and Faisal Mir from PP-161, while a decision the remaining Punjab Assembly seats will be taken within a day.
Mr Gill says Bilawal’s decision of contesting from Lahore will also positively impact other constituencies of Lahore as well as other districts in central Punjab.
Mir hopes the PPP will beat its political rivals in their stronghold on Feb 8.
Referring to the PPP’s election 10-point manifesto, Mian Misbah says that fulfilling these promises in five year-term won’t be a big deal.
Meanwhile, the PPP has paced up its efforts to seek support of smaller groups for its chairman in NA-127.
PPP provincial leader Mian Ateeq visited the Pakistan Awami Tehreek elders on Tuesday and discussed with them the political situation with reference to NA-127.

In a ceremonial act, the chief minister operated a crane and used a hoe to loosen and remove silt from the bed of Lahore Canal. This desiltation campaign has been initiated after almost a decade.  
The first phase of the campaign will continue until Jan 31, with the second phase involving the repair of embankments of 5,000-km-long canals over two months.  
This effort aims to make water available to an additional 0.3 to 0.4 million acres of land.
Mr Naqvi stated that the services of LIMS have been enlisted for round-the-clock monitoring of the desiltation drive through satellite images. The concerned staff, commissioners, and deputy commissioners have received training for this purpose. He mentioned that Nespak would also monitor the work as a third party.
Addressing concerns about drainage water being mixed in the Lahore Canal at some points, Mr Naqvi announced the formation of a committee comprising Wasa managing director and the deputy commissioner to investigate the matter. He appealed to citizens to avoid polluting the canal, emphasizing that the government cannot address all issues alone.
Tehreek-i-Istaqlal President Rehmat Khan Wardag expressed appreciation for Mr Naqvi’s initiative in launching the desiltation campaign.
He said desiltation on such a large scale had not been undertaken for a long time, the last instance being during the Musharraf regime.

It has also scheduled some programmes for children all over Punjab. 
PCA Executive Director Dr Syed Bilal Haider told Dawn the council took visual art as an important entity and started calligraphy and painting classes in all the divisional and district art councils.  
“The council is also trying to expand its offices for a better and comprehensive promotion of art and cultural activities. That’s why establishment of a new art councils in the first phase are being done in Jhang, Vehari, Muzaffargarh, Mianwali, Chakwal and Rahim Yar Khan while in second phase, the work has been started to establish arts councils in remaining 18 districts,” Mr Haider said. 
To empower divisional and district arts councils, including the financial matters, establishment of boards of management in all councils had been introduced while a public-private partnership model had been introduced for first time in arts councils in the form of a board of management that will set the long-term and short-term goals for the arts councils, he added. 
“Entrepreneurship is also being implemented to provide interest-free loans to students from art and culture disciplines, artisans and artists to do business in the cultural industry and to keep the dying art skills alive.” 
Mr Haider said a cinema in Murree, under the local arts council, had been restored and the Murree Museum and Art Gallery had been established there. The arts council, he added, had signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with 22 universities that had the departments of art and culture for innovative and research-based work for the promotion of art and culture. 
He said efforts were being made to preserve and practice dying music instruments and dying music art skills. The introduction of visual art classes would be a game-changer for smaller cities, which had immense talent among the youth, especially both in visual and performing arts.  
Dr Haider said that a talent hunt programme in music from district to provincial level would also be introduced and the age bracket for the talent hunt would be 12-18 years and 18-25 years. The programme would be unveiled from the second week of February.  
To this question that what council was doing regarding the reintroduction of its dance ensemble which no more existed now, Haider said the council had started classes in all divisions and districts of performing arts, including those of Kathak and acting, and hoped that the possibility of having a dance troupe on a permanent basis might be considered in the future.

14,New agency to combat rising cyber crimes,TOBA TEK SINGH: The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) is being established to counter the increasing...,"TOBA TEK SINGH: The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) is being established to counter the increasing incidents of cybercrimes, and stringent measures are being implemented to control smuggling.
This was stated by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Rai Ijaz Ahmad, who addressed the business community at the FCCI, says a press release.
He advised FCCI members to transition to transparent transactions through government channels instead of making payments through “hawala hundi”.  
He said while 50 per cent of remittances through hawala hundi dealers are related to genuine businessmen, the FIA prefers to overlook unintentional irregularities on a “Mens Rea” basis.
“Our focus should be on dismantling the network of such dealers,” he said, quoting the Financial Action Task Force and mentioning that Pakistan was placed in the grey list due to alleged money laundering.  
Mr Ahmad said the FIA, in close collaboration with state organisations and businesspeople, has been working to remove Pakistan from the grey list, and a separate dedicated anti-money laundering circle has been created to address the issue.
He said the Financial Management Unit in the State Bank of Pakistan is monitoring available financial data, “red-flagging” dubious, irregular, and disproportionate transactions. A team of senior officers examines these cases and sends suspicious transactions to the relevant departments or agencies for further investigation.
Businessmen were urged to exercise caution and refrain from engaging in illegal practices, as the monitoring system is set to become more stringent in the coming days. He explained the jurisdiction of FIA and other departments, noting that tax matters generally fall under the ambit of the FBR. However, any forgery or fraudulent transaction invokes the involvement of FIA.  
He emphasised that businessmen should make payments directly to the parties instead of using irrelevant accounts.
Suspicion, he noted, may arise if a textile owner makes an out-of-proportion payment to a cement or steel bar unit. Investigations would become apparent if a transaction of billions of rupees is made through the bank account of a low-paid salaried person. Mr Ahmad said that fake invoices, seemingly aimed at saving 2-3% income tax, often extend to rebates of 17-18pc, with the involvement of FBR officials and bank staff in many cases.
He said that government agencies aim not to harass genuine businessmen, but conscious efforts should be made to eliminate Hawala Hundi and Benami accounts.  
Ahmad suggested that FCCI should organise an awareness session on this subject to sensitize and educate its members about the potential involvement in illegal practices, whether intentional or unintentional.
Regarding ponzi housing schemes, he said it falls under NAB and Anti-Corruption Establishment, but the FIA may intervene if electricity is provided to such schemes without NOCs. He said the prevalence of the informal economy in Pakistan but emphasized the need to shift towards the documented economy. Strict measures, he warned, would be taken to curb smuggling, and businessmen were advised to avoid engaging in this illegal practice.

According to an official handout, Shaukat Basra appeared in the court of Mr Justice Sultan Tanveer Ahmed of LHC Bahawalpur Bench Election Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday.
In his confessional statement in the court, Basra submitted that learned judge’s court had not passed any order on his election appeal.
He sought an unconditional apology, saying that his social media post regarding acceptance of his petition was based on misunderstanding and was contrary to the facts.
Basra added that on issuing such unsuitable remarks on social media, he was submitting his whole-heatedly apology.
Justice Sultan Tanveer Ahmed said that it was enough that Shaukat Basra has realised his mistake.
Shaukat Basra, in a social media post, had claimed that the learned court had passed orders on his election petitions, accepting the plea.
