The Newlands contest lasted 642 balls with India registering a series-levelling victory in the shortest ever Test in which there has been a winner, beating Australia’s 656-ball victory over South Africa in 1932.
South Africa captain Dean Elgar, playing his farewell match, and India counterpart Rohit Sharma both felt the pitch was below-standard and many would feel the venue got away with a rather light punishment. 
“The pitch in Newlands was very difficult to bat on,” match referee Chris Broad said in an ICC statement. “The ball bounced quic­kly and sometimes alarmingly throughout the match, making it difficult to play shots. 
“Several batters were hit on the gloves and many wickets also fell due to the awkward bounce.” South Africa, electing to bat, were bundled out for 55 in their first innings and spinners were not used at all by either of the sides.
Hosts Cricket South Africa have 14 days to appeal against the sanction.
Under the ICC rules, “unsatisfactory” rating incur one demerit point, three points are slapped if a venue is found ‘unfit’ under the governing body’s pitch and outfield monitoring process.
These points will remain active for a rolling five-year period.
If a venue accumulates six demerit points in that period, it is suspended from hosting any international cricket for 12 months.

1,"Ostapenko, Garcia progress in Adelaide but Vondrousova out",ADELAIDE: Wimbledon champion Mark­eta Vondro­usova pulled out of the Adelaide International with a hip injury...,"ADELAIDE: Wimbledon champion Mark­eta Vondro­usova pulled out of the Adelaide International with a hip injury Tuesday just days before the Australian Open, as Jelena Ostapenko set up a clash against Caroline Garcia. 
Czech world number seven Vondrousova began her season at the United Cup, beating Serbia’s Olga Danilovic and losing to China’s Zheng Qinwen. 
She was seeded three in Adelaide and due to play her first-round match on Tuesday evening. But the WTA said she had withdrawn, citing a hip injury. It was not clear how serious the problem was. 
Former French Open winner Ostapenko, the Latvian sixth seed and world number 12, needed three sets to get past Sorana Cirstea 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, enjoying a modicum of revenge after the Romanian beat her at Wimbledon last year. 
She lost serve twice in the first set before waking up. 
“I was sleeping in the first set, I’m not really a morning person,” she said after a morning start at Memorial Drive. “It took me time to wake up and get into the match. I’m glad I managed to win it.” 
Ostapenko recovered to win six games out of seven and reach 3-1 in the final set. The Latvian raced into a 5-2 lead but was broken serving for the match. She blew two match points at 5-3 before sealing victory with her sixth ace. 
“I like to play in Australia,” the 2023 Australian Open quarter-finalist said. “Conditions are good for me. Sometimes I get too worked up but then I calm down and play better.” 
She will next play former world number four Garcia, now ranked 20th, who also avoided an upset, coming from a break down in the final set to defeat Australian wildcard Taylah Preston 6-4, 1-6, 6-3. 
Germany’s Laura Siegemund, part of the country’s winning United Cup team, dismissed seventh seed Liudmila Samsonova 6-7 (1/7), 6-4, 6-4. 
Eighth seed Veronika Kudermetova also progressed, but former world number one Karolina Pliskova lost 6-2, 6-1 to qualifier Katerina Siniakova in an all-Czech match-up. 
STEPHENS OUSTED IN HOBART 
At the WTA Hobart International, Sloane Stephens’s Australian Open buildup suffered a blow after the former US Open champion lost 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) to China’s Yuan Yue in the first round. 
The duo slugged it out for nearly three hours before the Chinese world number 73 secured a memorable victory. 
Having split the first two sets, Yuan broke Stephens when the American was serving for the match at 6-5. Stephens led 5-4 in the tiebreak but could not hold on to her advantage. 
“I’m very happy and excited to win,” a beaming Yuan said. “She’s a Grand Slam champion. At home, I’d [often] watch her play on the TV. I’m happy to be here (playing against her),” she said of her opponent. 
Former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin began her campaign at the Melbourne Park warm-up event with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Greet Minnen of Belgium. 
Kenin, who saved all three break points she faced, will meet Daria Saville for a spot in the quarter-finals. 
Britain’s Emma Raducanu withdrew from a charity match in Melbourne on Tuesday, which was part of her Australian Open buildup, the BBC reported. 
Her original opponent Naomi Osaka had pulled out earlier and was replaced by Donna Vekic for the contest, which was cancelled.

3,"Loeb wins Dakar stage four, Al Rajhi stretches overall lead",American Ricky Brabec is third overall after finishing second in the stage.,"AL HOFUF: Sebastien Loeb took stage four of the Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as home favourite Yazeed Al Rajhi stretched his overall lead in the car category.
Nine-time world rally champion Loeb, racing a Prodrive Hunter for the Bahrain Raid Xtreme team, finished the 299km stage from Al Salamiya to the oasis city of Al Hofuf one minute and eight seconds faster than Toyota’s Al Rajhi.
Qatar’s reigning champion Nasser Al-Attiyah, who had held a comfortable lead at the penultimate checkpoint, was third fastest in another Prodrive Hunter and moved up to third overall from fifth.
Al Rajhi now leads Audi’s Spanish triple Dakar winner Carlos Sainz, fourth in Tuesday’s stage, by four minutes and 29 seconds.
Loeb moved up to sixth overall from ninth, 23 minutes and 50 seconds off the lead, after the 49-year-old’s 24th career Dakar stage win and first this year.
The Frenchman was also the fifth different stage winner, including the prologue, in as many days.
“We did a clean stage. We were a bit in the dust for sure, because we started far back and we had to overtake a lot of cars,” said Loeb.
“At one point we missed a way point and had to go back for about 30 seconds, but for the rest we did a very good stage, so no problems.” 
Toyota’s American driver Seth Quintero hit trouble early in the stage, stopping with mechanical issues after 81km and requiring assistance that dropped him hours behind.
In the motorcycle category, Chilean Jose Ignacio ‘Nacho’ Cornejo took over at the top after his second stage win of this year’s event.
Botswana’s overnight leader Ross Branch reached the finish with twisted handlebars on his Hero machine and losing nearly four-and-a-half minutes to Cornejo, who leads him by a minute and 15 seconds.
“I thought Id try bent-style handlebars today. No, really it was a rough day for me, one of the days Id rather forget. I crashed after 40 km just trying to look at the roadbook and I hit a rock,” said Branch.
“Then I crashed again 20 km before the finish just going into the dunes. There was a bit of camel grass hidden in the sand and that threw me over the handlebars. But Im OK, the bike is repairable.”
American Ricky Brabec was third overall after finishing second in the stage.

4,‘Beckenbauer commemoration should be held in stadium’,MUNICH: German football fans should fill Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena to properly commemorate the life of Germany...,"MUNICH: German football fans should fill Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena to properly commemorate the life of Germany great Franz Beckenbauer who died aged 78 on Sunday, former team-mate and ex-Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on Tuesday.
Beckenbauer, who was Germany’s first truly global sports star and led them to the World Cup title as player and coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively, had become part of the country’s social fabric in a hugely successful career on and off the pitch spanning over 50 years.
Beckenbauer, considered one of the best players of all-time, won 103 caps and captained West Germany to World Cup success in 1974, two years after lifting the European title.
He also headed the organising committee for the 2006 World Cup held in Germany.
“The whole world of football and beyond is grieving for our friend Franz,” Rummenigge, who played alongside Beckenbauer at Bayern Munich in the 1970s, told Bild newspaper.
Rummenigge, a former longtime Bayern CEO, was West Germany’s captain under coach Beckenbauer in the 1986 World Cup where they lost to Argentina in the final.
“As a thank you and in remembrance FC Bayern should organise a commemoration in the stadium which would not have existed without him,” he said.
Bayern said on Tuesday the stadium would be illuminated to honour Beckenbauer for the coming days. 
“In memory of the ‘Kaiser’, the Allianz Arena will light up with  the words  “Thank you Franz” in the evening hours of 16:30 to 22:00 CET  over the coming days,” the club said. 
“To finish, the special illumination will also be seen... on  Friday night, during FC Bayern’s home match against Hoffenheim.”
The  Bundesliga resumes on Friday after the winter break. 
Beckenbauer was part of the mighty Bayern Munich team who won three consecutive European Cups from 1974-76 among other titles.
He became the team coach and club president after his playing career, establishing the German champions as one of the most successful and valuable brands in European football.
“Franz Beckenbauer was the leader of the German football for many  decades,” 1990 World Cup winner Juergen Klinsmann said.  “He was with  Pele the best player in the world in the 60s, 70s, 80s. He coached  us to win the World Cup, he won the World Cup. He brought the World Cup  to Germany 2006,” added Klinsmann, who now coaches the South Korean  national team. 
“He was almost like a father and so I think the football world is  very, very sad but especially Germany loses its most charismatic leader  in sports over the last many decades.”
The club, under the presidency of Beckenbauer, left the ageing Olympic stadium and moved to their purpose-built Allianz Arena in 2006.
A stadium ceremony is not the only proposal to remember the  “Kaiser”, a nickname he earned for his playing style and vision of the game.
Fellow 1974 World Cup winner Bertie Vogts suggested renaming the German Cup the Beckenbauer Cup to ensure his memory lives on.
“Maybe the German FA (DFB) should consider renaming for example the German Cup after Franz Beckenbauer,” Vogts told the Rheinische Post newspaper. “It is important that his name is not forgotten by the football generations that follow.”

7,Qatar under pressure in Asian Cup defence after abrupt Queiroz axing,DOHA: Qatar go into the Asian Cup starting on Friday as hosts and holders but the shock axing of Carlos Queiroz as...,"DOHA: Qatar go into the Asian Cup starting on Friday as hosts and holders but the shock axing of Carlos Queiroz as coach last month has thrown their title defence into serious question.
Prior to that, the talk was about how Qatar would right the wrongs of a disappointing early exit from their home World Cup just over a year ago.
Qatar’s three straight defeats was the worst performance of any World Cup host in history.
Former Real Madrid and Portugal coach Queiroz took over following the departure of Felix Sanchez, but in early December the Portuguese was sacked and replaced by Tintin Marquez.
Marquez is a familiar face to Qatari fans because he coached Al Wakrah in the domestic league and has a long relationship with football in the Gulf state.
“In football all the time there is pressure,” the 62-year-old Spaniard told AFP soon after his sudden appointment. “More important for the players is enjoying the match,” he said, downplaying the idea that his side was under pressure to make up for their World Cup flop.
Qatar open the Asian Cup on Friday when they face Lebanon at the 88,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, which staged the World Cup final.
Queiroz, who coached Iran at the World Cup and was assistant to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, had a four-year contract with Qatar. He won five, lost five and drew two during his tenure.
Qatar’s football association gave no reason for the decision to get rid of him and the move, and its timing, baffled many.
Former national team player Raed Yaqoub said Queiroz had started the  “positive” work of refreshing Qatar’s starting line-up to  “give other names a chance”.
Interfering with that, said the player-turned-pundit, was  “a big mistake”.
Yaqoub said that although Marquez is popular and well known in Qatar,  “I think that holding him responsible only a month before the tournament is a mistake”.
Mohamed Mubarak al-Mohannadi, another former national player, said the switch so close to the Asian Cup left the team  “facing the gun” given the difficulty  “for any coach to make the required transformation within a month’s period”.
Marquez’s first game in charge, at the end of December, was a 3-0 win over a Cambodia team which failed to qualify for the regional championship.
The Spaniard, who played for Espanyol, said it was  “important” that he knew Qatari football.
“I know the players, I know my mentality and I know... my idea for playing,” he said, explaining he was not  “arriving new”.
Publicly at least the players have welcomed his appointment.
Defender Tarek Salman told AFP the change meant the team would need to adapt to a Spanish style, but added:  “I think it’s going to fit us and we hope to achieve good things with the coach.”
He insisted that the expectations on the team were not the same as they had been going into the first World Cup in the Middle East.

“I had a really long and fulfilling 26 years of football life” between 1998 and 2023, Endo said in a video message posted on the club’s website. “I never thought I’d play this long,” the 43-year-old added.
Endo was in Japan’s World Cup squad for three times and was named Asian player of the year in 2009.
He won 152 Japan caps, a record.
Having spent nearly two decades at Gamba Osaka as a footballer, Endo said he’s  “very happy” to be back as a coach.
“As a coach, I am still learning... but I want to grow with the players and contribute to the team’s victories,” he said.
Kozo Tashima, president of the Japan Football Association, said Endo posses the ability  “to make decisions calmly” and  “high level of (football) skills.”
“I hope he will use his experience and achievements for the development of Japanese football.”

The 34-year-old Kenyan-born Olympian was found dead on a road on the outskirts of the Rift Valley town of Eldoret in the early hours of New Year’s Eve with a stab wound to his neck.
Both Kenya and his adopted country Uganda have laid claim to the steeplechase runner, but his brother Vincent Chemweno told AFP on Tuesday he would be buried at the family farm in the village of Kamendi, more than 60 kilometres from Eldoret.
“We are making all the necessary arrangements for the funeral where we expect a host of fellow athletes and politicians,” said Chemweno.
Kiplagat had represented Uganda internationally in the 3,000m steeplechase, including at three Olympic Games and six World Championships.
Two men were charged in Kenya on Jan 2 over his death and were ordered detained for 21 days to enable police to continue investigations.
While the motive remains unknown, police have said Kiplagat had been  “waylaid” by the two men before he hit their motorcycle with his car.
Chemweno said the family believes Kiplagat, who leaves behind an expectant wife and a 13-year-old daughter, was not specifically targeted but fell victim to thieves.

The 19-year-old Fils cruised to a 6-3, 6-4 victory against the 37-year-old Gasquet, who had enjoyed a remarkable 956 consecutive weeks in the top 100, peaking at number seven in July 2007.
Gasquet was defending the Auckland title and points he won 12 months ago, so the first-round defeat will see him slide down from 76th in the world when new rankings are released next week.
Fils, with a booming serve that produced nine aces, broke at 2-2 in the first set and at 1-1 in the second and applauded Gasquet as he left the court.
“He’s a great champion. He did an unbelievable career so I’m really happy to play on the court with him,” said Fils, who reached the quarter-finals of the Hong Kong Open last week. But it was a nice match for my part and I’m really happy.”
In other action on Tuesday, Canada’s Denis Shapovalov looked rusty in his first match since Wimbledon last year, losing Austria’s Sebastian Ofner 6-4, 6-2.
Roberto Bautista Agut was beaten by fellow Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena 6-4, 6-4 and eighth seed Max Purcell of Australia overcame New Zealand’s 716th-ranked wildcard Kiranpal Pannu 6-4, 6-4.

12,"Dalot, Fernandes goals put United into FA Cup fourth round","“The FA Cup is all about winning, it is knockout. You want to finish the job. That is what I said in the dressing room ‘job done’,” says ten Hag.","WIGAN: Manchester United’s Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes, with a penalty, secured a 2-0 win at Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup fourth round on a bitterly cold night at DW Stadium on Monday.
The victory over the third-tier side was a welcome relief for the 12-time FA Cup winners, who are out of Europe and the League Cup and languishing eighth in the Premier League.
“The FA Cup is all about winning, it is knockout. You want to finish the job. That is what I said in the dressing room ‘job done’,” United manager Erik ten Hag told ITV.
This competition represents United’s final shot at silverware this season and could prove a lifeline for Ten Hag, whose side comfortably avoided an eighth defeat in 14 away matches in all competitions since last season’s FA Cup final, which they lost to neighbours Manchester City.
Dalot scored in the 22nd minute at Wigan when Marcus Rashford had a shot blocked before laying the ball off to the Portuguese, who took a touch before finding the bottom corner of the net from just outside the 18-yard box.
Fernandes doubled United’s lead in the 74th with a penalty after Liam Shaw caught the captain’s foot in the box.
United also wasted a bucket load of chances. Ten Hag’s side had 33 shots, 14 on target, compared to Wigan’s nine. Rashford had eight attempts, four on target.
“Oh, definitely [we should have scored more],” Ten Hag said. “In the first half I think we created five or six very good chances. I think it was very good football. We should have taken more, but if you don’t score you have to stay focused and I think we did that tonight.”
The Red Devils were also handed a favourable fourth round draw against the winners of the third round replay between League Two (fourth tier) Newport County and National League (fifth tier) Eastleigh F.C.
Holders City face a tricky trip to Tottenham Hotspur, while in-form Aston Villa have been drawn to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.
Third-placed champions City are a point above Spurs with a game in hand in the Premier League table, while Villa are flying high in second spot with Chelsea languishing 10th.
Premier League leaders Liverpool will host Norwich City or Bristol Rovers after beating Arsenal 2-0 in the pick of the third round ties.
Fulham welcome Newcastle United and Sheffield United host Brighton & Hove Albion in other all-Premier League ties, with matches scheduled to be played over the Jan. 27-28 weekend.
Sixth-tier Maidstone United, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, travel to second-tier Ipswich Town. The winners of the replay between Crystal Palace and Everton will host either Luton Town or Bolton Wanderers.
League Two side Wrexham A.F.C., owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney and who reached the fourth round last season, will visit Blackburn Rovers.

AUCKLAND: New Zealand opening batter Devon Conway believes his side’s familiarity with touring Pakistan will hold them in good stead when the five-match Twenty20 International series begins from Friday. 
The Black Caps toured Pakistan in April last year, the five-match series ending in a 2-2 draw and Conway said his side has an idea on how their opponents “approach the game”. 
“We have played a lot of cricket against Pakistan, particularly in white-ball cricket,” Conway said in a video shared by New Zealand Cricket on Tuesday. “They’re a very skillful unit with bat and ball. They’ve got some really quality fast bowling and some quality batters up front. 
“So, for us, we’ve got a good idea as to how they approach things, and it’s always a good challenge playing against Pakistan specifically in white-ball cricket.” 
The series opener will be held in Eden Park with the next game to be played in Hamilton’s Seddon Park. The University Oval in Dunedin is the venue for the third game with the last two matches of the series being played at Christchurch’s Hagley Oval. 
“It’s always exciting … I think the opening game at Eden Park is very exciting,” said Conway. “We generally get a really good crowd there, and the atmosphere is electric at Eden Park. It’s a great opportunity for us to travel up and down the country, play at different venues, and play in front of our home fans. So, we’re looking forward to it.” 
Pakistan, led by newly-appointed captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, held their first training session of the tour at Eden Park on Tuesday with fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Zaman Khan and spinner Usama Mir joining the squad after their commitments in Australia’s Big Bash League.
Shaheen, former skipper Babar Azam, wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan, top-oder batter Saim Ayub and all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz also travelled from Australia after featuring in the three-match Test series which Pakistan lost 3-0 to the hosts. 
Other members of the squad, including opener Fakhar Zaman, travelled from Pakistan after a preparatory camp in Lahore with the team holding a three-hour practice session.
Slinger Zaman was seen bowling at full tilt in the nets. He impressed in the BBL once again, bowling searing yorkers against Glenn Maxwell. 
Zaman bowled out Maxwell with one of his yorkers, which became one of the moments of the match between Sydney Thunder and Melbourne Stars.
One of the videos of the session posted on platform X, formerly Twitter, showed Shaheen hitting a no-look shot. 
There were also hints dropped that Pakistan could have a new opening pair of Saim and Rizwan, who faced facers Shaheen, Haris and Zaman.  
Babar, who used to open with recently-named vice-captain Rizwan, was seen facing spinners. 
Conway, who had been featuring in the Super Smash — New Zealand’s domestic T20 competition, said it was nice to link up with the national team again. He had sat out the recent three-match T20 series against Bangladesh which ended in a 1-1 draw. 
“It’s always nice to see the guys again, and yeah, looking forward to spending some time with the group,” he said. “Yeah, it’s been great to have a nice break. 
“Grateful to NZC for allowing me the opportunity to have this break, but yeah, certainly very exciting coming into T20 cricket. It brings that exciting factor, so yeah, looking forward to the series coming up. 
“There’s a lot of cricket coming up, and as a player, you want to play as much as you can. There’s a good mixture of T20 cricket and Test Cricket against quality teams. So, you know, there’s not more you can ask for as a player.” 
Conway was also looking forward to opening the batting with the explosive Finn Allen. 
“It’s been great to see how Finn’s been going,” he said. “He’s a very dynamic, exciting player to watch, and he’s been doing really well in the Super Smash. He’s a great guy to open the batting with because he’s very powerful and makes your role quite easy to get him on strike.
