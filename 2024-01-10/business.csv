0,Economic Coordination Committee okays mechanism for urea pricing,Growers to pay Rs170 more for 50-kg urea bag.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Tuesday sanctioned Rs250 million in additional funds for the Intelligence Bureau and approved a mechanism for basket price for imported and local urea that would make costlier the key agricultural ingredient by Rs160-170 per bag.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar also approved about Rs3.67 billion in grants for the Federal Directorate of Immunisation and Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF). “The ECC approved the mechanism for weighted average price with the direction to National Fertiliser Marketing Ltd (NFML) for ensuring reasonable price for urea and Ministry of Industries & Production to provide oversight to the whole process”, said an official statement.
The Ministry of Industries, NFML and local urea manufacturers would now work out the final sale price based on the mix of local production and imported fertiliser including other expenses. Therefore, the minimum retail price (MRP) that currently ranges between Rs3,600 to Rs3,980 per 50kg bag would go up by Rs160 to Rs170 to Rs3,770 to Rs4,100 per bag.
A senior industries ministry official told Dawn that the meeting appreciated the ‘reasonable price’ secured from Azerbaijan’s Socar Trading for 220,000 tonnes of urea on a G2G basis. He said the meeting was told that previous ECC and cabinet meetings had decided on multiple occasions over the past two months that the subsidy on imported urea would be borne by the provinces.

Growers to pay Rs170 more for 50-kg urea bag

The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) reported the total subsidy cost at about Rs27.5bn and the landed cost of imported urea at about Rs6,250 per bag of 50kg. On top of this would be incidental charges of about Rs4.9bn, according to NFML, thus taking the total subsidy requirement to Rs30.4bn.
However, the Punjab government has contended that it would bear only 50pc cost while Sindh agreed to pay the full cost of subsidy for 53,000 tonnes of urea (24pc of 220,000 tonnes) but Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa did not respond.
The ECC also approved a request of the Intelligence Bureau for the provision of Rs250m in additional funds during 2023-24. The bureau briefed the committee about the recent surge in terrorism activities which needed effective countermeasures to thwart nefarious designs of terrorists. 
The ECC also approved a request of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination for the release of Rs100m for the participation of the national hockey team in international events and other sports promotion activities. This grant, ECC was told would also be utilised for Davis Cup (Tennis) with India and other mind games like Scrabble and Chess.

1,GSP+ helps double Pakistan exports to EU: envoy,"The business community of Karachi should broaden and diversify their exports to the EU to take maximum advantage of GSP+, says the EU ambassador.","KARACHI: Ambassa­dor of the European Union Raina Kionka has said that the GSP+ status for Pakistan has been rolled over without any changes to the rules of framework so everything was going to stay the same up to 2027.
“We also have elections in June 2024, which means there will be a political changeover in the parliament and the EU’s Commission. Once everything settles, we expect that the new parliament and the Council of EU member states will once again take up negotiations on a new directive for GSP+ with Pakistan which couldn’t happen last year,” she said while addr­essing the members of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Tuesday.
Although it’s a four-year rollover for GSP+, if they come up with a new regulation, it will become effective before 2027, she added.
According to KCCI’s press release, the EU ambassador said that rather than staying confined to exporting textiles only, the business community of Karachi should broaden and diversify their exports to the EU to take maximum advantage of GSP+.
“GSP+ is tremendously important for Pakistan’s economy whose overwhelming beneficiaries are not just textile producers but also workers in textile factories,” she said, adding that GSP+ has been extremely positive and useful in economic terms during the last 10 years as it helped in increasing Pakistan’s exports to EU by 108pc while EU imports also ascended by 40pc since the start of this scheme.
While identifying gems and jewellery, tourism, handcrafts and auto parts as potential sectors under GSP+, she said that the EU’s delegation in Islamabad would also like to set up a platform to promote EU-Pakistan business-to-business relations which could also help the SMEs in making good connections with businesses in EU and ultimately help the SMEs in Pakistan to also benefit from GSP+.
Earlier, KCCI President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh said that the EU has been the largest export destination for Pakistan, which stood at $8.4 billion, followed by the US at $5.93bn and China at $2.02bn in FY23.
Pakistan’s exports to the EU are dominated by the textiles sector and last year, Pakistan’s total textile exports remained at $16.50bn which is almost 60pc of the total exports.
He said Pakistan and the EU need to discuss ways to improve Pakistani products’ access to the EU market, address trade barriers, foster collaboration, focus on export diversification, and ensure smoother trade practices and compliance with international standards.

2,Gohar woos investors from MENA region,"Says the focus is on facilitating investments and making markets more accessible, contributing to the broader goals of economic growth and cooperation.","KARACHI: Caretaker Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz has reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to making Pakistani markets accessible to the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region aimed at tapping the potential for collaboration in agriculture, textiles, engineering, and services.
“This commitment aligns seamlessly with the Look Africa Policy, emphasising Pakistan’s objective to unlock its economic and trade potential, Mr Gohar said while engaging in discussions with Egypt’s Commerce Minister Ahmed Samir who was also the chief guest of the 4th Pakistan-Africa Trade Development Conference (PATDC) and Single Country Exhibition (SCE) in Cairo on Tuesday.
The focus is on facilitating investments and making markets more accessible, contributing to the broader goals of economic growth and cooperation, he added.
He said the 4th PATDC and SCE not only serve as a platform for bilateral discussions but also as a catalyst for the exchange of ideas and strategies to en­hance economic ties. “The event sets the stage for further collaboration, paving the way for increa­sed cooperation and mutual prosperity, Mr Gohar remarked.
Both parties recognised the mutual benefits that can arise from expanding economic and trade ties. The meeting, held in the presence of policymakers and business leaders from various countries, facilitated a convergence of diverse ideas and opinions, creating an enriching environment for meaningful discussions.
The discussions underscored the commitment of both nations to deepening economic cooperation and leveraging each other’s strengths in key sectors.
According to the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), this is the first time Pakistan is bringing 100-plus companies to Egypt to enhance trade and economic cooperation and open new horizons between Egypt and Pakistan.

3,Red tape hinders power to Rashakai Economic Zone,"The success of any SEZ, including Rashakai, is not solely dependent on the provision of electricity, but rather on the availability of affordable and stable electricity.","ISLAMABAD: Bureau­cratic hurdles are leading to unnecessary delays in supply of electricity to industrial units in the country’s first Special Eco­nomic Zone (SEZ) at Rashakai, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa.
It is a key component of the China-Pakistan Eco­nomic Corridor (CPEC).
The first phase of SEZ, which comprises 247 acres under the CPEC, was completed six months ago and plots were assigned to 18 industrial units.
Seven of these units have nearly finalised their setups and are poised to commence operations, according to official documents.
Most of the units set up in the SEZ are export-oriented, with a few focused on import substitution. The delay in electricity supply is a growing concern for these industrial units, potentially impacting their operations and overall negative signals to prospective investors.
Investors, among them overseas Pakistanis and one Chinese, are trying hard to secure electricity and gas connections, but caretaker ministers appear to be preoccupied with foreign visits and election-focused projects.
The Rashakai SEZ is the second in KP officially approved by the federal Board of Investment (BOI) under the SEZ Act of 2012. Under this law, the federal and provincial governments are bound to supply gas, electricity, and other utilities to the designated zero point of an SEZ.
The transmission lines for electricity designed to supply 160 MW have already been extended to the zero point of the SEZ. Additionally, a 132 KV grid station at Rashakai has been completed. Development work inside the SEZ has also been completed.
The China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), a co-developer of the SEZ, applied to the power regulator (Nepra) for a licence six months ago. This licence would allow CRBC to supply electricity to industrial units within the SEZ.
The application was submitted through a special purpose vehicle company_ Rashakai Special Economic Zone Develop­ment and Management Company (RSEZDOC).
The licence is needed to supply and purchase power from the Peshawar Electricity Supply Com­pany (Pesco) .
The prevailing tariff for single-point supply (over 132KV) from Pesco falls under the C-3 (commercial category), which is higher than industrial category tariffs ranging from B-1 to B-4.
Red tape
Federal bureaucrats have shown reluctance in offering industrial tariffs to industries within Rashakai SEZ, despite the availability of B-4 industrial tariffs to units in Lahore’s Sundar Industrial Estate.
“We believe that the high tariff will not only discourage investment but will also affect the Chinese enterprises’ relocation to Rashakai SEZ”, the provincial caretaker Minister for Industries and Commerce, Aamer Abdullah, told Dawn on Tuesday.
Mr Abdullah said he had raised the matter with the Nepra chief. “Later I approached Care­taker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, who instructed the federal minister for energy and power to hold a meeting with us,” he said. This led to a meeting between the KP team and the federal ministry.
“I have been pursuing this matter since assuming my ministerial role four months ago,” he added, expressing disappointment over the lack of progress thus far.
Official documents indicate that enterprises at the Rashakai SEZ will be charged a higher rate of electricity compared to other industries in the country. This could potentially discourage investment and hinder the achievement of industrial cooperation objectives between China and Pakistan.
The success of any SEZ, including Rashakai, is not solely dependent on the provision of electricity, but rather on the availability of affordable and stable electricity.

4,First-ever Rs2bn fund for start-ups launched,"“The PSF [Pakistan Start-up Fund] is designed to lower the risk for international investors to invest in Pakistani start-ups,"" says Caretaker Minister for IT and Telecom Dr Umar Saif.","ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Minister for IT and Telecom Dr Umar Saif on Tuesday launched the first-ever Pakistan Start-up Fund (PSF) worth Rs2 billion to attract venture investments and position local start-ups as significant players on the global stage.
Ignite National Technology Fund will take charge as the executing body of the PSF and ensure transparency through an independent steering body overseeing the operations.
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Dr Umar Saif said that the government will allocate up to Rs2bn for PSF every year, and the fund is structured as equity-free capital to help close a venture capital round for a start-up.
The PSF was designed to help a startup raise its first external investment.
The minister said that $800 million has been invested in Pakistani start-ups in the last four years.
Under the system, the PSF will give 30pc grant for the investments of the total requirement for the start-up.
“The PSF is designed to lower the risk for international investors to invest in Pakistani start-ups, we hope to create a value of at least Rs50 billion per year in the start-up ecosystem in Pakistan”, the caretaker minister said.
He added that the fund represents a transformative initiative in the realm of entrepreneurship and technological innovation.
“Pakistan Start-up Fund will accelerate economic growth and innovation in the country, and it will underwrite the risk of Venture capitalists by providing equity-free grants to start-ups as the last cheque in an investment round,” the caretaker minister said.
He added that the fund will connect innovative start-ups, venture capitalists and investors, while the IT ministry will be supporting technological innovation and entrepreneurship.
The country has over 4,000 active startups supported by eight National Innovation Centres.

5,Pakistan advances water resilience through tech,AADB report advises using high-level remote sensing technology and mathematical programming techniques for canal management.,"ISLAMABAD: With the novel application of high-level technology combining satellite remote sensing and mathematical modelling supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), water and land management will be improved for more than 750,000 hectares of agricultural land in Punjab.
The Water-Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF)-supported approach has enabled the application of the new technology which has been used elsewhere to inform farmers of irrigation requirements at the farm scale. WFPF is pivotal in enhancing ADB’s operations and responding to the Asia-Pacific region’s challenges by delivering ‘business-as-usual’.
An ADB report highlights that utilising high-level remote sensing technology and mathematical programming techniques for canal management in Punjab will benefit approximately 2 million people. 
This intervention enhances resilience to climate changes and improves social equity through rotation corrections, leading to increased food production, farm profitability, and reduced income disparity. The approach offers a cost-effective alternative to infrastructure rehabilitation, showcasing potential for expansion and replication in future irrigation modernisation projects.
The Pakistan activity has brought together farmers, government agencies, leading universities, researchers, canal operators, and consultants to develop innovative technology. It installed sensors and has developed the decision support system to establish a responsive distributary rotation that promotes equity in access to water among farming families to increase their climate resilience.
