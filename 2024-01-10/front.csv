0,PTI missing from ECP election symbols’ list,Appellate tribunals to conclude hearing of nomination papers appeals today,"The Election Commission on Tuesday sent the details of election symbols of political parties to the returning officers (ROs), according to which, the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians has been allotted the ‘arrow’ symbol, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Nazaryati ‘ballay baz’ (batsman), and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ‘tiger’.
According to details, the Election Commission sent letters to the ROs of national and provincial assemblies regarding the details of the election symbols for the upcoming general elections. The electoral body sent the election symbols of 145 political parties to the ROs.
In the letter, it was stated that the respective election symbol should be allotted to the candidates nominated by the political parties. “The election symbols of political parties should not be given to any independent candidate,” the ROs were instructed in a letter.
The ROs were directed to allot the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party the election symbol of an ‘eagle’, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement ‘kite’, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam ‘book’ and the Jamaat-e-Islami ‘scale’. The names of various political parties, including the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, were not included in the list of electoral symbols.

The symbols of these political parties have been withheld due to non-conduct of intra-party elections. Meanwhile, the appellate tribunals are expected to complete the process of hearing the appeals against acceptance or rejection of nomination papers of candidates for the general elections 2024 on Wednesday (today).
According to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) spokesperson on Tuesday, the tribunals headed by high court judges would conclude hearing of the appeals on Wednesday and the revised list of candidates would be published on Thursday.
“The withdrawal of nomination papers is scheduled for Jan 12 (Friday) and the final list of candidates will also be released on the same day,” he said. The allocation of election symbols to the candidates was slated for Jan 13 (Saturday), and the polling would take place on Feb 8, the spokesperson added.
Meanwhile, the appellate tribunals on Tuesday dismissed the appeals of Fawad Chaudhry and Murad Saeed, challenging the rejection of their nomination papers for contesting the upcoming elections. The appellate tribunal of the Lahore High Court's Rawalpindi bench dismissed Fawad's appeal against the decision taken by the returning officer, rejecting his nomination papers from NA-60 and NA-61, Jehlum. The rejection is a significant political setback for the former federal information minister.

Tribunal’s Justice Chaudhary Abdul Aziz, in announcing the decision, sustained all objections against Fawad and upheld the returning officer's verdict. The court revealed that Fawad concealed his wife's bank accounts and foreign trips, failed to submit an affidavit, and also obscured details about his movable and immovable assets.
Consequently, Fawad is now out of the election race, as is his wife Hiba Chaudhry who has already been disqualified. Advocate Faisal Chaudhry stated that the couple plans to challenge the tribunal's decision in a higher court.
Meanwhile, in Swat, the tribunal rejected PTI leader Murad Saeed's appeal and affirmed the RO's decision to reject his papers. The court noted that Murad's power of attorney lacked attestation, and he did not personally appear before the tribunal.
Murad had submitted papers for NA-3 and NA-4. Previously, an election tribunal in Rawalpindi recalled its decision of approving the nomination papers of former minister Fawad, while rejecting the nomination paper of his wife Hiba Chaudhry for not declaring assets.
The appellate tribunals in Punjab also rejected the appeal of senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and threw out the objections raised against the acceptance of the nomination papers of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz.
In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), meanwhile, several PTI heavyweights won the appeals against the rejection of their nomination papers by the ROs concerned during the scrutiny process that concluded last weekend.

1,Three more cops martyred as terrorists step up attack on K-P police,10 police officials have died in terrorist attacks since January 8,"Police remain in the crosshairs of terrorists in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as three more cops gave up their lives in the line of duty on Wednesday heightening concerns about the security situation ahead of the election scheduled for next month.
The situation in K-P’s southern and erstwhile tribal districts remains particularly volatile as 10 police officials have been martyred there in a series of attacks over the last three days. Elsewhere in the restive province, Pakistan Army killed two terrorists in Lakki Marwat district in a gunfight that also left two servicemen martyred.
Officials confirmed that four people, including three policemen, were martyred in a late Tuesday night assault on a police post in Kohat. Around one dozen heavily armed terrorists opened fire and hurled hand grenades at the post situated near Lachi Toll Plaza on the Indus Highway.
Three cops identified as head constables Amjad and Junaid, and constable Waqar embraced martyrdom. The fourth fatality has been identified as Noor Muhammad, an employee of the toll plaza.
Taking advantage of the darkness of night, the terrorists fled the scene unchallenged. A police contingent reached the post and mounted a manhunt for the attackers after cordoning off the area.
The FIR of the deadly attack was registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department Kohat Division police station.
The funeral of the martyred cops was offered at the Police Lines which was attended by K-P IG Akhtar Hayat Khan, Kohat GOC Maj Gen Zulfiqar Bhatti, RPO Sher Akbar, Kohat Division Commissioner Abid Khan, DPO Farhan Khan and relatives of the martyrs.
The K-P IGP and officials of the local police, army and district administration presented a salute to the martyrs and laid a floral wreath on their coffins. Later, the bodies were dispatched to their ancestral villages for burial.

Speaking on the occasion, the K-P police chief said that such cowardly acts would not lower the morale of his force, noting that the police were performing their duty more vigorously to maintain peace in the province.
It was the third deadly attack on the police during the last three days. Two policemen escorting polio vaccinators were martyred while three others injured in a gunfight with terrorists in the Teri Ram area of Bannu district. On January 8, five policemen were martyred and 27 people were injured in a blast near a police van in Mamund tehsil of Bajaur district.
Meanwhile the military’s media wing said that security forces and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire in Lakki Marwat on Wednesday. Two terrorists were “sent to hell” during the exchange of fire as “own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”, reads the ISPR statement.
The dead terrorists have been identified as Aftab, alias Malang, and Masood Shah. “These terrorists remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces as well as target killings of innocent civilians. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from them,” the ISPR added.
According to the military statement, two soldiers identified as Sepoy Muhammad Afzal and Sepoy Ibrar Hussain embraced martyrdom during the intense exchange of fire.
“A sanitisation operation is being carried out to eliminate any terrorists found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it added.

2,‘Tainted’ SC judge doffs robe to ‘save face’,"Judge may now be entitled to pension, other privileges","Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi – who faces charges of misconduct – on Wednesday resigned as a judge of the Supreme Court, saying it was no longer possible for him to continue holding this position.
Justice Naqvi is accused of misconduct and  embroiled in ongoing proceedings at the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) in this connection.
A day earlier, the apex court turned down Justice Naqvi’s plea to halt the ongoing SJC misconduct proceedings against him.
Justice Naqvi tendered his resignation to President Dr Arif Alvi, in which he wrote that it was an honour for him to serve as the judge of the Lahore High Court and then the Supreme Court.
""In the circumstances which are a matter of public knowledge and to some extent public record, it is no longer possible for me to continue to serve as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,"" Justice Naqvi wrote in his resignation.
“Considerations of due process also compel. I, therefore, effective today resign as judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” he added.
Justice Naqvi may now be entitled to pension and other privileges after his resignation. If the SJC had removed him for misconduct, he would have lost these benefits.
Read: https://tribune.com.pk/story/2452706/naqvis-bid-to-halt-sjc-rejected
After the president accepts Justice Naqvi’s resignation, the posts of two judges at the top court will become vacant.
Interestingly, Justice Naqvi wrote the year 2023 in his resignation letter.
However, the error was rectified when the Aiwan-e-Sadr pointed it out.
In a letter sent to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and all SC judges in December, Justice Naqvi wrote that the treatment meted out to him by the SJC was “nothing short of disgraceful”.
Ten complaints accusing Justice Naqvi of misconduct were pending in the SJC.
In October last year, the SJC issued a show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi in connection with the complaints lodged against him and directed the judge to submit a reply within two weeks.
Headed by CJP Isa, the SJC includes Justice Tariq Masood, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, and Balochistan High Court CJ Naeem Akhtar.
In a preliminary reply submitted to the council in November, Justice Naqvi cited “serious prejudice” against him, demanding that CJP Isa, Justice Masood and CJ Akhtar should recuse themselves and not hear the matter.
On November 20, Justice Naqvi challenged the SJC proceedings against him and also contested the show-cause notice issued to him by the council, maintaining that the initiation of proceedings was coram non-judice and without lawful authority.
Later, the SJC issued a fresh show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi on November 22, directing him to file his reply within 14 days.
On December 4, Justice Naqvi again approached the top court and expressed his intent to pursue the constitutional petition he had moved earlier seeking to quash the revised show-cause notice issued by the SJC.

After a couple of days, Justice Naqvi drew the attention of the SC committee comprising three senior-most judges towards the silence over his petitions challenging the issuance of the show-cause notice despite the lapse of time as stipulated in the Supreme Court (Practice & Procedure) Act, 2023.
On December 15, the SJC in an open hearing gave two weeks to Justice Naqvi to respond to the misconduct allegations and directed him to submit a reply to the show-cause notice by January 1.
Later, the judge filed a detailed response to the show-cause notice, claiming that the allegations against him were “absolutely and maliciously false”.
He added that the SJC was not empowered to entertain any complaint against a judge and was only entitled to receiving “information”.
On January 8, Justice Naqvi withdrew his objection to the three-judge bench hearing his plea challenging the issuance of a show-cause notice to him.
On Tuesday, a three-member SC bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Musarrat Hilali dismissed Justice Naqvi's petition to halt the ongoing misconduct proceedings at the SJC.

3,SC upholds Musharraf's death penalty in treason case,SC annuls LHC’s 2020 decision declaring special court ‘unconstitutional’,"In a symbolic order, the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the death sentence handed down to the late former military ruler, Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf, by a special court in a high treason case.
A four-judge bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, and comprising Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Aminuddin Khan and Athar Minallah, took up appeals related to the Lahore High Court’s January 13, 2020 order.
The LHC in its order declared the special court, which handed down the death sentence to Musharraf on December 17, 2019, as “unconstitutional”.
The SC issued separate orders on the matter of the appeal against the death penalty decision and the petition filed against the LHC declaring the special court ‘illegal’.
In one of the orders, the SC dismissed the appeal under Section 431 of the Criminal Code because of the lack of appearance of the legal heirs of Musharraf.
It declared that as a result of the termination of the appeal, the death sentence handed down by the special court in the high treason case would remain upheld.
The court observed that the former general’s legal heirs could not be contacted despite making efforts.
According to the SC’s order, notices were given to Musharraf’s heirs regarding the court proceedings at both their local and international residential addresses. Advertisements were also released in Urdu and English newspapers.
The SC noted in its order that there were two questions before the court: whether or not an appeal could be heard after the person had passed away, and if the death penalty was upheld, would Musharraf's legal heirs be entitled to his benefits.
The decision further stated that despite several attempts, Musharraf's heirs could not be contacted. “We have no option but to retain the death penalty,” the order read.
In the other matter, the court issued a short order annulling the LHC decision to declare the special court as unconstitutional.
During the proceedings, Additional Attorney General Aamir Rehman told the court that the government opposed Musharraf's appeal.
Hamid Khan and Salman Safdar, the lawyers for Musharraf, appeared before the court.
Hamid asserted that the request before the SC aimed to overturn the LHC order was a ""constitutional matter” and his client’s ""criminal appeal"" should be considered separately.
Addressing Hamid, CJP Isa observed that he had completed his arguments in the constitutional matter and the court had to hear the criminal appeal.
“These are two separate matters and both have to be decided separately,” he added.
Safdar said in his arguments that there were no instructions from the former military ruler’s family.
He added that the family was aware of the case, further informing the court that they were contacted over 10 times since November last year.
“No instructions were given for, or against the case. Hence, I am not representing Pervez Musharraf's family,” he continued.
Justice Shah observed that the SC had also issued notices to Musharraf directly, to which Safdar added that the top court had also notified him through a newspaper advertisement.
“I can provide judicial assistance on two situations,” the lawyer said. To this, Justice Shah told Safdar that he could assist the court only on the legal situation.
Justice Aminuddin noted that the crucial question in this case was that Musharraf never surrendered himself before the court.
CJP Isa observed that that a way could be worked out for Musharraf not surrendering before the court as he was abroad and sick.
He continued that the real question was that none of his legal heirs appeared before the court either.
Justice Athar Minallah remarked that under Article 12, the court’s doors were open against everyone involved in imposing the emergency with Musharraf. To this, Safdar responded that the ex-military ruler was not involved in the act alone.
“The then prime minister, law minister, parliament and SC judges were also involved in it with him,” he said, adding that the special court sentenced Musharraf without hearing him.
“One man was singled out and punished for his actions against the whole country,” he argued.
Following this, the CJP called for taking a five-minute break, stating that the apex court wished to decide the case today.
As the hearing resumed, CJP Isa observed that the court could not hear the ex-military dictator’s lawyer in the absence of his legal heirs.
“Decisions should not be based on assumptions,” he observed, adding that the court did not want to close any door on the heirs.
“How can the court resort to the use of 561-A?” he questioned.
Appreciating the action taken by the SC, Safdar informed that Musharraf's heirs did not reside in Pakistan.
The CJP asked Safdar what his reservations were over the LHC.
To which the lawyer said that he does not even appear in the SC before the judge, who tried Musharraf in the LHC.
“I will definitely make some reports in your chamber about this,” Safdar said.  However, he was discouraged by the CJP, who pointed out that they did not call anyone in the chamber.

4,‘3rd umpire’ returns bat to Kaptaan just before match,PHC orders ECP to reinstate party’s cherished symbol," In a sigh of relief for the embattled Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday declared “illegal” the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to revoke the PTI’s ‘bat’ electoral symbol and reject its intra-party polls.
In the short order, the PHC said that the ECP order was “illegal, without any lawful authority and of no legal effect”.
The court instructed the ECP to publish the certificate submitted by PTI after its internal polls on the commission's website. Moreover, it affirmed PTI's entitlement to the election symbol in accordance with sections 215 and 217, along with other applicable provisions of the Election Act, 2017, and Election Rules, 2017.
The verdict was announced by a two-member bench, comprising Justice Ejaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali, in response to a joint petition filed by PTI Chairman Gohar Khan and six other leaders. The petition sought the court's intervention to invalidate the ECP's order, arguing it was illegal and beyond jurisdiction.
On December 22, the electoral watchdog invalidated PTI's internal elections, resulting in the withdrawal of the party's iconic ‘cricket bat’ symbol.
However, on December 26, the PHC, presided over by a single judge Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel, suspended the commission’s decision to nullify the PTI's intra-party polls and revoke its 'cricket bat' symbol.
The court in its order had directed the commission to publish the PTI’s certificate on its website and restore the electoral symbol of the party.
The ECP held a meeting following the PHC’s decision. The commission then decided to challenge the PHC decision through an intra-court appeal filed on December 30, 2023.
As the hearing commenced on Wednesday, Justice Anwar remarked that the 'ladla' (blue-eyed boy) title keeps switching from person to person.
Advocate Qazi Javed stated that his client and PTI’s former district general secretary came to know about the intra-party polls from the media, mentioning that Javed wanted to participate in the party polls; but was not given the opportunity.
Advocate Javed stated that he also approached the ECP in this regard. Upon Justice Anwar’s inquiry on whether all members or just provincial representatives were elected in the polls, Javed remarked that the representatives of the entire country were elected.
The counsel maintained that if PTI is demanding a level playing field, then it should provide the same to its party workers as well.
The lawyer for petitioner Jahangir from Charsadda, Naveed Akhtar, stated that his client was the PTI's district president and was dismissed from the party over a statement. Naveed claimed that PTI did not elect officials as per the constitution, maintaining that every party should abide by its constitution.
Justice Ali inquired whether there could be a penalty for intra-party elections or was any action taken by the electoral watchdog, to which the lawyer replied that no action was taken by the election commission.
The counsel for the complainant argued that the ECP should have ensured that the intra-party polls were held under Section 208.
PTI lawyer Barrister Ali Zafar, while presenting his arguments, said he wanted to clarify the principle of jurisdiction in the case. He said that under Article 199, the PHC is empowered to hear the party's plea as the intra-polls were held in Peshawar - which falls under the jurisdiction of the PHC.
He further said that the party's chairman also belongs to K-P and when asked about the general secretary, he replied it is Umar Ayub.
Justice Anwar remarked that if the intra-party election was against the constitution, ECP neither issued the party a show-cause notice nor any punishment and added that the election body only nullified PTI's intra-party polls.

In a related development, the PTI retracted its application for the allotment of its election symbol from the Supreme Court, following which the apex court dismissed the application on withdrawal grounds.
In a hearing presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar stepped forward, expressing the intent to withdraw the application.
ECP meeting
Meanwhile, the ECP has called an important meeting in the wake of the PHC’s ruling. Scheduled to take place today morning at the ECP Secretariat, the meeting will be presided over by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja. Alongside the CEC, the session will include the participation of the four members of the ECP and special secretaries.
The primary agenda of the meeting will be a comprehensive discussion on the Peshawar High Court's decision regarding the allotment of election symbol to the PTI. The ECP will provide a detailed briefing to its law wing, focusing particularly on the legal aspects pertinent to the judgment

5,Justice Ahsan baffled at SJC’s ‘haste’,Calls for recalling second show cause issued to Justice Naqvi," 
Supreme Court senior judge Ijazul Ahsan has raised concerns about the manner in which the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is conducting proceedings on complaints filed against another SC judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi. Justice Ahsan, who is also a part of the five-member SJC, has called for the withdrawal of the show cause notice issued to Justice Naqvi on November 22.
The judge on Tuesday issued his 4-page opinion highlighting the reasons why he disagreed with the majority verdict to issue show cause notices to Naqvi. ""Before I set out my reasons, I wish to say something about the manner in which these [SJC] proceedings are being conducted. Unfortunately, in my opinion, proceedings are being conducted in undue haste contrary to established norms,"" he said.
According to the judge, the council, entrusted as it is with enormous constitutional responsibilities under Article 209 of the Constitution, is a body that must act with deliberate care and after full, frank and detailed discussion. “This is especially so where there is no unanimity and some members (or even one member) are inclined to disagree with [the] majority. This approach has been entirely lacking in the present proceedings. Debate and discussion has been non-existent and has not been permitted.""
Read SC dismisses plea to stay SJC proceeding against Justice Naqvi
Justice Ahsan said the SJC proceedings on November 22, 2023, when it issued the second notice to Justice Naqvi, were completely devoid of any discussion or deliberation whatsoever. This manner of proceedings, he said, has cast an unwelcome doubt over the whole process. “I, therefore, disagree with the process followed and the manner in which the proceedings are being conducted,"" he added.
Justice Ahsan described the allegation levelled against Justice Naqvi as being utterly without merit or substance, both in law and even on a prima facie appraisal of the facts. He said most of the allegations relate to various properties and alleged transactions in relation to the same and pointed the finger at Justice Naqvi’s sons.
""The sons are lawyers in practice and are persons of independent means. They are effectively being condemned unheard. This, and the allegations themselves, are directly contrary to the findings recorded in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa and others v President of Pakistan and others case.”

He said reference may be made to the ""obligation of a Judge as to the knowledge of financial matters of his or her financially independent family members"". ""The same is true for allegation No 10, which again implicates the sons of the respondent judge [Naqvi]. As a matter of law, these allegations are unsustainable and cannot be leveled against the judge.’
He noted that allegation No 1 is that the respondent judge is “approachable”, adding that it is a highly noxious claim based entirely on some leaked audio conversations or judicial orders. “The law in respect of both is well settled. No judicial order can be the basis for proceedings under Article 209. This is settled beyond doubt,” he added.
Referring to the SJC’s October 27 proceedings when the council issued its first show cause to Justice Naqvi, he said on that day around twenty complaints were dismissed as they were about judicial orders of various judges. He said the law is equally well settled as regards the use of audio or video clips in any proceedings.
“The making of this allegation, and its inclusion in the show cause notice, [is] in clear violation of settled law. The instant show cause notice [should] never have been issued. It should be recalled forthwith,"" he said.
