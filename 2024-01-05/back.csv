1,No signal from ‘any quarter’ to postpone elections: Solangi,"Only ECP had the constitutional authority to postpone polls, says info minister","Caretaker Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi on Friday said that the government had received no signal from “any quarter” to postpone the general election, scheduled to be held on February 8.
The statement came after the Senate passed a resolution seeking a delay in elections citing security concerns. The resolution, presented by independent Senator Dilawar Khan, was opposed by Solangi and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Afnan Ullah Khan.
The upper house of parliament has a total of 100 members, out of which a mere 14 were present during today’s session. “So far, no signal has been received from any quarter regarding postponement of elections,” he said while talking to the media outside the Parliament House in Islamabad.

Only the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), he said, had the constitutional authority to postpone the elections. “According to Article 218(3) of the Constitution, it was the power of the ECP, to conduct elections, give a date or change the date for elections,” he said. “We cannot interfere in the affairs of a constitutional body.”
The minister lamented that he did not get a chance to give arguments in the resolution on the postponement of the elections in the upper house.
Acknowledging the problems mentioned in the resolution as genuine, Solangi, however, stated that these had existed in the past as well.
The minister maintained that it was the government’s responsibility to look into the issues of harsh weather and other matters including law and order.

2,"LHC seeks PEMRA, ECP’s replies on election survey ban",Justice Najafi expresses bewilderment over ban; summons officials concerned on January 9,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) sought replies on Friday from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) by January 9 on a plea challenging the latter’s ban on airing election surveys on television channels.
Petitioner, journalist Muneer Ahmad Bajwa, filed the plea through advocate Mian Dawood. The plea seeks to set aside PEMRA’s notification through which the ban was imposed.
The petitioner also prayed to court to declare clause 12 of the Code of Conduct (COC) for National Media, issued by the ECP, ultra vires and unconstitutional.
As proceedings commenced, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi expressed bewilderment regarding the ban. Election surveys are conducted and discussed across the world, he said.
During the proceedings, Justice Najafi on summoning the ECP’s lawyer was informed that he was busy at another court regarding matters relating to nomination papers.
The court was requested to adjourn the case. At this, Justice Najafi adjourned the case till January 9.
Advocate Dawood told the court that this was the first time that such a ban had been imposed through the introduction of clause 12 of a media code of conduct. He said the ban needs to be strongly condemned, arguing that it was tantamount to depriving the public of their independent opinion.
The ECP first issued the code of conduct, and then wrote to PEMRA to restrain television channels from airing election surveys. Following the ECP’s directives, the media regulatory authority issued a notification banning all coverage of election surveys on television channels.
He contended to the court that “the freedom of press and speech was a fundamental right of the people of Pakistan, which cannot be curtailed or limited by state functionaries using any technical, non-technical, ambiguous, unambiguous or any other circulars, rules and even through law as interpreted in PLD 2016 SC 692. It is constitutional duty of the judiciary to enforce the fundamental rights whenever pointed out through public interest litigation”.
“Free and fair journalism was the core and heart of democracy, because the right to information is now being recognized as an inalienable right all over the world, most specifically of the citizens of Pakistan,” the petition maintains.
It further adds that, “The political parties have a legitimate right to run their campaigns through various channels, including social media. Restricting the ability of media outlets and influencers to engage in polling-related activities may inadvertently impede the free flow of information that is crucial for an informed electorate during an election period.”
The petitioner made the ECP and PEMRA respondents through their chairmen, and the federal government through secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

Justice Waqar Ahmed, presiding over the case, considered the petitions opposing the inclusion of PTI's former assembly members in the fourth schedule. Dismissing the petitions, Justice Ahmed also sought a response for the next hearing.
Additionally, the court issued an order restraining the provincial government from initiating any action against the applicants.
An individual is placed in the fourth schedule under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 when there is credible intelligence-information against him of being linked to a proscribed organisation. The person is then subjected to restrictions on travel, speech and business.
During the proceedings, Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah, the lawyer representing the petitioner, presented arguments and evidence supporting the contention that the recommendation to include former assembly members in the fourth schedule had been formally made. He stated that the petitioner himself is a former assembly member and a victim of terrorism.
Attorney General Daniyal Chaudhry apprised the court that the district anti-terrorism coordination committee had recommended the inclusion of these names in the schedule, yet the actual inclusion had not taken place.
Subsequently, the court, while preventing the provincial government from taking any action against the petitioners, ordered the provincial government to submit a response by January 23.
The list of individuals recommended for inclusion in the fourth schedule includes former Speaker Asad Qaiser, along with former members Amjad Ali, Gul Zafar, Iftikhar Mashwani, Mian Sharifat Ali, Abdul Salam, Zaher Shah, Fazal Hakim, and others.

As a result of the protest, the PML-N government had to sack its law minister Zahid Hamid. The Supreme Court had taken suo motu notice of the sit-in on Nov 21, 2017.
While giving his statement, Faiz answered the questions given by the commission, in which he said that he had negotiated with the TLP on the instructions of the government.
Faiz denied the allegations of conspiracy against the government.

Among the agenda items ranging from economy to defense and internal security to agriculture, the party has presented its vision for the future and outlined reforms that it intends to bring in different sectors.
The MQM-P says it will make the anti-corruption laws stricter by introducing capital punishment for mega corruption. Advocating for implementing an educational emergency for five to 10 years, it promises a one-time meal to mothers bringing their child to school and a one-time glass of milk for children who attend school.
“Our manifesto is aligned with our national agenda and whether we sit in opposition or join any coalition we will strive to implement [it],” the party says. It says flaws and deficiencies in the present Constitution and the obsolete political and administrative setup have made Pakistan a “feudocracy” instead of true participatory democracy.

“We believe a new social contract is the need of the hour to make the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan closer to the will of the people,” it reads. Effective policies, collaboration, and investments in education are crucial for realizing the vision of $100 billion remittances, making Pakistan's mark on the global stage, it adds.
The party proposes a practical formula to free Pakistan from the clutches of the IMF and the World Bank by earning $100 billion foreign exchange utilizing the youth bulge. The manifesto states that the party would go for introducing agriculture tax on income no less than Rs4.8 million and no more than 200 acres of land through a necessary constitutional amendment.
Under urban development, the MQM-P proposes to curtail the rapid degradation and deterioration of life in existing cities and urban centers of Pakistan. “The MQM-P commits to build 100 new cities, including clusters of satellite cities, most of which with specialized industrialized zones.”
Also, the MQM-P commits to gradually increase the representation of women to 50% particularly in the parliament, provincial assemblies, local governments, governments, and semi-government offices. The party says it will ensure that essential reproductive health services including family planning services are affordable and readily available to all citizens of the country, saying there was a need to create a balance between population size and available resources.

The manifesto states that 2% of the GDP will be allocated to reach out to the citizens who need social security, saying the concept of the BISP shall be revised and will be changed into the BIGP—Benazir Income Generation Programme—in order to protect the self-esteem of people.
The MQMP manifesto states that it intends to repatriate all stranded Pakistanis from Mashriqi Pakistan (Bangladesh). The MQM-P intends to target 8% forest cover in 5 years and maintain international standards and allocation of land for forests. The MQM-P also proposes abolishing the prevailing “medieval feudal system” from the country.
It says that the national water accord will be reviewed to ensure and rationalize just water distribution among provinces, adding that 650 mgd/day additional water will be supplied to Karachi through K-4 project. Under the defense chapter, it says that strong intelligence services are critical for national defense and, therefore, investment will be made in artificial intelligence (AI), human and signals intelligence to preempt threats and secure its interests.
