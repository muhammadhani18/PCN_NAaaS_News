0,Telecom appellate tribunal set up,Govt aims to swiftly address legal disputes in telecommunication sector,"In a groundbreaking move, the government of Pakistan has taken a decisive step by instituting the Telecommunication Appellate Tribunal, aimed at swiftly addressing and settling disputes within the telecom sector. Responding to the persistent calls from IT, telecom, and internet service providers, the government strategically enacted the Telecommunication Appellate Tribunal Ordinance of 2023 demonstrates to enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of the industry.
This newly established Tribunal joins the ranks of specialised entities, mirroring its counterpart handling disputes in the power distribution sector. The caretaker government, recognising the urgent need for a dedicated institution, has formally enacted the Telecommunication Appellate Tribunal Ordinance of 2023, marking a milestone in the evolution of the country's telecommunications landscape. The official gazette notification outlines key details of the Tribunal, which will be composed of three members, including the chairperson. The chairperson's qualifications are outlined precisely – they must either be a Judge of a High Court or an advocate with a substantial 15 years of experience in the field. Notably, all ongoing appeals and cases related to the IT and telecom sector within the purview of High Courts will be swiftly transferred to the Telecommunication Appellate Tribunal within a month, as articulated in the gazette.

Appeals against the decisions made by the Tribunal can be filed at the Supreme Court within a sixty-day timeframe. While the appointment of the chairperson and members awaits the formalities of the incoming government, expected to be elected on February 8, the legal framework has set a clear path. The law mandates a four-year term for the chairperson and members, with provisions for reappointment. Their service concludes either at the age of sixty-eight or upon the expiry of the term, unless renewed.
The intricacies of remuneration are carefully defined in the ordinance. If the chairperson is a retired Judge of a High Court, their entitlements will reflect the last salary, perks, and privileges drawn in that role. Conversely, if an advocate assumes the role of chairperson, their entitlements align with the salary, perks, and privileges of MP-I scale within the federal government structure.
The composition of the Tribunal emphasises the importance of expertise. One of the members must possess a master's level professional degree in fields such as electrical engineering, electronics, telecommunications, information and communication technology, or information security. The other member should have a similar level of professional qualification in finance, commerce, economics, chartered accountancy, or a related subject. Both members are entitled to the salary, perks, and privileges of the MP-I scale, underscoring the significance of their role in ensuring fair and informed decisions within the telecom sector.

Caretaker IT Minister Dr Umar Saif, a key figure in driving this initiative, highlighted that the Telecom Tribunal will operate under the Presidential Ordinance in the absence of Parliament. Saif acknowledged that the establishment of the Tribunal fulfills a longstanding demand of the Telecom sector, providing a dedicated platform for the expeditious resolution of cases.
Saif further explained that the Ministry of Law will play a pivotal role in nominating the chairperson and members of the tribunal, ensuring a transparent and accountable selection process. Moreover, the Tribunal will include two-member technocrats, their numbers subject to adjustment based on evolving needs and circumstances.
One of the most noteworthy features of the Telecom Tribunal is its commitment to deciding on approved appeals from telecom operators against the decisions of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) within a stringent 90-day timeframe, said the minister. This represents a paradigm shift from the historical practice of approaching the High Court for operational or service disputes between PTAs and telecom operators, a process known for unnecessary delays.
This newly established tribunal addresses historical inefficiencies and sets a precedent for efficient conflict resolution. By providing a dedicated and expert forum for dispute resolution, the Telecom Tribunal is poised to play a crucial role in ensuring the continued growth and stability of the telecom industry, fostering an environment conducive to innovation and investment. As the sector continues to evolve, the significance of such dedicated institutions becomes increasingly evident, positioning Pakistan as a forward-thinking player in the global telecommunications landscape.

1,Govt plans to sow lentils for self-sufficiency,"Cultivate pulses across 874,000 hectares this Rabi season","The government's ambitious goal to cultivate pulses across 874,000 hectares this Rabi season marks a strategic move to bolster domestic self-sufficiency and protect vital foreign exchange reserves. A high-ranking official from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research disclosed the comprehensive plan, highlighting the cultivation of gram pulses on 860,000 hectares and lentils on 14,000 hectares.

To achieve these targets, the production goals for gram and lentil varieties have been set at an impressive 419,000 tonnes. Punjab takes the lead, aiming to cultivate gram pulses on 786,000 hectares with an expected yield of 322,000 tonnes. Sindh contributes 22,000 hectares to the gram pulse initiative, anticipating a substantial 23,000-tonne yield.
Simultaneously, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces are set to cultivate gram pulses on 30,000 and 40,000 hectares, projecting yields of 15,000 tonnes and 49,000 tonnes, respectively.

2,Global firms allowed to launch satellite services,Private sector will give 6% of income to govt’s R&D Fund,"The caretaker government has approved the National Space Policy to allow private-sector companies to use low-orbit satellites in the space to start satellite communication services for people.
The government has estimated an annual economic loss of $40 million to the country owing to the unregulated space sector where 70% of resources remain unutilised. Starlink may be the first company to launch low-orbit satellite services for satellite communications, which has already a network of 3,000 to 4,000 low-orbit satellites in the space.
Talking to a select group of journalists on Thursday, Caretaker Information Technology and Telecommunication Minister Umar Saif said that all international companies would be allowed to launch satellite communication services in Pakistan after obtaining a no-objection certificate from the Ministry of Defence.
To promote the initiative, the private sector will give 6% of its income to the Research and Development (R&D) Fund of the government.
The minister said that Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) would issue licences to the interested private parties for satellite communication services.
He added that Pakistanis, especially those living in remote areas where no fibre cable network was available, would be able to use low-orbit satellite services for communications. “The cabinet has already approved the policy.”
According to sources, the cabinet was briefed in a recent meeting that the National Space Policy was vital to fully exploit the space potential as the policy would provide the requisite framework for responsible and profitable space activities, promote economic sustainability and enhance the country’s global standing.
The cabinet was informed that Pakistan had no such policy, which adversely impacted the development of its space sector. Also, owing to the unregulated space sector, 70% of resources remained unutilised, leading to estimated economic losses of $40 million annually.

The cabinet was told that for the space sector, Pakistan lacked a clear strategic direction, commercialisation guidelines and mechanisms for public-private partnerships and joint ventures. As a result, national projects were heavily reliant on foreign loans, placing a substantial burden on the national exchequer.
It was highlighted that the National Space Policy had been diligently and meticulously devised to establish a comprehensive guiding framework after consultations with all key stakeholders, including the Ministry of IT, PTA, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) and the Frequency Allocation Board (FAB).
A cabinet member pointed out that the policy envisaged gaining maximum benefits from space technology and applications, covering the entire spectrum of space activities, including civil and commercial use as well as national security.
He explained that during the course of formulating the policy, certain issues had cropped up that needed well-informed solutions and the way forward.
Concerns were expressed regarding the ambit of Suparco and how to protect its interest. In response, it was clarified that the policy stipulated that the private sector would give a percentage of its income to the R&D Fund of the government.
Another cabinet member emphasised that “since space is a sensitive matter, permissions need to be taken from all the players and entities involved”.
A member was of the view that as a matter of policy, the same entity should not be both a regulator as well as service provider, as it constituted a conflict of interest.
The cabinet expressed satisfaction with the arrangement of the policy and approved the proposal with due consideration.

3,Forex reserves spike to over 5-month high,SBP’s reserves grow after arrival of funding from multilateral lenders,"Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, held by the central bank, have surprisingly increased for the second consecutive week, hitting a five-and-a-half-month high at $8.22 billion, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
Foreign currency reserves have cumulatively risen by $1.32 billion in two weeks, which reflects a rebound from almost six-month low of $6.90 billion hit on December 15, 2023.
The reserves grew on the back of official inflows coming from multilateral creditors. This helped the country to meet the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) end-December quarterly target of net foreign assets (NFA), according to industry sources and local research houses.
In addition, the official inflows improved the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt repayments with no chances of debt default, contrary to the threat of missing necessary payments in the recent past.
The back-to-back multilateral funding at this point in time surprised financial markets globally as well as locally as experts had expected such receipts post-IMF board’s approval of the release of second loan tranche of $700 million. The IMF board is scheduled to meet on January 11. The foreign assistance came from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The IMF expects Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves to reach $9 billion by the end of June 2024. Its new country report is expected to be released after the board meeting where revised numbers may be provided. Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail said on social media platform X “due to multilateral dollar inflows after the IMF staff approval, Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have reached a 23-week high. In just one month, the reserves have increased by $1.2 billion to $8.2 billion in spite of regular debt repayments.”

It would definitely help meet the IMF’s December quarter NFA target, he added.
The central bank said in its weekly update on Thursday that its foreign exchange reserves rose by $464 million in the week ended on December 29, 2023 to $8.22 billion. On the other hand, the reserves held by commercial banks slipped below the $5 billion mark for the first time in over three months. Total liquid foreign exchange reserves of the country, however, rose to $13.22 billion by December 29, 2023.
Earlier, the ADB inked an agreement to provide financing of $1.2 billion to Pakistan. Similarly, the World Bank approved a loan of $350 million to strengthen food security and improve the education system.
To recall, the SBP’s reserves hit a nine-year low below $3 billion in February 2023, which were barely enough for one month of imports. China came forward for Pakistan’s rescue by extending new financing to help avert the risk of default while other global creditors waited for the IMF to revive its loan programme before unlocking their financing.
In late June 2023, Pakistan eventually got a new lifeline of $3 billion from the IMF. Its first loan tranche of $1.2 billion and fresh deposits from Saudi Arabia and the UAE of $3 billion helped shore up the SBP’s reserves to $8.73 billion in mid-July 2023 from $4.53 billion in the first week of July.

4,Rupee continues upward trajectory,"According to SBP data, domestic currency strengthened by 0.02%, or Rs0.05, closing at Rs281.67 against greenback","The Pakistani currency continued its upward trajectory, reaching a two-month high at slightly over Rs281.50 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Thursday. This marks the second successive working day of gains, supported by the government's commitment to crack down on currency smugglers and hoarders.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, the domestic currency strengthened by 0.02%, or Rs0.05, closing at Rs281.67 against the greenback. Over the past five weeks, the currency has cumulatively gained 1.40%, amounting to Rs3.97.
However, the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported a 0.04% drop, or Rs0.11, closing at Rs282.53/$ in the open market. Market discussions suggest that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has reiterated its commitment to taking action against smugglers and hoarders, contributing to an increased supply of foreign currency in the domestic economy.
Read Rupee hits over two-month high against dollar
The rupee is anticipated to maintain its winning streak leading up to the International Monetary Fund’s Executive Board meeting scheduled for January 11, where approval for the next loan tranches of $700 million for Pakistan is expected. Pakistan secured an IMF staff-level agreement in mid-November during the first review of the ongoing $3 billion loan programme, and approval of the loan tranche could unlock an additional $1.5-2 billion financing from multilateral and bilateral lenders.
Recent financial support from a global institution has bolstered Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves by $852 million to $7.75 billion, contributing to the strengthening of the rupee.

5,Stocks end flat over continuous volatility,"KSE-100 index edges down 7.69 points, settles at 64,639.16","Volatile trading continued at the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Thursday as the KSE-100 index swung between positive and negative territories during which investors looked for cues to set direction of the market.
There was an absence of positive triggers that significantly impacted investors’ interest in building their positions, leading to a flat close for the index.
In the morning, the market commenced trading on a positive note when it touched the intra-day high at 64,936.75 points.
However, soon volatility gripped the bourse, prompting selling in stocks of banks, exploration and production companies, and steel producers for profit-booking. Resultantly, the index touched its intra-day low at 64,098.10 points.
After midday, the market recovered, aided by investor buying in fertiliser and refinery sectors, but it failed to surpass the 65,000-point mark and the day closed on a flat note.
“Stocks closed flat amid concerns about National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) approval of a hike in industrial power tariff and high inflation reported for December 2023,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Economic risks due to an uncertain fate of reforms post-elections, the circular debt crisis and pre-poll uncertainty played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a marginal decrease of 7.69 points, or 0.01%, and settled at 64,639.16.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its market review, stated that “resistance continued at 65,000 with indices closing marginally down for the day”.
A break of the narrow range between 64,200 and 65,200 points would determine if 63,000 would be revisited before moving higher or if support had risen to 64,000, it said.

“A sustained move above 65,000 should see the market move quickly to 67,000,” the AHL report added.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said that the stock market rebounded from an intra-day low of 64,098 and finally closed at 64,639, down eight points day-on-day.
The auto sector led the recovery where Honda Atlas Cars (Pakistan), Pak Suzuki Motor Company and Sazgar Engineering Works closed at their respective upper circuits, he said.
In addition, fertiliser and refinery sectors also posted gains. However, banks, exploration and production, and steel sectors saw profit-taking.
“Going forward, news on the political front will set direction of the market,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 548.99 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 639.6 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs15.4 billion.
Shares of 360 companies were traded. Of these, 155 stocks closed higher, 184 dropped and 21 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 154.7 million shares, gaining Rs0.18 to close at Rs5.65. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 37.1 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs1.48 and Fauji Foods with 27.3 million shares, losing Rs0.22 to close at Rs10.74.
Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs9.9 million, according to the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL).

6,Copper exports to China cross $1b,Shipments likely to rise further owing to production of refined products,"Pakistan’s exports of copper and articles made from the metal to China have increased in recent years and in the first 11 months of 2023 rose 9%, crossing the $1 billion mark, according to officials.
Pakistan Embassy Commercial Counsellor in Beijing Ghulam Qadir told the China Economic Net (CEN) that Pakistan’s government was keen to boost copper and associated product exports to China.
He pointed out that exports of copper had increased and anticipated that the value of shipments would rise further owing to the production and demand for refined copper products.
“Pakistan has been actively seeking foreign investment, particularly from big Chinese companies, to make value addition and produce more valuable products for the global market,” the counsellor said.

Investment from Chinese companies in Pakistan will not only provide a boost to the economy but also open doors for advanced technologies and expertise. “This will enable Pakistan to enhance its manufacturing capabilities and produce high-quality, value-added products that can meet international standards,” he added.
Qadir said that the Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC), one of the major players in the Chinese copper industry, was active in Pakistan and was crucial for the Saindak copper mining project, which was started in 1995.
Pakistani copper exporter Awais Mir, who is the Chairman of DEA group, told CEN that it was due to increased investment by Chinese companies with local Pakistani firms and higher demand for copper products in China after Covid-19.
“This trend is likely to continue as both countries are expected to benefit from deepening economic cooperation,” he said.

7,Analysts urge politicians to draw up economic stability plans,Say upcoming govt should resolve energy crisis by supplying affordable electricity and gas,"Analysts and market pundits have described 2024 as the most volatile year locally and globally because of elections, energy crises, tough conditionalities of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, and the lack of clear directions from the upcoming government to address prevailing challenges.
They said all local mainstream political parties contesting the general elections in the country in February should provide their economic stability plans to avert further losses and delays. They also warned that numerous global issues are impacting world economies.
Talking to The Express Tribune, they said the upcoming government should prioritise resolving the energy crisis by providing sufficient and affordable electricity and gas to industries. The import bill should be reduced by imposing bans on luxury products. They highlighted controlling inflation to ensure affordable living costs for the masses and containing the cost of production for businesses at a local level. They pleaded for formulating economic plans aimed at reviving growth in large-scale manufacturing, small and medium-sized segments, the service sector, and exports.
“2024 is the most volatile year in both local and global scenarios. This is not business as usual this time [2024], although some stability and macro-economic situation augur well. Local challenges include energy crises, high taxes, higher interest rates, ballooning loans that have dented new investor confidence. Global issues consist of conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Hamas and Israel, and tension between Taiwan and China, US and China. They [global problems] could bring about a recession. Above all, general elections are being held in more than 40 countries worldwide,” said analyst and Alpha Beta Core CEO Khurram Schehzad.
“New political parties call for a fully-fledged and sound plan with a highly competent team to handle local challenges forthwith, but unfortunately, they have no solid plans or directions. Whether there is a majority or coalition government, it will have to work on a comprehensive plan that can restructure and convert the new IMF programme to economic stability. The IMF does not seem to give a big programme so easily in the future,” he said.

2023 could be divided into two parts, as a tough time was witnessed until June when there was no IMF programme, and the country was near default. Then the IMF programme came, the caretaker setup took over, and the first review of the IMF went better, he said, adding that the second review of the IMF on track would be good. He said when it comes to the second half of 2023, it has brought macro-wise stability relatively.
Syed Raza Hussain, an industrialist and President of the Federal B Area Trade and Association (FBATI), foresees a new year full of challenges for businesses and industries in Pakistan due to political uncertainty on global and local fronts.
“Although 2024 is considered the year for general elections, fears are looming for a possible political crisis in the country. In this situation, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) must play its role in building confidence in the investment climate to maintain the economic stability of the country in the next few years.
The incumbent government should come up with drastic measures to give confidence to local industrialists-cum-entrepreneurs and foreign investors through industry-friendly and investment-friendly policies. In this regard, the interest rate should be gradually reduced by 50% to 11% to boost economic activity and industrialisation within the country,” he said.
He said on the global front, the tense situation between Palestine and Israel can continue to destabilise the geopolitical and geo-economic situation, particularly through an upsurge in crude oil prices.
2024 is also called election year as approximately 60 countries including Pakistan, India, Iran, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, USA, UK, Russia, Ukraine, many European countries will hold general elections.

8,Oil drops 2% on US stock build,"Low fuel demand, large inventory increases in data from the US Energy Information Administration weighed on prices","Oil prices fell 2% on Thursday, largely unwinding an earlier rally, as massive weekly gasoline and distillate stock builds overshadowed a larger-than-expected crude stock draw.
Brent crude fell by $1.57, or 2%, to $79.01 a barrel by 11:23 am EDT, after earlier rising over $1. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $1.47, or 2%, to $73.57.
Low fuel demand and large inventory increases in data from the US Energy Information Administration weighed on prices.

Gasoline stocks rose by 10.9 million barrels to 237 million barrels, their highest week-on-week rise in more than 30 years.
Distillate stocks rose last week by 10.1 million barrels to 125.9 million barrels. Distillate product supplied, a proxy for demand, fell to its lowest level since 1999.
While crude inventories drew by 5.5 million barrels, much of that reflects shipping disruptions, said Bob Yawger, Director of Energy Futures at Mizuho.

9,Rs150b needed for better services,Planning Commission comes up with estimate to improve governance,"In order to improve Pakistan’s governance indicators, the Planning Commission has estimated that Rs150 billion will be required under the new five-year economic plan for better service delivery and beating the South Asian nations.
The draft of an official plan underlined that the lack of accountability and transparency at all levels of the state apparatus, particularly in areas directly dealing with the public, was contributing to bad governance.
The draft of the new Five-Year Economic Plan 2024-29 stated that in order to accomplish the reform agenda, investments had to be made in areas relating to innovation, capacity building, performance management, service delivery, justice sector, police, research and reforms in the public sector including the regulatory framework and statistics sector. Jehanzeb Khan heads the Planning Commission.
However, the draft chapter on governance and institutional reforms admitted that during the past 10 years, the country had spent Rs92 billion on improving governance indicators but they worsened compared to the regional countries.
Pakistan had shelved long-term central planning but again started working on the five-year plan after recommendations made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF last year provided a report on the Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) and Climate PIMA, advising to revive the central five-year planning.
The Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on Thursday approved a position paper about the IMF’s recommendations and decided to send it to Pakistan’s highest economic decision-making body – the National Economic Council (NEC) – for approval.
The draft plan stated that a successful implementation of new initiatives for improving governance indicators to levels better than the South Asian countries during the 13th Plan period 2024-29 would need Rs150 billion.
The Planning Commission has recommended making the third tier of governance – local governments – effective and efficient. It has also suggested implementing the 18th Constitutional Amendment in its true spirit by developing and stabilising efficient, sustainable, and decentralised governance systems at all levels to foster markets, opportunity, and community building.
The draft report stated that during the five-year plan period, the local government system would be strengthened by fostering inclusive governance, empowering communities, and ensuring efficient service delivery at the grassroots level.
The Planning Commission also recommended minimising the influence of members of national and provincial assemblies on local bodies aimed at making them more effective and answerable to the people. It also sought the institutionalisation of the Provincial Finance Commission on the same footing as the National Finance Commission aimed at transferring resources to the local bodies.
Since 2010, the federal and provincial governments have deliberately weakened local governments to keep a tight grip on the last tiers.
Under the five-year plan, it has been proposed to make the Provincial Finance Commission mechanism incentive based and encourage competition among constituencies by diverting focus from need-based resource allocation to incentive-based allocation.

It has been proposed to give matching grants to local governments to enhance efficiency rather than dependency.
Measures have also been proposed to improve service delivery by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), police, judiciary, State Bank of Pakistan, National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), and Competition Commission of Pakistan to name a few.
It is recommended that the FBR should initiate measures for the creation of a central database of potential taxpayers by obtaining data from NADRA, telecom companies, banking companies, educational institutions and development authorities.
It is also suggested that for ensuring transparency, there is a need to strengthen the Integrity Management Unit of the FBR, end-to-end automation, and provision of high-quality tax facilitation services while strengthening the FBR, provincial tax departments and revenue authorities.
Efforts should be made towards public sector capacity building to develop skilled, accessible, and motivated civil service responsive to the evolving socio-economic needs. Induction of professionals into relevant cadres and groups with a review of training regime based on a comprehensive training needs assessment is proposed.
It is also proposed that in order to attract and retain top talent, remuneration of public servants should be aligned with market-based salaries, and performance management system should be strengthened at both the departmental and individual levels to foster accountability.
Training of parliamentarians has been proposed to improve their leadership skills.
The draft report has identified corruption as a major challenge to improving service delivery. The major challenge for improved governance in the public sector includes minimising systematic corruption, which has been widely institutionalised in all sectors of the economy, it added.
It is proposed that efforts should be directed towards strengthening accountability institutions such as NAB, the Auditor General Office, FIA, and other federal and provincial entities by enhancing their capacity through training and granting financial and administrative autonomy.
During the next five years, it is proposed to strengthen the rule of law by enhancing effectiveness of the legal and judicial system with timely dispensation of justice. It is also recommended that citizen participation should be encouraged by promoting transparency and accountability in governance processes.
