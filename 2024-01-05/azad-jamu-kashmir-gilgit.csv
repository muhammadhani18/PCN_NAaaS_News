“The tantalising aroma of trout and carp fish besides other varieties and chappli kabab has always attracted me to enjoy its delectable taste at Qissa Khawani bazaar.

Sajid Ali, a fish outlet owner at Ghanta Ghar said trout stock has been brought from Swat and Mansehra districts as a special winter offer to fulfil Peshawarties’ pressing demands. “The recipe for trout fish is very simple and time-efficient.

Wapda’s retired employee, Qaiser Khan while eating fish at Ring Road Peshawar along with friends said trout was his favourite seafood as its meat was full of proteins and vitamins besides easily digestible. “When I was young, I visited Swat with my father during winter to enjoy the freshwater brown trout due to its aromatic taste and spiciness amid snowfall. This winter, I did not go to Swat due to the availability of grilled and baked trout fish at Peshawar.”
Dr Riaz Khan, senior children specialist at Government Hospital Pabbi Nowshera said there was an additional burden on the heart, brains, joints and lungs of weak people and children due to persistent cough, nausea and frosts in winter, adding consumption of fish was the best available choice to help reduce risks of these diseases.
Besides the best source of proteins, vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, phosphorus, iron and iodine, he said that consumption of seafood helps improve digestion, protects skin from dryness and relieves joints’ pains.
He said Pakistan can earn substantial revenue by giving special incentives to trout farmers besides the construction of new trout lakes especially in Malakand and Hazara divisions due availability of plenty of cold water reservoirs.

6,RDA threatens action against private schools,Orders owners to move out of residential areas,"The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has threatened to shut down private schools and colleges that are established in residential areas if the institutions’ buildings are not regularised within 15 days.
The three-year period given by the Supreme Court for the transfer of 8,500 private schools and colleges from residential areas of 44 Cantonment Boards across the country, including 229 private schools and colleges of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board had already ended.
The order was issued by the Supreme Court at the request of private school and college students’ parents.
According to cantonment authorities, the tranquillity of residential areas is being destroyed by the presence of private educational institutions. Problems of cleanliness, traffic, pollution and security have intensified due to the activity of private educational institutions in residential areas.

For this reason, the Supreme Court had given a three-year deadline, starting from 2019 to December 2021, during which private schools and colleges were expected to move out of the residential areas of the cantonment board areas across the country.
In a new development, the RDA has decided to issue the educational institutions an extension till the next academic year, which will start in March.
In response to RDA's legal action against illegal educational institutions, the Land Use and Building Control Wing RDA has decided to give an extension to these school owners until the current academic year so that the educational activities of the children can continue without any hindrance.
The RDA has said, “In light of this decision, all school owners who have established schools in residential buildings without approval have been directed by RDA DG to immediately regularise the school as per the law or otherwise stop illegal use of these buildings.” The schools are expected to submit an affidavit, which states that they will legalise the use of the buildings or stop their illegal use, within 15 days to the RDA. Additionally, the owners of the building will have to pay a fine of Rs1,000 for each day after the 15-day deadline.

9,Anti-smog efforts stumble,Only half of brick kilns in Rawalpindi embrace eco-friendly zigzag technology,"The Rawalpindi Anti-Smog Squad’s failure to curb smog and their inability to enforce eco-friendly zigzag technology in 189 brick kilns has exacerbated pollution levels in the twin cities.
Currently, the air quality index of Islamabad and Rawalpindi has surged to dangerous levels, indicating an alarming trend of escalating air pollution. Islamabad's air quality index has soared to 221, with Rawalpindi registering an air quality index of 202. Additionally, Murree, Chakwal, Attock, and Jhelum have reported air quality indexes of 160, 170, 172, and 171 respectively.
The rising pollution has resulted in a thick fog covering the streets of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, extending into neighbourhoods and impacting visibility from 6 am to 10 am. Diminished sunlight until 11 am, combined with dry conditions, has added to the challenges.
With each passing day, air pollution levels continue to surge in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Despite the mandate for environment-friendly technology in all kilns, barely 50 per cent have complied in the twin cities, with some kiln operators removing the installed zigzag technology due to increased operational costs.
Read  Heavy fog disrupts life in twin cities
Brick Kilns Association Secretary General Raheel Chaudhary advocated for kiln owners to have the autonomy to address smoke emissions instead of obligatory zigzag technology, fines, and penalties.
While the installation of zigzag technology incurs significant expenses, amounting to Rs2.3 million, its efficacy remains questionable. In this regard, an anti-smog squad spokesperson maintained a stance of zero tolerance, stating that non-compliant kilns would face demolition.
Furthermore, the prevalent air pollution, fog, and dry cold have also contributed to respiratory ailments, including coughs, colds, sore eyes, dry lips, fevers, and skin rashes, affecting the residents of the twin cities.
Meanwhile, the unusual foggy conditions have been attributed by weather experts to the lack of rain during this Winter season. Persistent smog due to the insignificant rain during this winter season has caused diseases among the citizens, especially those with allergy issues.
Read  Thick fog heightens risk of diseases
According to health experts, those who suffer the most from seasonal diseases are children and aged citizens. Medics have suggested increasing the intake of diets rich in essential minerals and vitamins. Naheed Raza, a mother of three children who daily travels from Rawalpindi to Islamabad to attend her office, said: “Dense foggy conditions with reduced visibility is unusual for me while living in the capital for the last many years. Even I could see the visible fog after 11am.”
She says my children have suffered from prolonged sickness including influenza, cough and high fever three times during the last two months. Doctors believe that viruses mutate into dangerous variants and there is a need to boost the immunity of children by giving them organic food and using green tea with honey and ginger.
In response to the health concerns, parents are calling for an extension of winter vacations, which have already ended in some educational institutions.
