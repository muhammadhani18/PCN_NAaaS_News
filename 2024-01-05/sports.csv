The mayor conveyed high expectations from the public and urged the officials of the companies to expedite the feasibility study and the waste-to-energy generation process. Expressing dissatisfaction with the initial project timeline presented by the companies, the mayor asked them to revise the completion timeline.

1,‘Corrupt officials patronise illegal construction’,Sources say SBCA employees are involved in allowing unauthorised portions,"A coterie of corrupt officials in the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) has become a strong mafia, sources in the authority said. 
The mafia in SBCA, with the backing of influential people including officials, is sheltering illegal construction of portions against bribes running into millions of rupees, an SBCA officer said requesting anonymity.
Residents of the Jamshed Town Zone 2 told The Express Tribune that over the last two decades, thousands of people demolished their old houses and reconstructed residences carved into small portions on the same plot. 
Therefore, on a plot of 400 square yards where two families lived on the ground and the first floor, 12 portions of 100 square yards were built in ground plus two structures. 
Thus instead of two, now there are 12 families living on the same plot, though the water, sewerage and power supply infrastructure remains unchanged.
The development of portions has put an overwhelming burden on the infrastructure while the practice has therefore been banned by the Sindh High Court.

SBCA sources said that surprisingly, development of portions was being carried out in parts of the city which are already hit by the sewage and water issues. These illegal constructions will further damage the infrastructure. Although the courts are constantly issuing orders, the illegal construction continues.
The lack of action from the SBCA and the offices of the deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners also embolden people involved in the illegal construction.
Sources said SBCA officials were involved in illegal constructions in the city, particularly in the east district, especially in Jamshed Town Zone Two. The illegal development was distorting the face of the planned localities, they said.
An extremely powerful Grade 14 officer in SBCA is supposed to own the whole Jamshed Town Zone 2 system. Residential units are being built with his consent. Sources say that the officer has the responsibility of different areas of Gulshan-e-Iqbal. 
The corrupt officer is so powerful that he even flouts orders of director of SBCA east district. 
Additionally, instead of SBCA director general, officers of Grade 16, 17, and 18 posted in Jamshed Town Zone 2 report to the said Grade 14 officers, sources added.

The fire brigade was alerted around 6pm on Thursday, and after two hours of intense battle, they extinguished the conflagration, initiating the cooling process, which continued for some time. Residents at the scene alleged that the fire was deliberately set, pointing to previous attempts. They also mentioned the presence of drug addicts in the shanties. 
Some suspect the fire may have been ignited to combat rising cold. Strong winds propelled the flames, quickly engulfing the shanties. Fire brigade officials could not immediately determine the cause of the fire or the exact number of shanties affected. 
SHO Supermarket police station Aslam Bhatti stated that there were over 200 shanties at the location, with around 60 shanties and their household goods reduced to ashes, while others were spared from the blaze.

Jamali stated, ""Our objective is to address the general conditions of the journalist community, particularly those who are working beyond their capacity at low wages, and not receiving proper facilities.""

Sheher Bano said that working conditions of journalists in seven districts of Sindh were studied. The survey's findings show that majority of journalists face issues like low and delayed salaries, lack of medical facilities, lack of washrooms and transport facilities for women. 
In her presentation, Shehar Bano also included various political party manifestos and shared insights regarding them with the participants.
Bano said one of the most serious problems is related to the security of journalists such as harassment, censorship, mental and physical violence by state or non-state bodies, registration of fake FIRs, bullying and threats.
The survey also revealed that most of the journalists are unaware of the laws which can get them relief. 
Mehnaz Rahman from the Aurat Foundation said, ""Unless the united efforts are made, journalists will continue to be exploited and weakened.""
