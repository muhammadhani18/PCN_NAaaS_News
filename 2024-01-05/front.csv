According to the military’s media wing, the operation was conducted on the reported presence of terrorists, adding that they remained involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces.
The ISPR said that the terrorists were planning to conduct a high-profile terrorist attack, which was averted due to a proactive response by the security forces.
Arms, ammunition, and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, it added.

1,CJ Isa favours ‘original Constitution’,SC reserves decision in MPs’ lifetime disqualification case,"The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday reserved its decision in the matter related to the re-examining of the lifetime disqualification of lawmakers under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution with Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faez Isa favouring the “original Constitution”, lamenting ""encroachments"" made into the country's bill of rights over the years.
“We are disregarding the fact that why these amendments were brought into the Constitution. We are disregarding the fact that the original Constitution has a greater sanctity than amendments brought unless there are such amendments which enable to serve the people better,” Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa while heading a seven-member larger bench said.
The bench also comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali resumed hearing a set of petitions to determine the disqualification period of lawmakers.
The CJP said, “We will try to come up with a shorter order as soon as possible. Probably not today but it will be very soon God willing.”
The inconsistency between court decisions and parliamentary legislation regarding the duration of disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) has prompted the apex court to intervene and determine whether the disqualification of a lawmaker should be for a lifetime or five years stipulated in the Elections Act.
The disqualification conundrum stems from the addition of Article 62(1)(f) to the Constitution by former military ruler Gen Ziaul Haq. However, the issue gained prominence when a larger bench of the Supreme Court disqualified former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for life in the Panama Papers case.
In June last year, parliament introduced an amendment to Section 232 of the Elections Act, setting the period of disqualification to five years under Article 62(1)(f). This legislative move adds a layer of complexity to the matter that the Supreme Court is now set to unravel.
During the hearing, Chief Justice Isa said, ""The original Constitution has greater sanctity.” He lamented ""encroachments"" made into the country's bill of rights over the years.
As the hearing commenced, Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party Patron-in-Chief Jahangir Tareen's counsel Advocate Makhdoom Ali Khan was called to the rostrum.
He began his arguments by stating that the Samiullah Baloch case led to a disconnect between articles 62 and 63, adding that two different considerations prevail as the language of Article 63 is different from that of Article 62.
Justice Mansoor observed that in the Samiullah case, the declaration was obvious but the duration of disqualification remained unclear.
When Justice Mandokhail asked if a civil court could issue a declaration of disqualification, the counsel said it could not.
He added that the Constitution keeps the issue of disqualification and qualification separate.
Justice Mazhar then asked if Article 62 applies to pre-election, post-election or any other time.
The advocate replied, “Article 62 is only applicable at the time of elections while Article 63 can be applied at any time it is deemed fit to be used.”
CJP Isa then interjected that the constitutional history of the country was being disregarded.
He observed that successive ""encroachment"" was made into Pakistan's Constitution, noting that despite advertisements given in newspapers, no political party had come forth stating that this was a good interpretation of the Constitution.
Tareen's counsel then stated that parliament did not mention that the declaration would be forever in the 18th Amendment.
After hearing all the arguments, the court reserved its verdict in the case.

2,Senate seeks to delay Feb 8 vote,"Thin attendance in house passes resolution citing weather, security concerns; ECP firm on schedule","In a surprising twist, just over a month ahead of the general elections, the Senate passed a resolution not once but twice to postpone the scheduled vote on February 8. The primary reasons cited were the harsh winter weather in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan and the prevailing law and order situation in these provinces.
Senator Dilawar Khan proposed the resolution, gaining support from lawmakers across various political parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), and the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP). Independent senators and those representing the erstwhile Federally-Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) also backed the resolution. The concerns outlined in the resolution encompassed the challenging law and order conditions, severe weather in Balochistan, and the ongoing terrorist activities in K-P and Balochistan.
However, PML-N Senator Afnanullah vehemently opposed the resolution, highlighting historical instances where elections proceeded even during challenging times, such as World War II and periods of terrorism in 2008, 2013, and 2018.
During the initial vote, 13 senators supported the resolution. After the Friday prayers break, Senator Dilawar Khan proposed to suspend the rules and present the resolution again, receiving approval once more. Caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi, initially absent during the voting, opposed the resolution upon his later presence in the house.
Despite the Senate's resolution, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sources insisted that the elections would proceed as scheduled on February 8, emphasizing that only the Supreme Court holds the authority to alter the election timetable.
The Senate resolution highlighted January and February as the coldest months in many areas of Balochistan and K-P. It expressed reservations about anticipated difficulties in ensuring resident participation in cold areas during the voting process.
The resolution added that foiled attempts on the lives of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and former National Assembly member (MNA) Mohsin Dawar, as well as threatening calls targeting Awami National Party's provincial chief Aimal Wali Khan and other political figures had raised concerns about the safety of political leaders, exacerbating challenges for political parties in their election campaigns.

The resolution underscored the seriousness of threats to prominent politicians, heightened attacks on security forces and citizens in K-P and Balochistan, and intelligence agency warnings of potential militant attacks on election rallies. Additionally, it raised concerns about the resurgence of COVID-19.
In response to these concerns, the resolution proposed the postponement of the scheduled elections to ensure effective political participation, safeguard constitutional rights, and address security and health challenges. It called on the Election Commission of Pakistan to promptly implement the postponement and make necessary arrangements for the smooth conduct of elections on the revised date.
Chairing the session, Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani oversaw a total of 14 members during the voting process.
The 14 members present in the house included Afnanullah, Kuhda Babar, Ahmad Omarzai, Ahmad Omar, Dilawar Khan, Abdul Qadir, Sana Jamali, Hilalur Rehman, Naseebullah Bazai, Behramand Tangi, Kamil Ali Agha, Hidayatullah and Gardeep Singh.
After the resolution's approval, Senators Palwasha Khan and Shahadat Awan sought the floor of the house, but the chairman adjourned the session. The Senate Secretariat promptly issued a notification of the resolution, forwarding it to the president, prime minister, and relevant ministries.
While past elections in Pakistan have taken place during the winter season, the advocates for the delay present historical examples of altered election dates due to floods and exceptional circumstances, asserting the need for flexibility in the face of evolving challenges.
They cite the 1997, 1985, and 2008 general elections, as well as recent local government elections in K-P held in winter, in which the JUI-F got immense success.
However, proponents of the delay argue that in 1998, the date of general elections was set after 90 days due to floods, while the elections in 2008 were held in February, 2008 instead of January 2008 after the martyrdom of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.

3,Bilawal launches election campaign from Lahore,PPP says selection of NA-127 guarantees a fighting chance," 
To get a head start on other parties in Punjab, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Thursday formally launched his election campaign from NA-127 Lahore, whereas his party announced his countrywide election rally schedule to capitalise on the political vacuum artificially created by the establishment in Pakistan.
With its only main rival in the field PML-N still deliberating on the matter of allotting tickets for Punjab and K-P, the PPP leaders were busy in their constituencies canvassing for votes since, according its central Punjab chief, the party had already given confirmation to a majority of aspiring candidates regarding award of ticket.
The announcement remains a mere formality, acting central Punjab president said.
The PPP has already revealed its 10-point agenda, which was a part of its manifesto, according to Bilawal.
The party’s information secretary on Thursday revealed that the party would reveal its manifesto in the coming few days.
The PML-N had constituted its manifesto committee over a month ago and under it, more than 30 subcommittees were formed but despite all the romp and pomp, nothing had been made public.
Recently, the PML-N announced an online portal to seek input from the public at large regarding its manifesto, which showed the entire exercise was not in its advanced stages.Rally schedule
The PPP on Thursday announced its chairman’s schedule of some 30 rallies starting on Jan 10 from Swabi and ending on Feb 6 in Larkana.
During his election campaign trail, he would address rallies in Faisalabad (Jan 11), Layah (Jan 12), Bahawalpur (Jan 13), Balochistan’s Naseerabad (Jan 14), Sindh’s Larkana (Jan 15), Qambar Shahdadkot (Jan 16) Badin and Sanghar (Jan 17), Nowshero Feroz and Dadu (Jan 18), Rahim Yar Khan (Jan 19) Kot Daud (Jan 20), Lahore (Jan 21), Chiniot (Jan 23), Sarghoda (Jan 24), Lala Musa (Jan 25) Multan (Jan 26), Peshawar (Jan 27) , Rawalpindi (Jan 28), Kurram (Jan 29), DI Khan (Jan 30), Malakand (Jan 31), Khuzdar (Feb 1), Kashmor and Shikarpur (Feb 2) Mirpurkhas (Feb 3), Hyderabad (Jan 4) and his second last rally as per schedule would be in Karachi (Jan 5).Why NA-127 Lahore
Bilawal also visited his election office at Green Town in Lahore to formally launch his election campaign, where he also met with a large number of party workers.
Bilawal will contest elections from three constituencies, including the NA-127 and party’s stronghold Larkana.
The decision of Bilawal to contest election from Lahore was welcomed by his party’s Punjab chapter that had long felt that the party leadership had given up on Punjab.
This decision to contest from Lahore, an erstwhile PML-N stronghold, was also necessitated by PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to contest from Karachi NA-242.
Though this would be Shehbaz’s second attempt to gain traction in Karachi, prior to this, Shehbaz contested from NA-249 Karachi and lost to PTI’s Faisal Vawda, though by a thin margin.
The reason of selecting this very constituency was to capitalise on the hard work of most active leaders of Lahore, Faisal Mir, who incidentally happens to be the brother of caretaker Information Minister Amir Mir and Aslam Gill. Faisal Mir, since losing the 2018 election, kept his nose to the grindstone in hopes of making to the National Assembly in the next elections.
Little did he know that his hard work would cost him his seat, a former party parliamentarian said in a lighter vein.
Mir is being accommodated on a provincial seat. Aslam Gill, is also said to have strong roots in this constituency.
Interestingly the local chapter of the party, were fully behind Gill.
By contesting from this seat, Bilawal has mitigated his chances of a white wash, the leader said.
He said that it was also an honour for those who have worked hard in this constituency that Bilawal chose his NA-127 over all others to contest from.
The PPP hopes to secure this constituency, previously known as NA-133, due to the outcome of the Dec 2021 by-election results, wherein its leader Gill had secured around 32,000 votes as compared to PML-N’s winning candidate Shaista
Pervez Malik, who had secured around 46,000. Gill, who had obtained only around 5,585 votes in 2018 secured an increase of around 26,415 votes, which was no small feat. However, the success mainly was attributed to the PTI candidates’ voluntary or involuntary misfiling of nomination papers owing to which Jamshed Cheema and his wife Musrat Jamshed Cheema got disqualified, giving Gill a walkover to bag anti-PML-N votes.
The situation, given how things are unfolding for the PTI, seems to be no different for the PPP.
The PPP does not have any sizable vote bank in the province except for a few areas.
Even in Lahore, the party does not have any mentionable presence to capitalise on.
Interestingly, the PPP was hoping to capitalise on PT’s fall.
A leader said due to the PTI’s absence from the political arena, the PPP has a golden opportunity to cash in on since anti-
PML-N vote is most likely to come their way.
The PML-N is expected to issue NA-127 ticket to its Deputy General Secretary Ata Tarar.
He said the PTI members are unlikely to get their election symbol ‘bat’ and even if they do get it, they don’t have any real chance of winning under these harsh circumstances.
Earlier in the day, Bilawal addressed a rally organised at the farmhouse of former provincial minister Abdul Ghafoor Mao. Mao prior to the rally met Bilawal and PPPP President Asif Zardari at Bilawal House and announced joining the PPPP.

4,PTI gets big relief from tribunals,"Nominations of Shiekh Rashid, Ijazul Haq, Firdous Shamim Naqvi allowed","Several Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) aspirants and its allies, returned to the election arena on Thursday after mounting successful appeals against the rejection of their nomination papers by the returning officers (ROs) during scrutiny process last week.
A day after the period of filing appeals against the ROs decisions of accepting or rejecting the nominations, the appellate tribunals started giving their rulings, while on many others, issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other relevant parties.
A number of PTI candidates, whose papers were rejected, have challenged the decisions of the RO. At the same time, objection had also been filed against the acceptance of the papers of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif in Karachi.
As per the election schedule, the nomination papers were received until December 22 and scrutinised by December 30. Later, the candidates had until Wednesday, January 3 to challenge the decisions of the ROs. The tribunals will dispose of all the appeals by January 10.
Those whose nomination papers were allowed by the appellate tribunals, include PTI Central Vice President Firdous Shamim Naqvi for NA-236, Karachi; and a party ally Sheikh Rashid and his nephew Sheikh Rashid Shafiq for NA 56 and 57 for NA 56 and 57, Rawalpindi.
Besides the nomination papers of Ijazul Haq, Punjab Assembly Speaker Sabatin Khan, Aminullah Khan, Hafeez Khan, Khaleeq Kayani, Raja Rashid Hafeez, Tahir Sadiq, his wife Naz Sadiq and daughter Iman Sadiq, Babar Jadoon, Raja Ahmed Aziz Bhatti, were also allowed to contest the elections.
On Thursday, two election tribunals in Rawalpindi, continued hearing of the appeals. They decided a total of 26 appeals – approving 20 and rejecting six. The tribunals also heard 10 appeals, while accepted 35 appeals for hearing.
While accepting the appeals of PTI founder Imran Khan, former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi and former minister Fawad Chaudhary, the judges issued notices to the ECP and the returning officers concerned.
During the hearings of the appeals, Tribunal Judge Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz remarked that the appellate tribunals had to follow the Constitution and the law. He added that political matters should not be discussed in the court.
At one point, the judge remarked that the tribunals could not stop the way of those who had surrendered in the court, while those who were still in hiding could not be allowed to go to parliament. He also expressed his surprise that why the ROs had shifted the entire burden on the tribunals.
And in the twin city of Islamabad, the appellate tribunal issued notices on the appeals of 51 candidates whose nomination papers had been rejected. The included PTI’s Ilyas Mehrban, Aamir Mughal, Shiraz Kayani, Zubair Farooq and others.
Tribunal Judge Arbab Muhammad Tahir, also issued notices to the parties concerned on the appeal against acceptance of the nomination papers of the transgender candidate and sought their response by Monday.
Justice Arbab heard the application of eunuch Almas Bobi. The petitioner’s counsel took the stand that objections to Nayab Ali’s nomination papers for NA-46 and NA-47 were raised at the scrutiny stage but those were rejected by the RO.
The objections centred around Nayab Ali’s gender mention in the national identity card. In the card, “X” was written in the gender box. The petitioner contended that the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) had declared the gender identity section of the Transgender Persons Act as unIslamic.
In Karachi, the appellate tribunal at the Sindh High Court (SHC) accepted the nomination papers of PTI Central Vice President Firdous Naqvi for NA-236, Karachi. Naqvi’s lawyer later said on social media platform X that the tribunal had declared the objections to his nomination papers as “illegal”.
According to an Express News report, the registrar of the tribunal had raised objections to the plea against approval of Shahbaz Sharif’s nomination papers from Karachi NA 242, filed the other day by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate Masood Khan Mandokhel.
Meanwhile, the tribunal issued notices to the ECP and other relevant parties on the appeals against the rejection of nomination papers of PTI candidates Aftab Jahangir for NA-244; Saeed Afridi for NA-245; Attaullah for NA-246; Aslam Khan for NA-248; Faheem Khan for NA-234; Saifur Rahman for NA-235; Subhan Ali Sahil for NA-243; Fiza Zeeshan for NA-237, and others.
Similarly, notices were also issued on the petitions, moved by Shamshad Khan of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for PS-95, PTI’s Abdul Manan from constituency PS-118; Rauf Ahmed, independents Sardar Badar Abbasi for NA-234 and Sajjad Hussain for NA-236 and PS-100.
The tribunal also issued notices on five appeals moved by former Sindh minister Zulfiqar Mirza and former National Assembly speaker Fahmida Mirza against the rejection of their nomination papers by the RO for NA 223 Badin.
In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 329 appeals had been filed against rejection or acceptance of the nomination papers of the candidates. According to the data, 116 appeals had been filed by the National Assembly candidates and 213 by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly candidates.
Appellate Tribunal Judge Shakeel Ahmed at the Peshawar High Court (PHC) issued notices to the relevant parties after preliminary hearing of appeals filed by the PTI’s Zahir Shah Toro, Asad Qaiser, Atif Khan, Shahram Tarkai, Ali Muhammad Khan, Shirafazl Marwat and others.

5,SC shows a change in approach,"CJP Isa changing approach to adjudicate matters regarding disqualification of lawmakers under Articles 62, 63","The Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa is visibly changing the approach to adjudicate matters regarding disqualification of lawmakers under Articles 62 and 63.
Unlike the past, the SC is now showing more respect toward politicians and parliament. Majority of judges have already endorsed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 which regulates the discretionary powers of the chief justice.
Since the restoration of judges in March 2009, lawmakers faced tough judicial scrutiny when it came to examining their eligibility under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.
Wherever the Constitution was silent, the Supreme Court evolved tough principles for politicians in the name of interpretation.
Same happened in two matters in which the SC declared that disqualification under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution would be for life and a defecting lawmaker’s vote would not be counted under Article 63-A.
Several lawyers consider both the judgements as the worst in the recent past. They say that the Constitution is being re-written in the name of interpretation. Dozens of lawmakers were disqualified by the apex court on account of non-disclosure of assets, holding of fake degrees and dual nationalities.
former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and IPP chief Jahangir Tareen were disqualified under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
In 2018, then chief justice Saqib Nisar constituted a five-member larger bench to examine whether or not disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution is for lifetime.
The Supreme Court held that if it declared that a lawmaker was not “Sadiq” and “Ameen—truthful and trustworthy—then he or she would be permanently disqualified from contesting the elections.
Justice Umar Ata Bandial had authored a 52-page ruling that justified permanent disqualification of parliamentarians under the constitutional provision.
Instead of referring the matter to parliament to take a final decision on the time duration of disqualification, the court comprehensively discussed the importance of Article 62(1)(f).
Then some legal experts objected to the makeup of the bench to hear the matter. Out of the five judges, four judges – Saqib Nisar, Azmat Saeed Sheikh, Umar Ata Bandial and Ijazul Ahsan – were from the province of Punjab.
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, who belonged to Sindh, was also part of that larger bench. Interestingly, most of these judges were also part of the benches, which issued rulings in high-profile cases, relating to the Panama Papers, the Elections Act 2017, and the Hanif Abbasi case
However, it is being witnessed that former CJ Umar Ata Bandial himself departed from the lifetime disqualification jurisprudence.
 In October 2018, the apex court in the Khawaja Asif case finally laid down an “objective criterion” to test the honesty of a lawmaker by declaring that the Article 62(1)(f) could not be applied to every omission or non-disclosure of assets.
In 2021, the apex court reiterated that it was now a well-settled principle that every non-disclosure or mis-declaration would not be sufficient enough to permanently disqualify a member of parliament or a candidate under the Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
“The purpose and intention needs to be seen behind the non-disclosure or mis-declaration. The returned candidate would be disqualified only when he/she has dishonestly acquired assets and is hiding them to derive certain benefits,” said an 11-page judgment authored by Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.
The verdict was issued on a petition filed by a politician, Shamona Badshah Qaisarani, who was disqualified for lifetime over non-disclosure of her agricultural property inherited from her parents in the nomination papers.
“If the non-disclosure or mis-declaration is such that it gives an illegal advantage to a candidate, then it would lead to termination of his candidature,” the judgement added.  Interestingly, Justice Bandial who had authored lifetime disqualification, was also signatory to this judgement.
