Expressing concerns over the election outcome, Ghuri stated, “JUI-F is apprehensive about the final results. The party feels marginalized, with seats seemingly allocated by external forces.
However, we are determined to confront this challenge, and a comprehensive strategy will be formulated following thorough deliberations.”

1,ANP’s Aimal Wali rejects polls results,Announces end to politics of non-violence,"Awami National Party (ANP)’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) President Aimal Wali Khan has rejected the election results outright and announced a province-wide protest drive.
Addressing a press conference at Bacha Khan Markaz in Peshawar, Wali said that the party demands recounting of votes on all seats where ANP candidates remained runner-ups.
“These are the worst elections in the history of the province in terms of result manipulation. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf won the elections but at the same time its important leaders lost their seats to the ‘result change’,” he said, adding that it was part of a conspiracy that ANP’s and PTI’s important leaders have been kept out of assemblies.

He observed that the polls management started with the closure of mobile phone network across the country. “Let me tell you this is less election and more selection”.
“Those who managed to enter into a deal with the powerful quarters won despite their affiliation with PTI. And those within PTI who didn’t strike a deal lost out,” he alleged, adding that those in power want to have a ‘Balochistan-like’ government in K-P too.
“Even an Afghan national won from Hayatabad because he is acceptable to the establishment,” he said, adding that millions were demanded from the ANP candidates by ROs.
Wali said that only the establishment in this country is free and Pakistan’s debt is going up with each passing year.
He announced an end to the politics of non-violence.

2,"PTI to establish govt in K-P, vows Gandapur",Warns govt servants against result tampering,"Ali Amin Gandapur, the provincial president of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), emphasized the resilience of PTI workers in the face of challenges, including harassment by law enforcement, FIRs against party leaders, and interference by government officials.
He issued a stern warning to those involved in manipulating election results, cautioning government servants against meddling in the electoral process. Gandapur asserted PTI’s determination to form the government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
He condemned attempts to alter Form 47s and manipulate the results of winning PTI candidates, labeling such actions as high treason. Gandapur highlighted the gravity of the situation, emphasizing that those responsible for electoral misconduct would be held accountable in due time.
Background
Independent candidates continued to consolidate their lead in the General Elections 2024 over mainstream political parties, completing the century of victors in the National Assembly for the first time ever, according to the results announced by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) till Saturday.
Barring a few, independents, backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), have crossed the 300 mark, when the number of winners in the provincial assembly were added. They clean-swept the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, and won a sizeable chunk in Punjab, according to the ECP Form-47 results.
The PTI could not contest the elections on Thursday because it was denied its electoral symbol of ‘bat’ due to its controversial intra-party elections. Instead, the party fielded its candidates as independent with different electoral symbols.

By Saturday, the ECP issued the Form-47 results of 255 National Assembly constituencies. Election could not be held on one National Assembly and three provincial assembly seats because of the death of the candidates. The ECP had also ordered re-polling at one National and two provincial constituencies.
