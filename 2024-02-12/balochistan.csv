1,Zakat crisis deepens,Paucity of funds leaves the destitute in the lurch,"As many as 24,000 deserving Zakat beneficiaries across the Rawalpindi division have been deprived of financial support for the last six months or so, thanks to the non-election of the chairmen of 3,510 local Zakat committees of the Punjab Zakat & Ushr department and non-release of zakat fund.
The free treatments, operations and dialysis of deserving patients have also halted in various hospitals as thousands of widows are still desperately awaiting financial assistance.
The caretaker government has also “failed” to appoint the chairman of the district Zakat committee despite the passing of 15 months. The deputy commissioner is acting as the acting chairman of the Zakat committee, while local Zakat committees are also being run by temporary administrators on an ad hoc basis.

The district Zakat committee has also not released marriage grants to the girls of poor families in the past six months. Similarly, financial assistance for educational scholarships and leprosy and blind patients has also been halted.
Poor patients admitted to hospitals for free treatments including dialysis have been discharged without surgery. Hospital officials claim that the free treatment will resume once zakat funds are released by the caretaker government.
Affectees Misbah Bibi and Halima Begum told The Express Tribune that they are being refused payments by the officials concerned each month. They appealed to the caretaker chief minister to immediately release Zakat funds on humanitarian grounds for their smooth domestic expenditure and free treatment.

Copies of the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) Form 45 are provided to each polling agent by the presiding officers of each polling station and it is the document in which agents enter original vote counts of each candidate.
Petitioners claimed that they have forms for each station that they have filed complaints against. They said according to the forms, they did not lose from any polling station while those who had been declared victors did not secure enough votes. They added that not only them but other parties’ candidates also have these forms, which also validates their success. The candidates included copies of Form 45 a part of their petitions in which they demanded that the victory notification of successful candidates should be cancelled. They also requested the high court seek completed forms from the successful candidates as well.
A lawyers’ team comprising Sardar Abdul Raziq, Malik Faisal, Shaukat Rauf Siddiqui, and Rizwan Akhtar claimed that they have original copies of each constituency’s Form 45. They were hopeful that all the seats in question would be returned to their clients.
Petitions of all other provincial candidates have also been prepared and will be filed on Monday, February 12. The hearing on these petitions is likely to begin on Monday or Tuesday.
The Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi Bench is likely to have a very busy week due to the filed petitions.
