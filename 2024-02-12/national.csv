0,10 urgent challenges for govt,There is no time to relax for the incoming government; let’s get back to work,"Unexpected events happen in Pakistan all the time. Two years ago, speculations were rife about early elections. Lately, conspiracy theorists believed elections would be delayed.
Nevertheless, Pakistan has successfully conducted elections and is ready to move forward towards better economic policymaking. Whether the results will be accepted and if the new government will complete five years is another debate. For now, there are 10 clear indicators that need the attention of those taking the helm of affairs:
Going back to the IMF programme: On day one of cabinet formation, messaging the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of the intent to embark upon a new programme and adequately completing current standby agreements is crucial.
There are no viable or unviable options except to seek support from the IMF and bilateral friends to provide economic certainty to businesses, investors, and lenders. Do not hesitate to make the intent public.
Debt deleveraging: The IMF, along with other bilateral and multilateral lenders, will clearly assess Pakistan’s debt repayment ability over the next three to five years and dictate reforms needed to address the issue.
While domestic debt restructuring in the form of higher taxes on sovereign yields is preferable to immediate haircuts, external debt needs to be elongated with softer terms to buy time and implement reforms. Structural reforms: No lender will grant a grace period, nor will any friendly country continue to provide financial support until tangible efforts are made to fix the house and rectify mistakes.
Under Shamshad Akhtar’s caretaker leadership, efforts were made to control circular debt, privatise Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), hand over DISCOs management to the private sector, streamline Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for tax reforms, pave the way for foreign investors, reduce economic subsidies to the elite, and delegate provincial expenses back to provinces in a modified National Finance Commission (NFC) award form. Painful yet necessary decisions need continuity and commitment.

Controlled expenses: Government expenditure needs to be tamed, whether current or discretionary, to live within means. Limiting salary hikes is not the solution; rather, abolishing and merging inefficient government departments is necessary to restore productivity to policy making.
Additionally, PSDP (Public Sector Development Programme) remains a luxury if any funds remain after securing a primary surplus. By taxing more effectively, funds can be allocated to development. Investing in people rather than just infrastructure is the key.
Continued privatisation: Recent gains in the privatisation process, especially concerning PIA, must reach their logical conclusion to reduce the burden on the exchequer. Immediately, Pakistan Steel Mills and loss-making DISCOs should be handed over to the private sector with complete authority to reform processes and manpower.
Growing exports: Economic prosperity, improvements in the middle and lower classes’ lifestyles, self-sufficiency, increased geopolitical weight, reduced debt burden, and job creation all hinge on increasing the export-to-GDP ratio from 8% to 15%.
The government must encourage both foreign and domestic investment that increases value-added (without subsidy) exports in agriculture, IT, industrial goods, and services. Fair taxation: Currently, 80-90% of tax revenues are used to service interest on debt, let alone the principal repayment. Hence, even with Rs9 trillion revenues, the country cannot move towards sustainable growth.
The tax-to-GDP ratio cannot increase from 9% to 15-20% until agriculture, real estate, traders, and retailers, which are major components of annual GDP, are taxed fairly. Politicians need to prioritise fair taxation over their vote banks and vested interests. Reducing cash in circulation: Improved digital transactions must be incentivised with lower taxes, refunds, and rewards. Beyond a certain threshold, all transactions should be conducted via banking instruments to formalise the economy and accurately record the flow of wealth.
It’s crucial to understand that demonetisation of currency is the long-term solution to accelerate growth, drive a digital revolution, combat corruption, and enhance the tax-to-GDP ratio. Short-term economic impacts should not overshadow focus on the next five years.
Population control: Resources, however limited and blessed by the Almighty, are finite. The growing population is challenging to feed, let alone provide with basic necessities such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
Disincentives need to be implemented in BISP (Benazir Income Support Programme) for having a second or third child, particularly in rural areas where children are often seen as assets to be employed as labour.
State Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC): Despite scepticism, SIFC remains a supreme body of civil-military collaboration essential for immediate house-fixing. The credibility provided to foreign and local investors through the validation and impression exerted by issuing instructions with the consent of the military is invaluable.
Foreign investment must be carefully evaluated on a long-term basis for net dollar inflow, and the structural reforms agreed upon at SIFC will remain the key to prosperity.
Economic dashboards must be prepared by the cabinet, with each ministry remaining accountable to the people to fast-track efficient decision making. The pace witnessed during the caretaker government must be doubled to catch up with lost growth seen in neighbouring countries. Technocrats, private sector individuals, and overseas Pakistanis willing to contribute to the country’s progress must be brought onboard under “remake Pakistan.” There is no time to relax; let’s get back to work.

1,Engaging youth in democratic process,"Youth hold immense potential to drive positive change, shape nation’s future","The year 2024 heralds a global wave of elections, with approximately 49% of the world’s population in over 64 countries gearing up to cast their votes. Yet, it is not merely the act of voting itself that distinguishes these elections from the previous ones; rather, it is the process leading up to them and the subsequent outcomes that set them apart.
Historically, Pakistan’s electoral process has always been marred by allegations of irregularities and lack of fairness. However, in recent times, the advent of social media and technology has exposed the darkest and ugliest of aspects of this process to the 55 million young voters already wary of the whole democratic process.
In Pakistan, the youth constitute a significant segment of the population, holding immense potential to drive positive change and shape the nation’s future. However, disillusionment with the existing democratic process has led many young, educated Pakistanis to seek opportunities abroad, undermining the country’s ability to harness their talents and energies.
Brain drain trend
As discussed in my article last year titled “Capitalising on human capital”, recent years have witnessed a notable trend of young, educated Pakistanis migrating abroad in search for better livelihood opportunities and a more conducive environment for personal and professional growth.
According to recent figures, over 860,000 Pakistanis left the country to look for better job opportunities abroad during 2023, the highest number since 2015. The most striking feature of this trend is the exodus of highly skilled professionals who failed to secure a decent living and have no confidence in the system to deliver.
Addressing disillusionment
The exodus of young, educated Pakistanis underscores a deep-seated disillusionment with the existing democratic process and governance structures. Perceived corruption, lack of transparency and disconnect between elected representatives and the electorate have eroded trust in Pakistan’s democratic institutions, driving many talented individuals to seek opportunities elsewhere.
To reverse this trend, it is imperative to restore faith in the democratic process and demonstrate that meaningful change is achievable through active civic engagement.
Read: Youth, women turn out in numbers
Most mainstream parties rely on so-called “electables” to ensure their success and are not willing to take chances on the young generation. Central to revitalising Pakistan’s democratic landscape is the active engagement and participation of the youth.
By empowering young people to participate in electoral processes, political decision-making and community initiatives, we can harness their energy and idealism to drive positive change.
Initiatives such as voter education programmes, youth-led advocacy campaigns and grassroots mobilisation efforts can help cultivate a culture of civic engagement and instill a sense of ownership in shaping the country’s future.
Ensuring transparency
The key to restoring confidence in democratic institutions is ensuring transparency and accountability in the electoral process and forming a new government post-election. This entails robust mechanisms for electoral oversight, including independent monitoring of voting procedures, verification of ballot counts, and adjudication of electoral disputes.
Moreover, elected representatives must be held accountable for their actions, with mechanisms in place to track their performance, fulfill campaign promises, and address concerns of their constituents.
In the digital age, technology presents unprecedented opportunities for democratising governance and enhancing civic participation. By leveraging digital platforms for voter registration, election monitoring, and public engagement, we can foster greater transparency, efficiency and inclusivity in the democratic process.
The use of long overdue electronic voting system and voting rights for overseas Pakistanis (mostly youth) will give them a sense of connection and belonging back to their homeland.
Revamping manifestos
In the lead-up to the 2024 elections, the political landscape was abuzz with promises, manifestos and rhetoric aimed at capturing the hearts and minds of voters.
However as revenue collection dwindles, economic growth stagnates and Pakistan grapples with stringent conditions of an IMF programme, the promises made by political contenders appear increasingly divorced from the challenges at hand. These empty promises cannot appeal to the youth who are well versed with ground realities and demand a more realistic approach to overhaul the ailing economy.
Against this backdrop, it is imperative to engage youth in the democratic process, instilling confidence in their ability to effect meaningful change and holding representatives accountable for their actions.
Let’s adopt these strategies that have worked globally for empowering youth participation and ensuring transparency and accountability in the upcoming democratic transition, thereby ensuring inclusive and sustainable development.

2,A ‘boiling frog’ situation,"Interest payments exceed govt’s tax revenues – a recipe for default, economic meltdown","Pakistan’s Rs38.8 trillion domestic and Rs24.1 trillion external debt mountain is a “boiling frog” phenomenon for the economy as higher deficits and ballooning debt servicing costs are unsustainable.
A boiling frog situation is one in which people fail to act on a potential problem that grows over time, causing it to become more severe until it eventually bubbles over.
A frog thrown in boiling water might jump out, but if the water comes to boil slowly, it’s too late by the time it notices it’s been cooked. The age-old metaphor could easily apply to Pakistan’s debt situation.
Net interest payments on debt already exceed the government’s total tax revenues, a recipe for a “disorderly” default and subsequently an economic meltdown.
Governments have two ways to generate revenues – taxation and borrowing. Year-on-year Pakistan has continuously failed in its tax collection and has, unfortunately, excelled in its capacity to borrow to no-end, thus falling into a non-ending debt trap.
Persistent fiscal imbalances lead to non-existent fiscal space for state building, further pushing the state into weakening trajectories. State building and fiscal capacity can only occur if the focus is on generating revenues through efficient tax collection over borrowing.
An ineffective tax policy and inefficient tax bureaucracy has kept Pakistan’s tax-to GDP ratio around 9% over the last several decades. Pakistan needs to increase revenue collection at all levels to improve the ratio to 20-25%.
Myopic revenue-thirsty governments have dodged tax reforms and embraced reckless borrowing, bringing the economy down to its knees.
The state’s focus should be on its ability to collect the maximum amount of tax revenue with the minimum amount of harm to the economy so as to achieve sustainable and robust economic growth. Resorting to excessive borrowing gives you the opposite results.
If Pakistan has to overcome the twin inter-related malaises of fiscal deficit and debt burden, then there is no other option but to dismantle the existing outdated and anti-growth tax system. A two-pronged tax reform agenda is the need of the hour:
One – replace/restructure the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) with a national tax agency (NTA). Two – a total rationalisation of the tax system.
Read: Debt repayment
Replacing/restructuring the FBR with NTA is to ensure effective enforcement of tax laws both at federal and provincial levels. The country’s taxation system is complex and involves multiple agencies, which make the overall system inefficient.
The NTA with the mandate to impose a simple and harmonised tax code should be established to replace/restructure the FBR and all other federal tax authorities in the country.
It will be responsible for collecting taxes at the federal level with an active role of the National Tax Council (NTC). Provincial tax authorities will be similarly structured and streamlined to provide ease and simplicity to taxpayers.
The NTA will report to parliament through the minister of finance and the appointment of its chairman and members shall be through a public hearing by a joint committee of the National Assembly and the Senate.
It will not assume the role of a legislator and policymaker which under the constitution is the sole prerogative of the people of Pakistan through their elected representatives (Towards flat, low-rate, broad and predictable taxes – Bukhari and Haq, Prime 2020).
A total rationalisation of the tax system is to maximise tax revenues through voluntary compliance.
Pakistan, a country of 241 million inhabitants, has an extremely narrow tax base; currently at 10 million individuals, out of which 5 million are tax return filers and only 3 million actually pay any tax.
Exorbitant and punitive tax rates encourage tax evasion, avoidance and not to report taxable income. They also encourage taxpayers to seek exemptions, concessions, exclusions, credits, amnesties and write-offs.
The key to a good tax policy is a flat, low-rate, broad-based and predictable tax system. People in like circumstances should have similar tax burdens. The perception of fairness is the key to voluntary compliance but the relatively effortless implementation shouldn’t fool you. It will have massive beneficial consequences.
To broaden the tax base, from 10 million to 20 million individuals, the country should put in place a 10% flat-rate tax on all (unadjustable) gross incomes regardless of the source.
All individuals should be facilitated to file a simple income tax return, without a wealth tax statement and those earning below the taxable limit should be paid income support in the form of negative tax. A single-page return form should be available in English, Urdu and all regional languages that can even be submitted through a simple mobile app.
Historically, our elite are in favour of tax reform as long as it maintains their privileges. For a tax reform to be considered truly revolutionary, there needs to be a strong political will to resist the lobbies and bureaucracy that have helped sustain the current morass.
There is now consensus amongst all that unless and until we get out of this “boiling frog” situation, our economic miseries will not end and may eventually lead to a devastating end.

3,LPG cylinders: track and trace system,"Illegal manufacturers thrive on low quality material, putting lives at risk","Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder safety situation is not very good in Pakistan. Every year, there are many cylinder explosions, leading to deaths and injuries. Explosions occur usually during transport and users’ locations.
There are two main reasons for cylinder explosions – low quality manufacturing using inappropriate material; and damage and wear and tear during handling over a period of time.
Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) does try to control the menace of unauthorised manufacturing by issuing licences to LPG cylinder manufacturing companies after thorough checking and control over quality assurance procedures. But low quality manufacturing by unauthorised manufacturers goes on.
We will in this space discuss as to what else can be done over and above existing controls and practices to improve safety issues in this respect.
There are, reportedly, 10 to 12 LPG cylinder manufacturers who carry Ogra licence. As opposed to this, there are scores of illegal unlicensed manufacturers.
These manufacturers thrive on low prices and low quality material. They also economise on the thickness of steel. The question, however, is how do supplies from illegal manufacturers find their way to the market.
LPG filling and marketing companies receive licence from Ogra. Do they buy these supplies and how to know about it if they do?
There are third-party wholesalers also, which may or may not be registered. Most probably, they introduce the illegally manufactured cylinders in market. Retailers may also be buying cylinders from open market, which may be carrying these illegally manufactured cylinders. So, what to do?
First is increasing the rigour in control of operations and practices of LPG filling and marketing companies for preventing the influx of illegal cylinders. It goes without saying that illegal manufacturers should be identified and legal process be applied to them.
Ogra has specified once in five years testing of cylinders which should be able to identify defective cylinders. Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP) has been entrusted to test and certify compressed natural gas (CNG) cylinders with satisfactory results. Same can be done by HDIP for the LPG cylinders.
Read: LPG transporters banned from roads
However, CNG cylinders cannot be manufactured by the unorganised sector as it involves heavy hick metal work, while LPG cylinders can be manufactured by the unorganised sector and control over the latter is not easy.
Nevertheless, collaboration between Ogra and HDIP is desirable to control the illegal manufacturing of unsafe LPG cylinders.
There is a new technology of track and trace system, which is being applied to track and trace cylinders. More expensive solutions even identify the location of cylinders.
This is being applied in industrialised countries. Even in our region, in India, some LPG companies have started using it. The cheapest solution is RFID-based, which is nothing but a normal barcode or QR code printed on a label.
That label is pasted on the collar of cylinder appropriately. RFID can be scanned and data logged on a cloud system. This would reveal all data about that cylinder such as the name of manufacturer, date, testing, approval, ownership of cylinder, etc.
Perhaps in this way, one can find out or have some control to identify illegal cylinders. Obviously, data on all cylinders have to be first fed into the system, which may be time consuming.
One can start with new incoming cylinders. LPG filling and marketing companies may be required to install the system.
Through a computerised system, it may be possible to control and audit practices of LPG filling and marketing companies. RFID is well known in the country and can be easily introduced.
Other system is more expensive. It contains a hardware piece that contains GPS, which indicates the current location or even the history of locations. It contains all other data that is kept by the RFID system. Both systems are accompanied by a cloud-based management software system.
As they say, garbage in and garbage out. Some effort and system has to be applied by the regulator through surprise checks and audits.
Better LPG marketing companies may voluntarily adopt the system while other low-class companies may not. Ogra or third-party inspectors may be employed for doing random checks.
LPG cylinders are safety items. Human life is in danger due to illegal cylinder making without paying any attention to quality and safety. Those who can, have stopped keeping LPG cylinders in kitchens and prefer to place these outside and connect it through a long flexible pipe.
Ogra should take the matter seriously and correct the situation. LPG marketing companies should not be faceless. Their name should be printed on cylinders they are filling.
They should be made responsible for checking the credentials and condition of cylinders. Track and trace system may be considered and studied for early implementation. Otherwise manual monitoring processes should be strengthened. Free for all in the LPG safety regime must go.

4,Spectre of default haunts US banks,"Many commercial properties facing trouble in repaying loans, which may further fuel banking crisis","The Covid-19 pandemic is almost gone, but it is still haunting the US real estate sector and its banking system. Large office buildings, vacated right after the outbreak of the deadly virus, are still empty as the work-from-home model has been increasingly adopted, causing hefty losses to owners of high rises and making it impossible for them to repay bank financing.
In another crisis, the eruption of Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022 triggered a spike in inflation across the world, which forced scores of central banks including the US Federal Reserve to jack up interest rate to record highs. This deepened the real estate and banking crisis in the world’s largest economy, which has long been a champion of capitalism.
The real estate-driven financial turmoil has taken its toll on a number of regional and small banks in America and has also badly shaken large financial institutions but they are believed to have survived the crisis.
The recent trouble at New York Community Bank and Japan’s Aozora Bank sparks fears among people that some banks may have started feeling the repercussions of the commercial real estate sector’s downturn, it has been learnt.
New York Community Bank unexpectedly reported on January 31 a loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 and slashed dividend by more than two-thirds. Its stock price fell nearly 38% that day, the largest decline in 30 years since its listing. The stock hit a 23-year low.
US-based global business magazine Fortune reported that some of the commercial real estate loans had been acquired from big banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citi. However, it is the primary business of regional banks, which is why the crisis is feared to hit the regional banking space hard.
Many commercial real estate developers and investors took out large loans after the global financial crisis in 2009 when rates were low, but these are maturing and due to be repaid in the coming years.
In the aftermath of the pandemic, many companies adopted a completely remote or hybrid work model, which has led companies, large and small, to shed a great deal of their office footprint. Take for example Fannie Mae and Wells Fargo, which both recently let go of hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space in Washington DC and Raleigh NC, respectively, the magazine added.
Read: Default probability not strong: Fitch
What is even worse than the current losses is that, according to the American Mortgage Bankers Association, commercial mortgage loans for hundreds of large US office buildings are due this year, with a total value of $117 billion.
By the end of 2025, with up to $560 billion in loans due, these property owners may have difficulty refinancing in the current high interest rate environment. A large number of commercial properties in the United States are facing difficulties in repaying or refinancing, which may further fuel banking crisis.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered further bad news to the commercial real estate industry at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. While he warned that a March rate cut may not happen, the Fed removed the following sentence from the policy statement: “The US banking system is sound and resilient”.
Sceptics say the Federal Reserve no longer believes that “the US banking system is sound and resilient” – is this sign of recent economic turmoil, or was it just a lie before, and now the banking dominoes are falling again.
The collapse also means that the US banking industry is no longer stable, and is also facing a potential systemic crisis.
Defaults could put pressure on regional banks. In December 2023, US economists found that 40% of office loans on banks’ balance sheets showed a negative equity, which could pile pressure on dozens of regional banks that hold those loans.
In a TV interview the other day, Powell said “it feels like a problem we’ll be working on for years…it’s a sizable problem (albeit) a manageable one” that is more likely to affect smaller or regional banks.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Pakistan-based independent analyst Adnan Agar said the US Federal Reserve had apparently delayed the first cut in its benchmark interest rate to May 2024 from the previously expected timeline of March 2024, severely impacting businesses and households as they heavily relied on bank financing.
He said new job opportunities in the US remained higher than expected with no significant impact from the high rate scenario. This situation has forced the central bank to keep delaying the rate cut for quite a long time.
The Fed is not reducing the rate despite a slowdown in inflation to 3.5% from the multi-decade high of 9-9.5% in the recent past. “The US usually finds inflation reading suitable at 2%,” he said.
The high interest rate is badly hurting households. They are defaulting on loan repayments including mortgage financing as a large number of employees in the US work on daily or weekly wages. Banks are the ultimate loser in this scenario.
