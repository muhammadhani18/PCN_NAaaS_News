0,Kakar brushes off foreign criticism on poll fairness,PM says ‘independents’ high rate of success proof of govt impartiality,"Caretaker Anwaarul Haq Kakar has brushed off criticism from foreign countries regarding the general elections and said that it is “not that big a deal”.
“We will do if it is required under the country’s laws,” the prime minister said while addressing a news conference at the PM Office.
Kakar, responding to a question regarding the statements of certain countries over the recently held elections, said that if there were any allegations, they would look into them according to the laws of the land and not on the demands of any country.
The prime minister said the demands of his countrymen were more important to the government and advised that the statements by certain US Congressmen should not be taken as ‘sacrosanct’ or gospel truth as they were not speaking on part of the government.
He said Pakistan had a huge diaspora in the United States, some of whom had “quite an active role in domestic politics and have their own inclinations towards domestic politics here so at times it is quite easy for you to settle there, participate in local fundraising and you’ll be able to influence one, two or a few members of US Congress”.
Kakar said US Congress members did not “represent the gospel truth” and were not the “pedestal of do [and] does [not]”.
He said there were other important issues for them to comment on.
Hitting back at the allegations of the caretaker government’s failure to ensure a level playing field in the recently concluded elections, Kakar questioned the validity of further complaints.
He pointed out that PTI loyalists were permitted to contest the polls, prompting him to ask what more was desired.
Prime Minister Kakar challenged the narrative of unfairness, notably highlighting the substantial presence of PTI supporters within the National Assembly.

“How can accusations of rigging be justified when the PTI-aligned faction constitutes the largest group in the assembly?” he queried.
He emphasized that a large number of independent candidates, supported by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, emerged as the largest single group in both the national and provincial assemblies' seats through a process he described as ‘free and fair.’
He stressed that the allegations of rigging were generated through social media which were based on misconceptions and contrary to ground realities.
He said that throughout the country’s democratic history, people had always questioned the electoral process.
The prime minister acknowledged that there might have been shortcomings or minor issues, but overall, the elections were held in a manner in which the entire nation and the law-enforcement agencies deserved kudos, especially considering the myriad security challenges faced.
“Where the PTI commanded public support, it received that, achieving results beyond their expectations from the 2018 elections,” he remarked. He further noted that loyalists of incarcerated PTI leaders emerged as successful candidates in the general elections, yet this aspect of the caretaker government's neutrality was not being duly appreciated.
In response to a query, the PM highlighted that despite numerous threats preceding the February 8 election day and two terrorist attacks in Balochistan, all stakeholders deserved commendation for the significant achievement of ensuring the peaceful conduct of the polls.
He also brushed aside any notion of threats to the integrity of the country stemming from certain protests and agitations held by specific parties, stating that it was “absurd” to draw parallels with the situation in Dhaka during 1971.
“Such comparisons are merely rhetoric. Pakistan is a stable and responsible nation. The peaceful exercise of protest is a democratic right of the people,” he emphasized but hastened to add that no government could permit a situation that leads to chaos or anarchy.
Responding to a query, he maintained that over 60 million voters had exercised their constitutional right to elect their favourite candidates under ‘a pressure-free environment’.
Kakar explained that the delay in announcing the official results was attributed to the specific procedures involved in compiling results from the 92,000 polling stations and credited the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for conducting the massive exercise in a smooth manner.

He said that the official results were announced within 36 hours while during the 2018 elections, it took almost 66 hours. There might be irregularities but the relevant forums were available to address those grievances.
In Sweden, the similar exercise almost took 10 to 11 days while in Indonesia, almost a month was consumed to furnish results, he added.
To another question, the prime minister said that mobile phone services were suspended on the polling day due to security threats as the government could not compromise on the security of people.
On the other hand, the broadband internet services were available on that day, enabling the people to get connected, he said and rebuffed allegations that the move was aimed at managing the social media.
He said there were other occasions throughout the year, when the mobile services had been suspended to avert security threats.
The elections in Pakistan were held in a free and fair manner and there was no institutional mechanism to favour any group, he stressed.
Responding to a query about the prospects of forming a commission to investigate the polls allegations, he maintained that it would be up to the upcoming elected government to make assessments over such demands and decide, but he would not speculate about it.

About the security threats, he said that there were credible reports of terrorist attacks in the country prior to the election date which could not be divulged in the public domain. A leader of the banned Daesh was neutralized during an operation in Qilla Saifullah who was involved in terrorist attacks in Balochistan.
The caretaker prime minister also agreed with the President’s views over the need of introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and said that according to his personal view, the political parties should hold threadbare discussions in the next parliament over the issue and legislate if required so that the new electoral system could be more acceptable to all.
He expressed the optimism that after the current transitional period was over and the new government was formed, there would be a positive wave hitting the markets and businesses, adding that economic challenges would still await the next government.
The prime minister also hailed the entry of new voters and said that they would make positive contributions to the democratic process in the future.
To a question, he said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had no issue with the privatization process of the caretaker government.
Expressing his disapproval of the incidents of political confrontation in the recent years, he said that all political parties and society should move beyond such negative trends leading to animosity and tiffs.
“We should get rid of this vicious circle of confrontation by changing attitudes. Political differences should not lead to rifts within the society,” he added.
He also wished speedy recovery to Mohsin Dawar, a candidate in North Waziristan and said that violent way of protest and agitation should not be taken to a point of anarchy and chaos.
About formation of the new government, the prime minister said that they were eager to hand over reigns of the government to the elected representatives of the people.
The speaker of the National Assembly would initiate the required process and he thought that the exercise could take eight to nine days depending upon the outcome of the negotiations of the political parties.

1,"Tareen, Siraj & Khattak throw in the towel","IPP, JI and PTI-P heads step down after lackluster poll performance","In a jaw-dropping development, Istehkam-e-Pakistan chief Jahangir Tareen and Jamat-e-Islam emir Sirajul Haq on Monday hit the exit doors following their parties’ lacklustre performance in the shocking aftermath of February 8 general elections that saw political heavyweights tumbling.
Meanwhile, Pervez Khattak, chief of his breakaway faction of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PTI-Parliamentarians, has also resigned from his party position, saying that he is “taking a break” from politics for now.
Tareen, once the right-hand man of the incarcerated ex-PM and PTI founder Imran Khan, faced a crushing defeat in the nationwide polls, with his freshly-baked party securing only two National Assembly (NA) and one provincial assembly seats.
He suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of PTI-backed independent candidate in Multan, Malik Aamir Dogar, garnering a mere 50,166 votes, paling in comparison to Dogar's 143,613 votes.
Throwing in the towel, Tareen declared his political retirement on X, saying, “I would like to thank everyone who supported me in this election and want to offer my congratulations to my opponents. I have immense respect for the will of the people of Pakistan.”
“Therefore, I have decided to resign from my position as Chairman IPP and step away from politics altogether.”
I would like to thank everyone who supported me in this election and want to offer my congratulations to my opponents. I have immense respect for the will of the people of Pakistan. Therefore, I have decided to resign from my position as Chairman IPP and step away from politics…
“My gratitude to all the members of IPP. I wish them the absolute best. By the Grace of Allah, I will continue to serve my country to the best of my ability in a private capacity. May the next few years see Pakistan prosper IA. Pakistan Zindabad,” he added.
However, hours after reports of his resignation, Pervaiz Khattak refuted the rumours, saying that the reports were baseless and misleading. He asserted he was committed to public service.
He acknowledged the election results and accepted the outcome with humility, acknowledging the decision made by the electorate.

Meanwhile, hot on the heels of Tareen's exit, Sirajul Haq, the head of the politico-religious party, waved the white flag, saying, ""I accept responsibility for the election defeat and have resigned from the post of party ameer.""
Qaiser Sharif, the central secretary of information for JI, verified the news about the party chief's resignation. The resignation was submitted by the chief, taking accountability for the unsatisfactory electoral outcomes in the recent general polls.
He disclosed that an emergency session of the central shura has been called by JI's Secretary General, Ameerul Azeem, scheduled for February 17 at the party's headquarters in Mansoora Lahore.
 
الیکشن میں شکست کی ذمہ داری قبول کرتے ہوئے جماعت اسلامی کی امارت سے استعفی دے دیا ہے۔
He mentioned, ""The central shura's deliberations will kick off at 10 am, pondering the aftermath of the JI chief's resignation.""
The resignation by the JI chief came after the party failed to secure any National Assembly seats and only secured three seats in the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies, one of which was vacated earlier on Monday by JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman.
Earlier in the day, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rahman announced that he is forfeiting the PS-129 Sindh Assembly seat in favour of the PTI-backed candidate.
Naeem had won from PS-129 Karachi Central VIII with 26,296 votes with PTI-backed independent candidate Saif Bari securing 11,357 votes.
In a press conference, Naeem stated that PTI-backed candidate Saif Bari secured 11,357 votes and that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had altered the results.
""I give up this seat,"" announced Naeem and added that ""independent candidate Saif Bari won in a genuine manner, whose votes were reduced to 11,000 from 31,000”.

2,"JI, GDA toughen stance against poll rigging in Sindh","JI’s Naeem forfeits PA seat; GDA’s two MPAs-elect will not take oath, announces sit-in at Hyderabad Bypass on Friday","Claims of a rigged election gained momentum in Sindh on Monday, as Hafiz Naeemur Rehman of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) relinquished his seat in the provincial assembly, while two elected Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) members opted not to take office as lawmakers.
These actions fuelled public suspicion surrounding the Feb 8 vote, already under scrutiny due to legal challenges. Both the JI and the GDA experienced significant setbacks, winning only a fraction of the seats they had secured in the 2018 elections. This context adds another layer to their accusations of rigging.
Rehman, the JI Karachi Ameer, told a news conference that he would not avail the PS-129, Karachi seat because the available Form 45 records showed that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed independent candidate had actually bagged the majority of votes in the constituency.
“The Jamaat-e-Islami has been demanding transparency and fairness in the poll results and it will not seek a single seat or vote that is not cast for it,” he said, adding that this seat was a slap on the face of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Detailing the reasons behind his decision, he said that after a total count of the votes as per Form 45, it emerged that the he (Rehman) bagged 30,464 votes, while the PTI-backed independent received more votes than him. The ECP had declared Rehman the winner with over 26,000 votes.
“Jamaat-e-Islami believes in honesty and high moral values, so he would not avail the seat in favour of the PTI-backed independent candidate,” he said, adding that he did not want to be a part of a “nefarious game” run by the ECP. “Is this called an election,” he posed a question.
The JI leader said that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and all those who were delivering victory speeches on the basis of rigged and fake mandate should be ashamed.
The GDA, meanwhile, which held a meeting in Karachi, with its head Pir Pagara Pir Sibghatullah Shah in the chair, called a protest sit-in on the Hyderabad Bypass on Feb 16, and invited other parties to join their protest against the election rigging.

“We reject these elections because these were an anti-state election,” Pir Pagara told reporters. “I call this election an anti-state election because [Zulfikar Ali] Bhutto had 60 seats and Mujibur Rahman had 107 seats [in the 1970 elections] and it is in front of everyone when the majority opinion was not accepted.”
Pir Pagara said that a friend had advised him to disband the GDA and contest the election from the platform of his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Functional (PML-F), by forming an alliance with the PPP Co-chairman Asif Zardari and get his national and provincial assembly seats.
“But I said that the GDA can't be abolished, then a reply came that the result will be zero. Zero was written in front of the GDA and 15 was written in front of MQM.
“This is not the work of ROs (returning officers). If the entire province was to be handed over to Zardari, then what was the need for an election,” he charged.
“We are not anti-state people. We are because of this country. My father (late Pir Pagara Pir Shah Mardan Shah) always supported the army. He always advised us to go with the army but when you don't get respect and justice, we have the right to protest,” he said.
“We will protest peacefully against this bogus election. We are given two seats in charity? We will return these two seats, Zardari may need them,” he added.
On the occasion, GDA leader Safdar Abbasi announced: “Our two assembly members will not take oath.”
Abbasi said that the alliance would hold a sit-in at the Hyderabad Bypass on Friday. “We will expand the scope of our protest and contact other parties as well. There will be a protest outside the Sindh Assembly on the day of its maiden session.”
Pir Pagara said that the GDA’s protest would be peaceful and within the ambit of the law and no one would stop any ambulance or family cars during the protest.
When asked if the establishment could get angry because of the protest, he said: “When a son gets angry with his father, he leaves the house.”

3,PPP mulls extending an olive branch to PTI,Party might go ahead with PML-N if PTI does not agree,"The Pakistan Peoples Party-Parliamentarian (PPPP), acknowledging the PTI-backed candidates' winning spree, contemplated a potential offer to let the PTI take the lead in forming the central government.
However, if the PTI falters, the party might go ahead with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
The proposal, still waiting for the green light, was discussed as the PTI-linked candidates triumphed in the majority of National Assembly seats. The PPP-P has decided to assemble committees to open negotiations with various political parties.
It's worth noting that PTI-backed candidates ran as independents, while PML-N emerged as the largest party in the polls, followed closely by PPPP.
The PPP-P leadership deliberated on different suggestions and proposals at the PPP-P’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting on Monday evening. Former president Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari chaired the CEC meeting of the party at Zardari House, Islamabad.
All the members of the CEC of the PPP were present in the meeting.

Faryal Talpur, president of PPP’s women's wing, was also present at the meeting of the CEC. In the meeting, the discussion was held regarding the general elections and the future of the country where the members exchanged views on the country’s current political and economic situation.
Members of the CEC of the PPP have made various suggestions regarding the political, economic and governmental situation of the country. The meeting came after PPP leadership decided in principle to work together with PML-N but postponed the final decision in this regard after taking the matter to CEC.

A member of the PPPP’s CEC, while talking to The Express Tribune, shared that the party leadership deliberated upon the current situation arising after people gave a split mandate to the political parties, saying the party had no hesitation in conceding the public mandate given to PTI.
The leader revealed that some members suggested that PTI should be offered to make government and if they can’t then other parties should go ahead with the understanding reached with PML-N leadership.
To a question, he revealed that the CEC did not discuss any proposal where PML-N and PPP should share the PM Office for 3 and 2 years, respectively. He also said that no discussion has so far taken place about who will get what in Centre and provinces, including the key offices like Senate and National Assembly chairmanship and speaker office.
“انتخابات میں ہونے والے بے ضابطگیوں کا جائزہ لے رہے ہیں، الیکشن کے حوالہ سے چاروں صوبوں میں تحفظات ہیں، کمیٹی تشکیل دی جاری ہے جو تمام دیگر سیاسی جماعتوں سے رابطے کرئے گی، سی ای سی کا اجلاس کل بھی جاری رہے گا جس کے بعد حتمی اعلامیہ پیش کیا جائے گا۔”

At the moment, he shared that the focus of the discussion is whether PML-N and PPP should work together or not, saying the rest of the details will be decided afterwards. However, another PPP leader had no hesitation in sharing the real decisions about the upcoming government and who would get what would be taken somewhere else, saying the current deliberations were just eyewash.
The party statement said that the meeting of the CEC began by paying homage to the martyrs of democracy. Moreover, members of the CEC expressed confidence in the leadership of President Asif Ali Zardari and Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.

Briefing the media after the meeting, Senator Sherry Rehman, Vice President PPPP, while being accompanied by Shazia Marri, Faisal Karim Kundi, Sarfaraz Bugti and other fellow leaders, said that the CEC meeting will continue tomorrow.
She extended congratulations to the winning candidates and said that the PPP has decided to form committees to negotiate with other political parties.
