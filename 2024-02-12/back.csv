0,Vawda describes elections as ‘judicial selection’,"He argued that “when you control everything, why blame the establishment?""","Politician Faisal Vawda has described the Feb 8 general elections as a “judicial selection”. He has urged people to understand what are the real problems of the country and the reasons behind its current state of affairs.
“The nation will have to first figure out whose obduracy has brought the country to this juncture,” Vawda said during a discussion at a private TV channel on Sunday.
He said people must find out who was responsible for the disintegration of the country in 1971; who was responsible for the execution of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and who was responsible for keeping PPP Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari behind bars for 14 years with any conviction.
“Who was behind disqualifying [former prime minister] Nawaz Sharif on the basis of Black Law Dictionary and who did not allow him to speak to his ailing wife?” he asked.
Vawda said the need for an inquiry into the manner Imran Khan's government was removed and questioned the legitimacy of the no-confidence motion moved against it.
He stressed the importance of finding those who are responsible for all these things. He argued that “when you control everything, why blame the establishment?” Vawda also discussed the personal life of a former prime minister's wife, drawing an analogy with divorce situations.
He discussed the political scenario, stating that 93 lawmakers in the National Assembly are independent while generally 30 MNAs are elected as independents who join the party that makes the government.
He predicted that in case Nawaz Sharif is directly elected as PM then his government will come to an end in a matter of months. He said this will be the last time the PML-N will come to power.
He said the father-in-law of CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja had remained the principal secretary to Nawaz Sharif during his earlier terms as the premier. “Some of his family members are also currently facing custom cases in courts.”

6,Pakistan condemns Israel’s Rafah ‘massacre’,"Attack violates measures indicated by ICJ to protect people of Gaza from genocide, says FO","Pakistan on Monday joined the rest of the international community to strongly condemn Israel’s latest military offensive in Rafah city in Gaza, where millions have taken refuge to avoid Israeli massacre.
Despite calls even by Israel’s close allies including the United States, Benjamin Netanyahu government went ahead with the offensive.
Dozens of people, including children, were killed as “extremely intense” Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded multiple locations in Rafah overnight Monday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, as international alarm mounts over Israel’s planned ground offensive in the southern Gazan city.
More than 100 people were killed due to Israeli airstrikes as warplanes targeted different areas of the city and helicopters fired machine guns along the border areas, the PRCS said early Monday.

“Israel’s offensive in Rafah violates the provisional measures indicated by the International Court of Justice to protect the people of Gaza from genocide. It will further aggravate the humanitarian disaster witnessed in Gaza over the last four months and jeopardise the ongoing efforts for a potential ceasefire,” said a statement issued by the foreign office.
“We urge the international community, especially the UN Security Council, to take urgent measures to bring an immediate end to Israeli aggression and its incessant crimes against humanity,” the statement added.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Kingdom joined a growing list of countries to express concern over Israel’s planned offensive.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry warned of “very serious repercussions of storming and targeting” the city, while Qatar — a key mediator in talks between Israel and Hamas — on Sunday urged the UN’s Security Council to “prevent” Israel from committing what it described as “genocide” and warned of a “humanitarian catastrophe in the city.”

7,PTI demands CEC’s resignation over ‘poll fraud’,"Alleges ECP members, CEC colluded to strip PTI-backed candidates of mandate bestowed by people","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has demanded the immediate resignation of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, accusing him of dereliction of his constitutional and legal duties and playing the role of a facilitator in what it termed as 'poll fraud.'
The PTI further insisted that not only should CEC Raja step down, but the members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should also tender their resignations.
It alleged that they colluded to strip PTI-backed candidates of the mandate bestowed upon them by the people in the February 8 general elections, marred by widespread reports of vote rigging.
In a statement, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan demanded CEC and ECP members’ resignation amid widespread reports of vote rigging during the recently concluded polls.
According to the PTI, the party was cruising with a lead of 170 National Assembly seats before the alleged rigging swung the pendulum in favour of the PML-N.
Party chairman Barrister Gohar Khan stated that the party intended to use legal avenues to highlight this rigging and get back its stolen mandate.
This is not the first time PTI has demanded resignation from CEC as PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has demanded Raja’s resignation on several occasions in the past as well on the allegation that he had joined hands with the PML-N. Imran had even shown mistrust in CEC after his party’s resounding victory on 15 seats in the by-elections held in 20 constituencies of Punjab in 2022.
On Sunday, the PTI spokesperson demanded the immediate resignation of CEC and members of the election watchdog, “who worked as main facilitators in the daylight robbery on public mandate.”
Hasan said that the CEC and ECP members did not have any right and moral justification to say any more on their position since “they completely failed in performing their constitutional and legal duties”.

He added that they even did not have any regard or respect for the Constitution and law.
He further stated that the CEC and ECP members “opened the door to violating the constitution, flouting the law, tarnishing democracy, and desecrating the public mandate.”
In addition, the spokesperson said that imposing PDM-2 on the nation again through daylight robbery on public mandate is unacceptable and intolerable.
While demanding the immediate resignation of CEC, and ECP members, he said that neither people nor PTI would accept any malicious plot come what may. Hasan strongly rejected the ongoing malicious attempts and “shameful drama to tamper with the results to convert PTI’s overwhelming majority into the minority to impose the people-rejected PDM-2 on the nation once again.”
In a strongly worded statement, Hasan vehemently denounced the reprehensible plot to deprive people of their true and genuine representatives, saying efforts were afoot to allegedly steal the public mandate and re-imposed “the gang of criminals on the nation.”
He made it clear that the people of the country would not accept any such nefarious plan and they would safeguard and protect their mandate come what may.
He stated that PTI, being the largest and most popular party in the country, with representation in all four provinces and a decisive public mandate, had the basic constitutional, democratic, moral and political right to form a government.
He recalled that the “rejected and incompetent PDM group” was responsible for Pakistan’s prevailing economic and administrative disaster. He went on to say that inflation-weary people of the country rejected PTI opponents by taking revenge through their power of vote three days ago by inflicting crushing drubbing on them.
The statement said that the PDM’s 16-month-long inept government compounded the public miseries manifolds, saying they skyrocketed the inflation and ruined the fast-thriving economy.

8,Election marathon ends as ECP unveils party positions,"Independents take lion's share; followed by PML-N, PPP and MQM-P","The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Sunday concluded the gigantic election exercise, with the announcement of the results after counting all the votes cast on Thursday during the polling, issuing the preliminary position of the political parties in the national and provincial assemblies.
Voting was held on 854 national and provincial assembly constituencies. According to the initial results, 348 independents returned successful. Barring a few, the independents belong to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) which was denied its electoral symbol of ‘bat’ due to its controversial intra-party elections.
Among the political parties, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) emerged as the largest party, winning 227 seats, followed by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) with 160 seats. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) is in third place with 45 seats.
In the National Assembly, independents won 101 seats, according to the preliminary results. The PML-N got 75 seats, while the PPP grabbed 54 and the MQM-P secured 17 seats. Among other parties, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) won four seats, PML-Quaid, three, and Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) and the Balochistan National Party (BNP), two each.
Besides one seat each is shared by Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen Pakistan (MWM), Pashtoonkhwa National Awami Party (PNAP), Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party (NP) and PML-Zia.

The election, which was itself much delayed, comes at a pivotal moment.
Pakistan is in an economic crisis, with dwindling foreign currency reserves that will be further strained by a $1 billion bond payment due in two months, while its $3 billion funding programme with the International Monetary Fund expires on April 12.
""Pakistan will be entering into more severe political and economic instability if no party emerges with a simple majority,"" Sajid Amin of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, a former adviser to the Ministry of Finance, said.
""But most important is the credibility of elections and legitimacy of the government - any government which lacks credibility will not be able to deliver on much-needed reforms.""
Securing funding will be a top priority, with the country having not yet fully covered its external financing requirements for 2024 and its nearly $100 billion external debt burden.
A new government is expected to quickly take the necessary steps for example on governance of state-owned enterprises to complete the last remaining review of the current $3 billion IMF Stand-by Arrangement - a bridge loan that helped pull the country back from the brink of default.
Doing so would secure it a final $1.1 billion tranche before the current IMF programme expires in mid-April - with the government then having to secure a follow-up programme straightaway.
