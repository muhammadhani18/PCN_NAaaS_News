0,Western capitals call for probe into election irregularities,"London, Brussels, Washington regret lack of level-playing field, curbs on freedom of expression, access to internet","The Western capitals on Friday called into question the ""undue restrictions"" put in place during the February 8 elections in Pakistan and expressed concern over allegations of vote-rigging, but pledged to work with whoever formed the next government.
The United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, in their separate statements, called upon the relevant Pakistani authorities to ensure a timely and full investigation of all the reported irregularities in Thursday’s elections.
The statements by UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell and the US State Department Spokesperson Mathew Miller condemned all acts of violence in the lead-up to the elections as well as on the polling day.
“We recognise, however, serious concerns raised about the fairness and lack of inclusivity of the elections,” Cameron said. “We regret that not all parties were formally permitted to contest the elections and that legal processes were used to prevent some political leaders from participation, and to prevent the use of recognisable party symbols,” he added.
“We also note the restrictions imposed on internet access on polling day, significant delays to the reporting of results and claims of irregularities in the counting process,” Cameron said in comments, which were echoed in the statements of both Borrell and Miller.
“We regret the lack of a level-playing field due to the inability of some political actors to contest the elections, restrictions to freedom of assembly, freedom of expression both online and offline, restrictions of access to the internet, as well as allegations of severe interference in the electoral process, including arrests of political activists,” Borrell said in his statement in Brussels.
“We therefore call upon the relevant authorities to ensure a timely and full investigation of all reported election irregularities and to implement the recommendations of the upcoming EU Election Expert Mission report,” Borrell added.
Similarly, Miller said in Washington: “We join credible international and local election observers in their assessment that these elections included undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.”
He added: “We condemn electoral violence, restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including attacks on media workers, and restrictions on access to the internet and telecommunication services, and are concerned about allegations of interference in the electoral process. Claims of interference or fraud should be fully investigated.”
“The UK urges authorities in Pakistan to uphold fundamental human rights including free access to information, and the rule of law. This includes the right to a fair trial, through adherence to due process and an independent and transparent judicial system, free from interference,” added Cameron.
The EU, the UK and the US welcomed the increased number of women voters compared to the last elections. “We commend all those who voted,” Cameron said. Miller also noted that millions of Pakistanis made their voices heard by voting on February 8, with record numbers of Pakistani women, members of religious and ethnic minority groups, and youth registered.

“The participation by the Pakistani people to exercise their right to vote, despite systemic barriers still faced by women and persons belonging to minorities, demonstrates their commitment to democracy and the rule of law,” said Borrell. “We commend Pakistani poll workers, civil society, journalists and election observers for their work to uphold Pakistan’s democratic and electoral institutions,” said Miller.
Borrell said that the Pakistani authorities were faced with the challenging task of countering serious terrorist threats and attacks. He called on all parties and actors to use peaceful and democratic mechanisms to settle differences, refraining from further violence.
He underscored the importance to political pluralism, democratic values, independent media, vibrant civil society, judicial independence and international human rights standards, which, he described as the key for democratic elections.
“We call on all political actors in Pakistan to engage in a peaceful and inclusive dialogue aiming at the formation of a stable government and to respect human rights in line with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, as well as with international treaties to which Pakistan is party,” he added.
The EU foreign and security policy chief emphasised that Pakistan was an important partner, and that the EU looked forward to continuing to work with Islamabad on the priorities agreed in the EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan.
“We encourage Pakistan to continue reforms in the areas of human rights, good governance, as well as labour rights and environmental standards, to address the shortcomings outlined in the GSP-Plus report of November 2023, and to continue the necessary economic reforms,” he added.
Miller said that the US awaited complete results, adding that Washington was prepared to work with the coming Pakistani government, regardless of political party, to “advance our shared interests” and to bolster “our partnership by supporting Pakistan’s economy” through trade and investment.
“We will continue to support Pakistan strengthening its democratic institutions, engage through the US-Pakistan Green Alliance Framework, broaden people-to-people ties, and promote human rights including freedom of expression,” he continued.
“We are also committed to strengthening our security cooperation and creating an environment of safety and security that affords the Pakistani people the peace, democracy, and progress they deserve,” the State Department spokesperson added.
Lord Cameron stressed that for a civilian government with the mandate to deliver, crucial reforms were essential for Pakistan to flourish. “The new government must be accountable to the people it serves, and work to represent the interests of all Pakistan’s citizens and communities with equity and justice. We look forward to working with Pakistan’s next government to achieve this.”

1,PML-N opens talks for coalition govt,Nawaz tasks Shehbaz with negotiations with potential allies,"Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif announced on Friday his intentions to form government at the Centre and tasked party president Shehbaz Sharif to open talks with Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) in this regard.
Shortly after Nawaz made the announcement, Shehbaz reportedly held talks with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Co-Chairman Asif Zardari during a meeting held at the Chief Minister House in Lahore. The meeting was also attended by PPP leader Faryal Talpur.
Shahbaz also spoke with MQM Rabita Committee Convenor Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui by telephone and expressed his desire for talks on government formation. Dr Siddiqui assured him that he would consult the party’s Rabita Committee on the matter after the complete election results.
Some PPP leaders have indicated that the party will convene its Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting to discuss the possibility of forming a coalition government. Throughout the election campaign, the PPP had bitterly criticized the PML-N for its poor performance during the previous coalition government.
Nawaz delivered his ""victory speech"" at the PML-N Secretariat in Lahore, despite his party being relegated to the second position, as independent candidates supported by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) emerged as the largest group in the incoming National Assembly after Thursday's vote.
Insiders have revealed that the PPP leadership is pursuing a two-pronged strategy. Firstly, they are bargaining for a better share in the government. Secondly, they are working to rope in the maximum number of independent candidates in Punjab to further consolidate their position.
Previously, senior PPP leader Khursheed Shah reportedly stated that the party would not engage in discussions with PML-N if Nawaz Sharif asserted himself as the prime minister. This implies that the PPP was open to considering a coalition but without Nawaz assuming the role of prime minister.
The PPP, however, has not taken this position officially.

The MQM too has expressed its willingness to the proposition of a coalition government. Dr Siddiqui had said that the MQM would work unconditionally with parties for the sake of the betterment of the people. He added that they had a three-point demand, which they would take to parliament.
Given that PML-N enjoys very good relationship with the JUI-F, an engagement with Maulana Fazlur Rehman would be more of a formality.
Given the PTI's current strained relationship with the establishment, its prospects for returning to government, despite securing an impressive victory in Thursday’s elections, appear very slim.
The government that PML-N is likely to form is anticipated to resemble a rerun of the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) coalition government, which assumed power after the removal of the PTI government through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and remained in office until August 2023.
PML-N tactfully acknowledged its polling position and utilized technicalities to claim victory, as on paper, the party emerged as the single largest political party. This occurred after PTI fielded its candidates as independents following the denial of its electoral symbol.
Nawaz claimed that not only at the Centre, but the PML-N had also emerged as the single largest party in Punjab. He stated that he would have been happier if the party had got a simple majority to form a government at the Centre on its own.

If they had obtained simple majority, Nawaz continued, they would have invited other parties to join them, to form a coalition government. “We will invite PPP, MQM and JUI to join us in forming a government to take Pakistan out of the quagmire it is currently in,” he said.
Emphasising that a collective effort was the need of the hour, Nawaz said he had instructed Shehbaz Sharif to meet Asif Zardari, Maulana Fazl and Dr Siddiqui, adding that he had given the mandate to Shehbaz Sharif and senior party leader Ishaq Dar, who would hold the first meeting on Friday.
Talking about Punjab, Nawaz also dropped a hint that Shehbaz might again become the provincial chief minister, as he said that his role had been commendable. In a lighter vein, he also said that Shehbaz had already started buying laptops for the youngsters.
Responding to a question, he said he wanted to give his speech on Thursday but then the results were still awaited. On Thursday with only 10 to 12% results announced, people formed an opinion which was beyond comprehension, Nawaz added.
Nawaz stressed the need for all parties to sit together and form a government, because the country “cannot afford another round of elections”. He said that all institutions, parliament, judiciary, armed forces and media should play a positive role to take the country out of this quagmire.
The three times former prime minister said that he respected the mandate given to all the parties, even the independent candidates. He added that he invited them also to join the PML-N in taking country out of the crisis.
He said that they should come up to the expectation of the masses. He suggested that a 10-year period of stability was required to put the country on the right track. He added that they had to take the country in the 21 century.
He reminded the people of the services of his party in the past, saying that from defence to financial position, the party had several achievements under their belt. He said that the party had “done this before and will do it again”.

2,PTI repeats 2018 sweep of K-P,"All rival party heads, several heavyweights lost in PTI stronghold"," 
In a near-repeat of the 2018 elections, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which has ruled Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa twice, appeared headed for a clean-sweep, convincingly trouncing all rivals in both National Assembly and Provincial Assembly constituencies in the general elections held on Thursday, according to unofficial, unverified preliminary results.
The results compiled by contestants based on Form-45, political heavyweights of all rival parties of the PTI, including JUI-F, ANP, PML-N, and PPP, appeared to be losing in both the National Assembly and K-P Assembly constituencies.
Besides, those who parted ways with PTI founder Imran Khan, including the former chief ministers Pervaiz Khattak and Mehmood Khan, who formed a separate political party – the PTI-Parliamentarians – are on course to lose the contest, while those who stood with the PTI are emerging victorious.
In the 2018 general elections, PTI founder Imran Khan had won a National Assembly constituency from Bannu. While all other party heads – Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Shehbaz Sharif, Asfandyar Wali Khan, Aftab Sherpao, Sirajul Haq and Maulana Fazlur Rehman – had lost in the province.
Although the final results are pending compilation, unofficial reports indicate a familiar trend unfolding. Barrister Gauhar Khan, Chairman of PTI, contesting as an independent candidate, appears to be on the path to victory.
While the heads of the PTI’s rival political parties, PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif, ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan, JUI-F chief Fazl, and his two sons, QWP chief Sherpao and his son Sikandar, and JI Amir Sirajul Haq were facing defeat.
In initial results, PTI sweeps aside political heavyweights. Among those succumbing to PTI’s electoral dominance is veteran politician Ghulam Ahmed Bilour. While former federal minister Saleem Saifullah emerged victorious, his brother Anwar Saifullah of PPP faced defeat.
PPP K-P President Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, General Secretary Shuja Khan, Information Secretary Amjad Afridi, ANP Information Secretary Samar Haroon Bilor, JUI General Secretary Maulana Ataul Haq, JI K-P Amir Prof Ibrahim and General Secretary Abdul Wasi and Bakht Jahan are also facing defeat.

Meanwhile, the PTI-backed candidates, who contested as independents because the party had lost the election symbol of ‘bat’ due to intra-party elections controversy – are poised to clinch victory for the second, and even third time.
The expected victorious PTI-backed candidates included former National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaisar, K-P Speaker Mushtaq Ghani, former federal ministers Shaheryar Afridi, Ali Muhammad Khan, Ali Amin Gandapur and others.
Similarly, this list is expected to include three grandsons for former president Gen Ayub Khan—Omar Ayub Khan, Akbar Ayub Khan and Arshad Ayub. On the other hand, former president Ghulam Ishaq Khan's one son-in-law Hisham Inamullah and grandson Taimur Saleem Jhagra are on course to victory.
However, Ghulam Ishaq Khan's other son-in-law Anwar Saifullah and granddaughter Samar Haroon Bilour appeared to be losing. But in an interesting bout, Anwar Saifullah’s borther, Salim is expected to avenge his 2013 defeat to Fazl Saleem as he is on way to defeat Fazl’s son Maulana Asjad Mahmood.
The PTI backed, Shandana Gulzar and Mian Umar Jamshed Kakakhel are on course to retain or take back the seats their parents had one held. Shandana’s father Gulzar Khan had won the 2013 general elections from Peshawar on a PTI ticket. Now, Shandana Gulzar is expected to re-take this seat.
Similarly, another PTI-backed independent Mian Jamshed Kakakhel is on course to win in Nowshera. His father Mian Umar Kakakhel’s had won this seat on a PTI ticket in 2013 and 2018 general elections. However, after his death, Mian Umar Kakakhel had lost the by-election to the (PML-N).

3,A clash between tenacity and technology,Delay in announcement of results casts doubt on polls transparency,"Amidst the fervor of the highly contentious elections, the spotlight shifts from the political battleground to the technological arena.
The tale unfolds with a clash between the PTI's resilience and the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) touted Election Management System (EMS) - a clash that will decide the fate of the nation.
With the promise of technological advancement, expectations were high for swift and accurate results. The ECP has heralded its EMS as the emblem of transparency and efficiency in result compilation.
Yet, as the clock struck 2am, the promised unveiling of unofficial results remained elusive, shrouding the election in controversy and reviving the memories of the 2018 election’s Result Transmission System (RTS) debacle.
Despite claims that the new system was capable of working even without the internet, most constituencies – more than 85 percent—awaited their fate, casting doubt on the efficacy of the EMS and transparency of the elections itself.
This setback compounds the existing grievances over an uneven playing field in the pre-election phase, exacerbated by countrywide mobile and internet suspensions under the guise of security concerns throughout the election day.
Nevertheless, amidst the chaos and uncertainty, the PTI emerges as a force to reckon with. Weathering a storm of legal battles, symbol stripping, and communication blackouts, Imran Khan's party asserts its resilience.
Across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI-backed candidates hold sway, solidifying their stronghold in Northern Punjab and challenging the PML-N's dominance in urban centers like Lahore and Faisalabad.
The aftermath of the May 9 blunder saw prominent figures deserting the PTI, spawning splinter groups and leaving the party to rally behind fresh faces.
Read: Hours after polling, nation awaits final results of elections
In a bold move, the PTI allocated 55% of its tickets to newcomers, willingly or unwillingly defying conventional wisdom and paving the way for a new breed of leaders.
In the labyrinth of Punjab's political landscape, the PTI squares off against the PML-N that projected itself as a government in the making in the center and Punjab. In Sindh, the PPP continues winning streak, albeit facing resistance in Karachi, a testament to the city's unique political dynamics.
As expected, Balochistan continued to show mixed mandate.
Throughout Pakistan's tumultuous electoral history, a recurring narrative of favoritism and manipulation has marred the democratic process. From the party-less elections of 1985 to the controversial polls of 2018, the cast of characters may change, but the underlying script remains consistent.
With each cycle, tweaked versions of the same manipulative tactics are deployed to engineer desired outcomes, perpetuating a cycle of distrust and disillusionment. In the latest chapter of this saga, the ECP finds itself under scrutiny as suspicions surrounding the EMS come to fruition.
As the nation eagerly awaited election results, screens outside the district returning officer offices, meant to display real-time updates, served as nothing more than a tantalizing tease for media representatives. Denied access to the inner workings of the electoral process, journalists found themselves relegated to a token ""media room,"" left to ponder the opacity shrouding the proceedings.
Despite concerns raised by skeptics in the media, the EMS was thrust into action without a comprehensive test run, underscoring a disregard for due diligence in the pursuit of expediency.
As delays in result compilation mounted, doubts over the ECP's credibility intensified, casting a long shadow over its constitutional mandate to ensure free and fair elections.
As the dust settles and the nation braces for the final verdict, the clash between the PTI's resilience and the ECP's faltering EMS serves as a stark reminder of the challenges inherent in Pakistan's electoral journey. In this high-stakes drama, the battle for transparency and integrity hangs precariously in the balance, with the fate of the nation teetering on the edge.

4,PTI’s independents surge,"PTI-backed candidates overpower all odds; PML-N, PPP in tough fight","In an unexpected twist, independent candidates supported by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) seemed to be gaining the upper hand in the preliminary results late on Thursday, causing ripples across the political landscape. This surprising turn of events occurred even as the party's founder, Imran Khan, remained incarcerated, and despite the perceived absence of a fair playing field.
However, uncertainty loomed large following the expression of the Pakistani people's will through their votes in the 2024 general elections, particularly amidst a temporary suspension of cellular services due to security concerns just prior to the commencement of voting.
To add insult to injury, despite assurances from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that the election results would be promptly disclosed, not a single constituency's outcome was announced even as the clock struck 2 o'clock. This delay added frustration and uncertainty to an already tense political atmosphere.
However, in the wee hours of Friday, when very few results trickled in, all PTI-backed independents, supporters gathered at the party’s central secretariat and started “victory” celebrations. PTI Chairman Gauhar Khan claimed that its candidates were leading on 150 National Assembly seats.
The late-night results showed, PTI-backed Muhammad Nawaz Khan Allai won NA-13, Battagram, securing 24,657 votes against Rah-e-Haq Party’s Atta Muhammad, who bagged 18,096 votes, while Ali Muhammad Khan got 42,041 votes to beat ANP’s Ahmed Khan Bahadur, who got 13,845 votes in NA-23,Mardan.
Despite the media's ongoing coverage of unofficial and unconfirmed results for both national and provincial assembly seats, the situation remained volatile as the ECP failed to announce a single official result by 2 a.m. on Friday.
Adding to the frustration, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, who had previously declined to request the restoration of mobile phone services, insisting that the ECP system could operate without it, was reported by midnight to attribute the delay in results to the suspension of cellular services.
As the vote-counting process continued up to the filing of this report, media projections indicated that PTI-backed candidates were leading on a significant number of seats out of the total 266 general seats available in the National Assembly.
These projections were shocking, to say the least, for the party of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. However, just like the ECP, the PML-N also remained tight-lipped.
Meanwhile, despite suspension of the mobile phone services, the military’s media wing said that 12 people, including 10 personnel of security forces and law-enforcement agencies, were killed and 39 others injured in 51 attacks in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Apart from the security challenges, polling was held amid allegations of pre-poll manipulation, in the absence of level-playing field and suspension of cellular services across the country. The shutting down of the mobile internet, which depends on cellular services, was slammed by activists and political parties, excluding PML-N, but all their demands to restore signals were met with silence.
Amid a deafening silence by ECP and the PML-N, the PTI leadership was found vocal, seeing the initial results. PTI Chief Organiser Omar Ayub Khan, PTI Parliamentary Leader in the Senate, Barrister Ali Zafar, and PTI Central Secretary Information, Raoof Hasan, thanked the people on behalf of the “PTI chairman-for-life Imran Khan” for speaking via massive turnout despite every possible method employed to undermine the will of the people.

Raoof Hasan, while speaking about the initial results, said that the PTI was leading on 125 National Assembly seats by significant margins, indicating a potential shot at the government formation at the Centre and in at least two provinces.
However, Hasan expressed concern over the reported slowdown in result announcements, suggesting possible efforts to tamper with the outcome, a practice seen in the past. Hasan warned of serious consequences for those allegedly attempting to manipulate election results, emphasising that the PTI and the people of Pakistan would not tolerate such interference.
In a video message shared on PTI’s official Twitter handle, Hasan strongly advised the swift and transparent announcement of the results without any attempts to withhold or tamper with them.
Meanwhile, in a joint statement, they stated that despite the use of the worst state interference in the electoral process and pre-poll rigging, Imran showed Pakistan a new path by expressing his unwavering faith in the Constitution, law and democracy.
Both the leaders expressed serious concerns as polling process in several constituencies across the country, especially in Karachi, were delayed due to constant obstructions.
However, they lauded that the people had shown their full confidence in Imran Khan and his true agenda of “Haqeeqi Azadi” through their power of votes despite the worst pre-election rigging attempts and creating numerous other hurdles.
Omar and Zafar stated that “the preliminary results were very encouraging, which clearly showed that the PTI was taking a convincing lead.”
However, they said that after clear and visible chances of victory of Imran Khan’s candidates in the preliminary results, the process of results got slowdown alarmingly, besides surfacing of reports of closure of the screens in the offices of returning officers, which was very concerning.
They warned that “an attempt to steal people’s mandate through a closed-room conspiracy would have very negative and fatal consequences.”
Even PMLN senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed posted on X that the poll results were probably “the biggest election upset in Pakistan’s political history in the last 50 years,” saying it was extremely important that the ‘February 8 Surprise’ be transformed into an opportunity for a much-needed “Healing Touch” reinforcing National Unity & Stability by respecting Popular Will & Mandate of People of Pakistan! “Repeating mistake of 2018 polls, when Election Commission’s RTS suddenly conked off before midnight, with results withheld,” he said, “would be a recipe for disaster!”
The results were so delayed that ECP appeared to be violating ECP act of 2017 as Section 13 (3) (Establishment of results management system) states that The Returning Officer shall compile the complete provisional results as early as possible and shall communicate these results electronically to the Commission. Provided that if, it adds, for any reason, the results are incomplete by 02:00 a.m. on the day immediately following the polling day, the Returning Officer shall communicate to the Commission provisional results as consolidated till that time along with reasons for the delay, in writing, while listing the polling stations from which results are awaited and thereafter shall send the complete provisional results as soon as compiled but not later than 10:00 a.m.]
The delay on announcing the results frustrated the ECP so much that it had to issue an official statement at 2:32am, directing the all the Provincial Election Commissioners and Returning Officers to declare all the results within the next half an hour otherwise strict action will be taken against them.
