0,Maersk plays down Red Sea boost,Says oversupply will hit profits more than expected this year,"Maersk warned on Thursday that container shipping overcapacity would hit profits more than expected this year and that it didn’t see a major boost from the jump in freight rates due to Red Sea disruptions, hammering its shares.
The warning, which also led the Danish shipping giant to suspend its share buyback programme, is in stark contrast with investors’ recent optimism about the sector.
Container shippers have been among the best-performing stocks in Europe this year as the re-routing of vessels following attacks on shipping by Houthi militants in the Red Sea – a major trade route – has boosted freight rates.
Maersk’s shares were down 17% at 1321 GMT to levels last seen before the Red Sea disruptions started in December. Shares in rival Hapag-Lloyd were around 11% lower.
Maersk, like other shippers, has been diverting vessels on a longer route around Africa, and some analysts had expected extended journey times and higher freight rates would outweigh a big increase in new container ships joining the market.
However, Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc told reporters that about twice as many new vessels were coming to market compared to the extra capacity required to send ships around Africa.
The pandemic boost to shipping profits resulted in a wave of new ship orders. Vessels delivered at the end of last year were used to cover the gaps created by longer sailing around Africa, but the overcapacity will only fully materialise during 2024, and be felt in 2025 and possibly into 2026, Clerc said.
“We will see that there are too many ships in the world compared to the number of containers that need to be transported,” he said. “Even if a year from now we’re still sailing south of Africa, excess capacity and pressure on prices will persist.”
Maersk, viewed as a barometer of world trade, said it expected underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of between $1 billion and $6 billion this year, compared with the $9.6 billion achieved last year.
Analysts in an LSEG poll had on average forecast an EBITDA of $6.6 billion this year. “We assumed guidance would be conservative, but we view these figures as rather pessimistic and within our expectations prior to the Red Sea disruptions,” Jefferies analysts said in a research note.
Analysts at JP Morgan said they expected Red Sea events to boost earnings in the first quarter, but “the general state of overcapacity is likely to return as 2024 progresses” and likely continue into 2025.
Maersk said one-third of its container volumes were impacted by Red Sea disruptions. Last month, the company attempted to resume sailing through the Red Sea.
Clerc said the message from the US Navy was that it currently cannot guarantee safe passage through the area.
“It’s not going to be the case that just because nothing has happened there for a week, we can try again,” he said. “We need to be sure that the day we return to the Red Sea, it’s because we believe we can do it permanently.”
Clerc said the Red Sea crisis did not match the scale of disruption caused by the pandemic, when freight rates and shippers’ profits were bolstered by multiple shocks, including lockdowns, changing consumer behaviour and bottlenecks.
“In this case, it’s only a longer transit time,” he said. “The moment we start sailing via the Suez Canal again, prices will fall immediately.”

1,Spain’s paella rice could ‘disappear’,Farmers protest EU environmental rules against use of pesticide,"A Spanish rice variety traditionally used to make paella is under threat from a fungus after the European Union banned a pesticide farmers said they relied upon, in another example of how the bloc’s environmental rules are angering growers.
Three rice producers in the Valencia region said their harvest of arroz bomba, or bomb rice, a variety grown almost exclusively in Spain, was half the 10-year average in 2023 as a result of the Pyricularia fungus which causes rice blast disease.
Bomba rice “is very likely to disappear,” said Miguel Minguet, a rice farmer in the Albufera Natural Park in Valencia. “Our crop is going to be lost to regulations.”
Meanwhile, major exporters such as Brazil, India and Cambodia are widely using the pesticide to protect their own crops.
Farmers across Europe have staged angry protests against the EU over restrictions they say hand an advantage to outside competitors. Spanish farmers have been protesting across the country this week.

The clashes are exposing the EU’s struggle to reconcile its sustainability drive with its aim of becoming more self-sufficient in food production amid disrupted supply chains.
The European Commission has been forced to backpedal, with President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday proposing the withdrawal of the EU’s plan to halve the use of pesticides.
The EU in 2018 stopped authorising tricyclazole because it ruled it could be harmful to human health
It had been relied upon for 40 years to combat the fungus affecting bomba rice in Spain’s wetlands, the farmers said.
What angers farmers perhaps the most is that the EU still allows imports to have small traces of the fungicide.

3,Entrepreneurs seek ethical AI use,Local innovators highlight need for regulations to harness AI’s potential safely,"Stringent regulatory policies and rules against the misuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could ensure a responsible and ethical technology culture among Pakistani youths, say AI coaches and entrepreneurs. They add that local bright youth could fully tap into AI to earn remotely with hands-on projects. They stress that it is high time to establish such rules as AI rapidly penetrates all fields and sectors.
Sharing their views with The Express Tribune, they state that preventing youths from misusing AI is crucial and should be approached through three facets. Firstly, comprehensive educational programmes should raise awareness about ethical implications and consequences, aiming to prevent youths from relying on AI technologies like ChatGPT for ready-made answers to assignment questions. Secondly, fostering an environment that values originality and critical thinking is essential, promoting honest academic practices. Lastly, it is advisable to implement advanced plagiarism detection and proctoring tools, leveraging technology to maintain authenticity.
“It is vital to address concerns around AI-generated fake content. I advocate for a regulatory approach that fosters innovation while managing risks. We propose measures such as mandatory disclosure, ethical guidelines, and user awareness initiatives, along with collaboration with the tech industry. Striking a balance is crucial to prevent harm without hindering AI’s positive impact in sectors like education and healthcare. It’s imperative to involve diverse stakeholders in a consultative process to tailor regulations effectively for Pakistan’s unique landscape, promoting responsible AI practices and transparency,” said Entrepreneur and technology expert Salman Lakhani, who is also the founder and CEO of Cubix.

Lakhani highlights that local bright youth can fully tap into AI to earn remotely with hands-on projects. In marketing, AI tools can be used to dig into data and craft personalised campaigns that truly hit the mark. When it comes to graphic design, one can experiment with AI-driven graphic design platforms. For tech enthusiasts, diving into the world of AI-based automation and data processing in software development can be highly rewarding. He highlighted the importance of young Pakistani talent enrolling in online courses, engaging actively in AI communities, and contributing to real-world projects. By developing a versatile skill set, staying updated on industry trends, and offering AI-based solutions on freelancing platforms, recent graduates can access numerous remote opportunities, allowing them to thrive in Pakistan’s dynamic digital landscape.
“Discouraging the misuse of AI among youths calls for a multifaceted approach, including stressing ethical education, promoting digital literacy, and implementing technological safeguards. By adopting these strategies, educators, policymakers, and communities can work together to ensure that AI technologies like ChatGPT are leveraged to enhance learning and creativity among youths, rather than diminish the value of authentic academic endeavour,” said SI Global Solutions CEO Noman Said.
Said highlighted that fresh graduates can effectively learn and polish their AI skills from home by leveraging a wealth of online resources and self-directed learning strategies. These include online courses and tutorials, open-source projects, competitive programming, online forums and communities, research papers and blogs, personal projects, webinars and workshops, YouTube channels, podcasts, and audiobooks. By combining these resources with a disciplined, self-motivated learning approach, fresh graduates can significantly enhance their AI skills from home, he said, adding that it is important to set clear learning goals, maintain a regular study schedule, and actively seek feedback and collaboration opportunities to maximise the learning experience.
Meanwhile, other IT and AI trainers underscore the need for stringent regulatory oversight to mitigate the proliferation of counterfeit multimedia content in Pakistan’s burgeoning IT industry. As AI technologies evolve, they become increasingly adept at generating deceptive videos, audios, and texts, posing significant challenges to information integrity and national security. They stress that implementing such measures is imperative to ensuring the responsible utilisation of AI, protecting citizens from digital disinformation, and securing the integrity of the digital landscape in Pakistan.

4,Govt to permit re-export of oil by foreign suppliers,"Move aims to streamline trade processes, involves amendments to Customs Rules, 2001","The federal government has announced plans to permit the import, local sale, and re-export of petroleum products facilitated by foreign suppliers. This decision, aimed at streamlining trade processes, involves amendments to the Customs Rules, 2001, introducing the Customs Bonded Facilitation Rules, 2024.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has initiated amendments to the Customs Rules, 2001, incorporating the Customs Bonded Facilitation Rules, 2024, according to documents available to The Express Tribune. Stakeholders are currently being consulted, with a 15-day window provided for opinions, suggestions, and objections. Any submissions beyond this timeframe will not be considered, with the amended rules slated for enforcement through a gazette notification.
Under the proposed amendments, a new chapter, Chapter XLV, will be added to the Customs Rules, 2001, specifically catering to international oil suppliers. These rules will enable the import of petroleum products on behalf of foreign suppliers, their subsequent sale in the domestic market, and re-exportation to other countries, aligning with government policy directives.
For this, foreign oil suppliers will have the option to establish their own registered businesses in Pakistan or operate through registered subsidiaries. Additionally, they may opt to import petroleum products through their subsidiaries, supplying domestically and re-exporting from Pakistan. The proposed rules also outline provisions for international suppliers to maintain inventory in customs bonded warehouses across Pakistan, facilitating local sales or re-exports without formal exchange.

Should international oil suppliers choose to operate through a subsidiary registered in Pakistan, adherence to FBR registration and the possession of a Pakistani bank account are mandatory. Furthermore, obtaining a storage license from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) is required for those wishing to establish independent storage facilities in Pakistan.
To ensure compliance and security, the proposed amendments necessitate the provision of post-dated checks as security bonds for the import, local sale, and re-exportation of petroleum products. Assessing officers will oversee the fulfilment of these obligations.

5,Audit reveals officers’ earnings from SOE,"Flags lack of transparency in board fees, recommends inquiry into 60 SOEs","The Auditor General of Pakistan has raised a serious observation on the real incomes and tax contributions of dozens of officers of the Ministry of Finance who are serving on the boards of 60 state-owned companies, yet there are no traces of their earnings from these firms.
The federal auditor – the country’s public exchequer’s watchdog – has framed an objection while performing an audit of the Ministry of Finance for the fiscal year 2022-23 and the audit year 2024. According to the record provided to the AGP, there were 60 State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) where the officers of the Finance Division were represented as board of directors.
Although the AGP does not provide the amount of fee for attending a board meeting in its audit objection, the officers of the finance ministry earn anywhere from as low as Rs25,000 per person per meeting to as high as Rs1.5 million or $5,000 per board attendance.
Under the income tax law, 20% of the board fee has to be paid in income tax, according to the federal auditors. The AGP has shed light on an issue that the Ministry of Finance has long been pushing under the carpet. The non-disclosure of the fees and memberships has diverted attention from the role of the Ministry of Finance in the poor performance of the SOEs and also their actual earnings, which sometimes exceed their annual salaries.
Officers of the Finance Division ranging from deputy secretaries, joint secretaries, additional secretaries to secretaries are members of more than one board at a time. Sometimes, these board meetings are arranged merely as an excuse for officials to visit their hometown at the public exchequer, according to sources. Last month’s report of the Ministry of Finance on the SOEs’ performance revealed that the SOEs caused more than Rs730 billion in losses in fiscal year 2022.
The federal audit report, which has not yet been submitted to Parliament, revealed that there was no centralised record available in the Finance Division related to the approvals, meetings, fees, and remuneration to the officers nominated by the Finance Division were provided to the audit department.
The documents further stated that there were 16 wings working under the Ministry of Finance but only four wings’ list was provided to the auditors. The Ministry of Finance was reluctant to provide the details of the officers of the other 12 wings to the auditors.

The AGP report further stated that there were also no details of the amount paid as remuneration to the members and income tax deducted.
“Audit is of the view that non-maintenance of payment details of remuneration to the members from Finance Division and non-deduction of tax not only caused loss to the public exchequer but is also a serious lapse on the part of the management,” according to the federal auditors.
The Express Tribune talked with some of the board members of the SOEs belonging to the finance ministry. They said that the concerned government company deducts the income tax and disburses only net payment to them.
In some cases, these companies pay full amounts to the board directors and deposit the tax from the company’s kitty, which is a misuse of public resources. This practice is common in case of large companies, some of them paying fees in foreign currency to their board members, the sources added.
The bureaucracy has long been misusing public resources. These bureaucrats ask the management of these companies to arrange meetings in foreign destinations, like Amsterdam, London, Paris, New York, and Dubai to have foreign trips in the name of attending the board meetings, said the sources. During their foreign trips, the concerned government-owned company bears the cost of international traveling, lodging, residence and also provides chauffeur-driven cars to the board directors, said the sources.
The Finance Division has given a reply to the auditors, which they have rejected. According to the reply, the Finance Division only nominates the officers as directors on different boards of SOEs; however, the remuneration and board fee are not paid by the division or from the government account. The Finance Division further argues that as the fee is paid by the concerned government-owned company, therefore, the details of board fees are available with these firms.
But the AGP has rejected the reply on the grounds that the Finance Division nominates officers on different boards and these members are officially nominated and working on behalf of the Finance Division, thus, the account of remuneration is required to be managed by the Finance Division.

7,Baqir urges new govt to tackle 'economic hurdles',Stresses need to address sustainability of Pakistan’s debt,"As Pakistan eagerly awaits the outcome of its 2024 elections, the nation finds itself at a critical juncture, grappling with economic challenges that have long plagued its stability. Former central bank governor, Reza Baqir, highlighted the pressing need for sustainable economic policies in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV, underscoring Pakistan’s daunting debt burden and the imperative of restoring investor confidence.
With ballots being tallied, citizens from all walks of life are looking to the incoming government with renewed hope, yearning for policies that will alleviate inflation and stimulate economic growth. 
“Pakistan’s new government will need to start negotiations early for a new loan package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the country has ‘significant’ payments due to the global lender,” said the former central bank governor. Baqir underscored the significance of Pakistan’s relationship with the IMF and the urgent need to curb inflation, which has soared to unprecedented levels of 30-40%.
“In my view, the number one priority has to be how to protect the poor from the very high inflation that Pakistan has seen over the last couple of years. Headline inflation of around 30%, food inflation of 40%. These are unprecedented levels in decades,” he said, adding that, “I think the number one challenge is going to be how to put the economy on a sustainable footing and how to manage its relationship with the IMF,” said the former SBP governor. 
Read Stocks surge on debt settlement talk
Speaking about what conditions Pakistan will have to fulfill in order to secure the next IMF programme, Baqir highlighted the need for ownership of the reform program. “The first goal is going to be how does Pakistan make a more equitable tax system? How does Pakistan bring into the tax net people and privileged classes, who have avoided taxes instead of continuing to squeeze those in the middle class and the salary-earning people? How Pakistan can broaden its base? These are fundamental questions of ownership, and if the new government generates the ownership around the reform momentum and is less seen as dictated from above by the IMF, the chances of it being sustainable are going to be much higher,” he said.

8,Balochistan installs modern solar facilities,"Province has solar energy potential of 2,900 gigawatts","Balochistan Caretaker Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Khan Domki has inaugurated an extensive solarisation project to shift various public department buildings including educational institutions, healthcare facilities and civic departments onto renewable energy that will provide clean, affordable and uninterrupted power supply to public facilities in the province.
The Balochistan government, with the support of Chinese government, has completed the solarisation of 12 educational institutions, computer labs and hospitals that have been equipped with modern solar power facilities.
Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong participated in the inaugural ceremony where he expressed his views through a video link at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.
Pakistan’s total installed solar energy capacity was 1.24 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, representing a 17% increase over 2021. The government has proposed many initiatives to increase the share of solar energy.
By now, the country’s solar energy market is estimated to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.68% from 1.30 giga tonnes in 2023 to 9.77 giga tonnes in 2028.
In the specific case of Balochistan, according to the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation programme, Pakistan’s total technical solar and wind potential stands at 2,900 GW and 340 GW, respectively.

Additionally, Balochistan has the potential to implement greater than 14 GW of renewable energy projects within five to 10 years through least-cost pathways, including photovoltaic (PV) utility-scale plants of 9,500 to 11,500 megawatts.
Balochistan’s geography, irradiance and location make it one of Pakistan’s most high-potential provinces, with respect to renewables. Decentralised micro-grids paired with solar generation could be used to increase reliable electricity access to rural residents.
While micro-grids generally only provide basic electrification (high quality lighting and charging of mobile phones), it is able to do so for multiple households at a significantly lower cost in the long run. An estimated 36% of Balochistan is electrified, so this pairing has immense potential for the province. In the future, the province is poised to become the country’s most booming solar power hub.

9,Bonds rise on economic optimism,Become world’s best-performing driven by high hopes ahead of new govt,"Pakistan’s US dollar-denominated Eurobonds and Sukuks have emerged as some of the world’s best-performing bonds in global markets, driven by optimism surrounding the nation’s domestic macroeconomics amidst the ongoing elections to elect new political governments at the centre and in the provinces on Thursday.
The robust rally in these bonds indicates a restoration of foreign investors’ confidence in Pakistan and its future government, which is widely anticipated to unveil a new economic roadmap aimed at addressing the nation’s current economic and financing crises, particularly enhancing its capacity to make foreign debt repayments on time.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that the price of Pakistan’s 10-year Eurobond, valued at $1 billion and maturing in three months on April 15, 2024, surged to a record high of 98.11 cents on February 7, 2024. The bond, which had traded below 50 cents in June 2023, almost halving its face value of $1, has now rebounded significantly, reaching an exit price of 98.11 cents, it was learnt.
Currently, global traders have invested approximately $7.80 billion in Pakistan’s foreign Eurobonds and Sukuks, with maturity dates ranging from April 2024 to April 2051.
The price of Pakistan’s upcoming 10-year Eurobond, valued at $500 million and maturing on September 30, 2025, rose to 87.81 cents from around 40 cents in June.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Tahir Abbas, Head of Research at AHL, commented, “The Eurobond price has doubled in the past seven months, emerging as one of the best-performing bonds in global markets.”
The surge in Eurobonds, especially those maturing in April, is attributed to three key factors: the ongoing general elections, anticipation of the new government securing a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme after the current $3 billion programme concludes in March 2024, and expectations of the central bank cutting its benchmark policy rate by around 7 percentage points to 15% by the end of December 2024, he said.
These developments are expected to create a conducive environment for economic growth, industrial revival, and the creation of new job opportunities.
Read Pakistan’s Eurobonds jump to multi-year highs
Abbas noted that bond prices have continued to rise over the past seven months (July to date), with the rebound beginning after the previous government secured the $3 billion IMF loan programme in late June 2023.
Following the completion of the first economic review of the programme in November 2023, the IMF released the second loan tranche of $700 million in January 2024, affirming Pakistan’s compliance with programme conditions.
Abbas highlighted that Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have doubled to over $8 billion compared to less than $4 billion in June 2023, enabling the government to smoothly repay $1 billion to Eurobond global investors on April 15, 2024. Despite facing a foreign exchange reserves crisis, the country successfully repaid $1 billion to foreign investors days before the previous Eurobond matured in December 2022.
In a recent development, global credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings hinted at a potential upgrade to Pakistan’s credit rating to ‘B’ once the new government assumes power, subject to its economic policies and reform efforts. Currently rated ‘CCC+’ by the agency, Pakistan’s credit outlook depends on its ability to secure a new IMF loan programme and ensure timely debt repayments, while fostering economic expansion. The agency will in particular be watching the next government’s moves on approaching the IMF and securing a new loan programme, which will ensure that the country continues to repay foreign debt on time and allows gradual expansion of its economic activities throughout this fiscal year (FY24) and beyond.
Abbas highlighted that global investors will closely monitor the new government’s economic measures, particularly its efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in export-led sectors, expand the taxpayer base, enhance tax revenue collection, and create fiscal space for economic activities.
