0,Déjà vu in K-P,2024 polls prove a nightmare for parties," 
For all other political parties apart from the PTI, the general elections of 2024 also proved to be a nightmare – similar to what happened in 2018.

Only the leaders of PTI achieved success in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, while those of all other parties faced defeat.

Apart from those who left the PTI and joined other parties, former K-P chief ministers Pervez Khattak and Mahmood Khan, who formed their own party called PTI-Parliamentarians, also suffered failure.

Those who persevered with the PTI and faced hardships were rewarded in the form of success in the polls.

In the 2018 general elections, Imran Khan, the founding chairman of the PTI, emerged victorious from K-P, but all other national leaders were defeated, including PML-N president and former premier Shehbaz Sharif, PPP chairman and ex-foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, ANP chief Asfandyar Wali Khan, Qaumi Watan Party head Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, Jamaat-e-Islami emir Sirajul Haq and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.

This time again, PTI leader Barrister Gohar on way to success in the province while others including PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif; ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan; the JUI-F chief and his two sons; QWP’s Sherpao and his son Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao; JI emir; and all others apparently tested defeat.

Even former federal minister and senior politician, ANP’s Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, faced defeat.
However, former federal minister PML-Q’s Salim Saifullah Khan was successful in clinching his seat but his brother, ex-PPP K-P president Anwar Saifullah Khan was not so fortunate.

PPP K-P president Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha and general secretary Shuja Khan; ANP provincial information secretary Samar Haroon Bilour; JUI-F provincial general secretary Molana Attaul Haq Darvish; and JI provincial emir Professor Muhammad Ibrahim Khan as well as general secretary Abdul Wasey also failed to bag the seats they were running for.

Among those defeated in the elections is PPP K-P information secretary Amjad Afridi, who had been consistently successful in the previous polls.

On the other hand, PTI-affiliated independent candidates were successful yet again including former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser; ex-KP Assembly speaker Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani; as well as former federal ministers Shehryar Afridi, Ali Muhammad Khan, and Ali Amin Gandapur.

Former K-P Assembly speaker Bakht Jehan Khan, who is contesting the election on the ticket of JI from Buner, has suffered defeat as well.

1,ECP told to put NA-128 results on hold,LHC suspends RO’s Form-47 prepared in contestant’s absence,"Lahore High Court’s Justice Ali Baqar Najafi on Friday temporarily restrained the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from announcing the results of NA-128 on his plea filed by PTI-backed independent candidate Salman Akram Raja, the ‘runner-up’, who challenged his eviction from the premises where the returning officer (RO) of the constituency was preparing the Form-47, the operation of which was suspended by the judge.
“The [ECP] shall not give effect to the Form-47 under Rule 84 (1) of provisional consolidated result of NA-128 (Lahore) prepared in absence of the petitioner or his agent,” the court order read.
The judge also directed the ECP to take notice of the conduct of the RO, who was summoned before the LHC but his absence before the court was ‘conspicuous’.
The court issuing notices sought replies from the ECP, RO, Lahore police chief, Model Town SP and ‘successful’ candidate Awn Chaudry of the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party by February 12.
Petitioner Raja had challenged in the LHC his “illegal” eviction from the RO’s office by police officials on his orders, depriving him of the right to observe the process of consolidation of the election’s results and match the Form-47 with the record he had received from his polling agents.
As the proceedings commenced, the petitioner’s lawyer, Barrister Sameer Khosa, contended that his client was forcefully evicted from the premises of the RO’s office after the results of 30 polling stations reached there, giving a clear signal that the petitioner was set to win the election for NA-128 by a “very large margin”.
As the ECP lawyer dispelled the impression that Raja was evicted from the office, Justice Najafi asked him was he in an admitted position that the petitioner was present that time when the results of the constituency were being consolidated.
To this, the ECP lawyer refused to admit it. However, he added that runner-up candidates used such tactics when they saw their defeat.
The ECP lawyer evaded the queries put forth by Justice Najafi that why only a single contestant was evicted in response to the law and  order situation; why the process of consolidating the results was not stopped, and why it was not resumed in presence of the candidates after the problem was brought under control.
Justice Najafi adjourned the proceedings for short time, ordering the RO to appear before the court.
After proceedings resumed, the ECP lawyer told the court that the RO had not turned up and his mobile phone was switched off.
He added that after sending the results to the ECP, the RO went home.

The ECP lawyer argued that the petitioner could not check the Form-47 from the RO, requesting the court to dismiss the plea as not maintainable.
He argued that the petitioner should have contacted the ECP first against the process of counting.
The petitioner’s lawyer argued that their matter was not related to the process of counting votes, but it was about how a candidate could be deprived of their right of observing the process of consolidation of results.
Petitioner Raja was evicted from the premises of the RO’s office by the Model Town SP. The RO’s order alluded to an incident that lasted a few minutes wherein certain miscreants holding stick were allowed by the police to enter the lawn of the premises.
The lawyer contended that the commotion was caused overcome in a few minutes.
Thereafter, he added that the process of the receipt of results from the presiding officers continued unhindered.
He argued that there was no reason for the eviction of his client.
The RO had requested the Lahore police chief that no candidate, their agents, media teams and any other person should be allowed into his camp office for NA-128 at Govt Girls High School Shuhada-e-APS E-Block Model Town, Lahore as they caused a law and order situation.
The RO maintained that the working condition inside the premises had become impossible because of the aggressive behaviour of the candidates and their agents.
He sought police assistance to safeguard the staff working inside the premises and also for the safety of the incoming polling material to complete whole process smoothly.

2,Voting ‘more important’ than internet access,C’Wealth observers group head expresses satisfaction with the electoral process,"Former Nigerian president Dr Goodluck Jonathan said on Thursday that elections and voting processes had historically functioned without internet dependency, as he visits various polling stations in Islamabad during the general elections.

Leading a 25-member Commonwealth Observers Group, Dr Jonathan stated that the elections had been being conducted even before the availability of the internet access and stressed that casting votes was more important than the availability of internet connectivity.

Various foreign observers, journalists, and stakeholders have been invited by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). During the voting, the Commonwealth Observers Group visited various polling stations in Islamabad, including those in constituency NA-47.

Speaking to the media, Dr Jonathan said that they were satisfied with the polling process. In response to a question, he said that the purpose of their visit was to monitor the electoral process.

Meanwhile, another delegation of the Japanese Overseer group also visited a polling station in NA-48 Islamabad.

The ECP had invited foreign observers and media personnel in a move that promised transparency and open access. The ECP’s had instructed the presiding officers to refrain from barring the entry of media personnel and observers who bear the ECP’s accreditation.

“This signifies a proactive effort by the ECP to foster an environment of openness during the electoral process,” an ECP spokesperson said. “Whether armed with cameras, notebooks, or a keen eye for detail, those possessing the ECP’s accreditation are assured a seamless entry” into the polling stations.

3,Envoy urges Pakistan-India nuclear confidence talks,Ambassador to US calls for dialogue to resolve Kashmir dispute,"Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Masood Khan has termed Kashmir a “flashpoint” amid tensions between nuclear-tipped India and Pakistan, saying that the two countries should not only discuss their decades-old dispute but also negotiate nuclear confidence-building measures.

In an interview with Newsweek – a weekly American weekly magazine – the ambassador emphasised that India might think that it had taken care of the Kashmir issue but the Kashmiris did not think in that way and nor did the Pakistani people.

“I think that, realistically speaking, we should have talks not only on the future of Jammu and Kashmir and the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir… but we should also have nuclear confidence-building talks, so that we establish reliable communication channels,” he said.

Newsweek correspondent Tom O’Connor, who interviewed the ambassador amid Israeli war on Gaza, wrote that the presence of weapons of mass destruction on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) in the region, added another dimension to the conflict.

He cited Ambassador Masood Khan as arguing that it needed to be addressed by Islamabad and New Delhi to avoid a major crisis, intended or otherwise. “As two responsible nuclear weapons states, we must resolve outstanding disputes in Kashmir,” he said.

“India and Pakistan should have some sense of where we are, what our capabilities are, what our intentions are, as a matter of fact, and so that our entire approach to the region is not accident-prone,” the ambassador added.

The Newsweek pointed out that the Pakistani officials had often lamented a lack of international attention to the Kashmir issue, where New Delhi carried out a mass crackdown since Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked the region’s semi-autonomous status in August 2019.

“We would say that attention from Kashmir is moving away because of Ukraine or the preoccupation of the Western world with China as a competitor, as a challenger to the existing order, and so on,” Masood said. “Now, in addition to Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific politics, you have the Middle East,” he added.

”So, Kashmir is no more on the radar screen of the international community, and yet the oppression continues there,” he continued. “This is very perilous for the international community because the Kashmiris’ freedoms are as sacrosanct as the freedoms of any peoples in any part of the world.”

Pakistani officials have often drawn connections between the Kashmir dispute and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, owing to some common historical roots. Newsweek report said that Ambassador Masood Khan also referenced these commonalities, but also the dissimilarity.

For the rest of the world, the ambassador noted, the war on terror had come to an end, but it was not for Pakistan. Now, he hoped to continue to build more substantive ties between the two nations, based not only on security but also in various other fields such as investment, education and climate change.

“At least, this is our endeavour, that India’s close ties with the United States should not negatively impact our relations with the United States, And similarly, we’ve been assuring Americans here that our relations with China are not at the expense of the United States,” the ambassador said.

4,PTI’s Raoof has no doubt about independents loyalty,Says PTI emerged largest party as people roared their approval for Imran Khan to be next premier,"With the PTI-backed independent candidates springing up surprise victories in the general elections held a day earlier, its central information secretary Raoof Hasan on Friday expressed his confidence that they would not switch their loyalties and the party would be in position to form its governments in three regions of the country -- the Centre, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab.
Addressing a hurriedly called news conference in Islamabad, Hasan maintained that retaliation was not part of his party’s manifesto, but pledged to take legal action against alleged polls rigging, particularly in the results including the possibility of knocking on the doors of election tribunals.
“We will receive the rights granted to us by the Constitution and law in the post-election phase,” he added.
The PTI leader pointed out that his party-backed independent candidates were in the lead in the National Assembly and provincial legislature seats until late in the day, but the transmission of results were was halted after midnight, adding that they were changed after that.
He claimed that those in a winning position had lost and those who were losing had emerged victorious.
“If this is not tampering with the results, then what is?”

The PTI leader accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of tampering with the results.
He demanded that the alleged tampering of the results on February 8 and 9 should be investigated.
In addition, the PTI leader said it was the party’s old demand that an impartial inquiry should be conducted into last year’s May 9 violence.
Hasan said highlighted the PTI’s sweeping lead in K-P and its continuous victories in Punjab.
The PTI leader said it was the culture in the country to buy the loyalties of the winning independent candidates.

He added that PPP Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari was an “expert” in this department but the PTI-backed victorious candidates would remain loyal to their party.
Hasan extended his gratitude to the people of Pakistan for their unwavering support during the recently concluded elections. He took the opportunity to express appreciation for the overwhelming backing received by the party from constituents across the country.
He maintained that political space for the PTI was shrinking in the country since the ouster of its government.
Hasan commended the resilience of the PTI activists, who continued to stick to the party despite facing various forms of oppression. He also lauded the bold participation of PTI supporters in the polling process.

5,Water scarcity sparks dam project scrutiny,Ministry of Water Resources once again addresses crisis caused by Neelum-Jhelum project,"The Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR) has once again addressed the issue of water shortage caused in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) capital after the completion of the 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHPP) in a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Energy.

The NJHPP is a run-of-the-river hydropower project that started electricity generation in April 2018. It diverts the River Neelum through a system of tunnels out-falling into the River Jhelum.

A technical fault in the design of the project has led to a serious water shortage in Muzaffarabad city, in addition to creating environmental issues.

Sources told The Express Tribune that the then AJK prime minister had addressed the matter with the then Pakistani prime minister in a letter written on September 07, 2018.

The two prime ministers had met on October 09, 2018, to discuss the issue.

Later, the Pakistani PM had directed MoWR secretary to furnish a report in consultation with Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) chairman and the AJK government after jointly visiting the NIHPP along with relevant technical officials and verifying the actual discharge downstream.

Afterwards, the MoWR furnished its report initially to the Prime Minister's Office and subsequently on the directions of the Prime Minister's Office to the Cabinet Committee on Energy.

The Cabinet Committee on Energy on August 28, 2019, approved recommendations made in the report.

Among other things, the report had recommended carrying out a comprehensive environmental study to determine the e-flow along the lines of the study conducted by the Government of Pakistan for contesting its case against India's Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant.

The study was to be conducted by hiring international consultants of repute. The committee had noted that there would be no change in the scope or cost of the project.

It had also directed MoWR to submit its recommendations to the relevant forum—Departmental Development Working Party (DDWP)—for further implementation.

The sources said the MoWR presented this issue again in a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Energy. The ministry briefed the committee that pursuant to the diversion of the River Neelum, the downstream river flows reduced drastically down to Muzaffarabad City.

This reduction in flows unleashed several adverse environmental impacts in terms of the deterioration of the river water quality and reduction in water supply for Muzaffarabad city.

The Cabinet Committee on Energy once again directed the ministry to carry out the study.

The NJHPP had experienced a fault in 2022 and remained shut for one year. In August 2023, it restarted generating electricity again following the completion of the restoration work in its tail race tunnel.

According to a report, a fault had developed in the Neelum-Jhelum plant on July 4, 2022, leaving the powerhouse dysfunctional. The project was commissioned in 2018 and had since been working satisfactorily with power generation of 18.28 billion units.

6,"Elections held transparently, peacefully: CEC",Sikandar Sultan Raja claimed that election results will be accepted by all,"The country’s chief election commissioner (CEC) has asserted that the general elections were conducted with 100% transparency, expressing confidence that the election results will be accepted by all individuals and parties.

“The election process was transparent and peaceful, with polling proceeding without any interruptions, and no citizen was prevented from casting their vote,” Sikandar Sultan Raja said on Thursday while addressing the media outside the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) building in the federal capital.

Referring to the closure of telephone and internet services in various parts of the country, he said in areas affected by such closures, the concerned presiding officers will personally deliver Form 45 to the returning officer (RO).

“The form will automatically be received by the RO after it is uploaded in the Election Management System (EMS) once the service is restored,” he clarified.

Raja stated that the ROs are required to announce the results by 2 am on Friday, although announcements may occur earlier if possible.

He said if an extension is requested by two o'clock, it can be granted according to the law. “Time was extended at three polling stations in Gujarat because the relevant ROs had requested it,” he noted.

Regarding the closure of mobile phone and internet services due to security threats, Raja clarified that the ECP’s mandate does not include issuing directives for their restoration. However, he assured that the internet shutdown would not affect the ECP system.

""The commission stands fully prepared. The elections will be fair and transparent. Voters should freely cast their votes for the candidate of their choice. Elections are a national obligation, and we all should play our part. The ECP is as robust as before,” he affirmed.

He said the decision to shut mobile phone and internet services was made by the security institution in response to recent terrorism incidents in Balochistan.

“The commission can make recommendations but cannot interfere in security matters. We will not issue directives for the restoration of telephone and internet services,” he stated, adding that he learned about the closure of these services through the media.

7,Public’s poll participation reflects confidence in Imran: PTI,"Says Imran remained committed steadfast to constitutional principles, legality, and democratic norms","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has expressed gratitude to the people for “actively participating” in the electoral process.

In a joint statement on Thursday, PTI Chief Organiser Umar Ayub Khan and Parliamentary Leader in Senate Barrister Ali Zafar conveyed appreciation on behalf of Imran, who is currently detained in Addiala Jail.

Observing that the state entities had caused “notable interference” and “pre-election manipulation”, they hailed the PTI founding chairman, saying Imran Khan remained committed “steadfast” to constitutional principles, legality, and democratic norms, setting a new benchmark for Pakistan.

They acknowledged delays and disruptions at polling stations in various constituencies, particularly in Karachi, and attributed them to external factors hindering the voting process.

Nevertheless, despite formidable challenges, the populace has shown unwavering confidence in Imran Khan's vision for genuine freedom through their votes, asserted Umar Ayub Khan and Barrister Ali Zafar.

Both the leaders underscored optimistic preliminary results, with PTI candidates “leading convincingly in several constituencies. However, concerns have been raised regarding a noticeable slowdown in the announcement of final results, alongside reports of screen closures at returning officers' offices in several areas, the statement read.

Warning against undermining the people's mandate through clandestine maneuvers, Umar Ayub Khan and Barrister Ali Zafar emphasised the potential dire consequences of such actions.

Without naming Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif, the PTI maintained that a “failed fugitive” had returned under “state patronage” through the London plan to secure victory in both contested seats along with his party's broader electoral setback.

Stressing people’s rejection of any attempt to fabricate victory through behind-the-scenes schemes, Umar Ayub Khan and Barrister Ali Zafar urged PTI workers to remain steadfast and focused solely on securing verified election results.

They advised candidates and workers not to vacate polling stations without obtaining duly signed and stamped Form 45 or leave returning officers' offices without acquiring certified Form 47.

Umar Ayub Khan and Barrister Ali Zafar urged the Election Commission of Pakistan to promptly release the results, rather than allowing any “irregularities to influence the electoral outcome”.

Expressing confidence in the “overwhelming support” of the people and anticipating significant success, they reiterated their commitment to establishing a democratically elected government, leading to the release of Imran Khan from detention and his ascension to the prime ministership

9,Nawaz stresses ‘full mandate’ to resolve issues,Says majority gained by a party would eliminate reliance on others,"As the nation headed to polls on Thursday, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif stressed the need for a party to obtain “full mandate” in the general elections in order to resolve the issues of the people.
The three-time premier was talking to media after casting his ballot in the provincial capital.
“Pakistan’s problems can only be solved when one party gains majority. One party should get ‘full mandate’ so that there is no reliance on others,” he said.
Expanding on his narrative, the PML-N Quaid underscored that this way the culture of using abusive language, which had been prevalent, would come to an end, people’s lives will become easier, inflation will be controlled and the nation will be able to lead a prosperous life.
He said this was the nation’s dream which had been shattered, and led to corruption in society. “We will make the dream a reality. We aim to bring the rights of people to their doorsteps.”
No prime minister in the country’s 76 years history has completed his constitutionally mandated five-year term.

Pakistan is currently grappling with myriad problems, with its fragile economy being the foremost concern. Political instability, terrorism, rising unemployment, increasing inflation, power and gas outages and health issues are among array of challenges awaiting the next government.
The country’s debt has soared to Rs78,000 billion while it faces the daunting task of paying $70 billion in foreign debt over the next three years.
Meanwhile, none of the political parties contesting the elections had a clear roadmap.  The media had also been keen on debating the rhetoric and statements given by political leaders.
The election day – Feb 8 – saw a suspension of mobile and internet services across the country.
Amnesty International slammed the move, terming it “reckless attack on people’s rights”.
“The decision to suspend telecommunications and mobile internet services on an election day is a blunt attack on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” Livia Saccardi, Interim Deputy Director for South Asia at Amnesty International, said in a post on the micro-blogging site “X”, formerly called Twitter.
