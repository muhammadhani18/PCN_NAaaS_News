1,Independent springs surprise against PPP,"Kot Ghulam Muhammad, historically considered stronghold of PPP, witnessed Kachelo’s unexpected victory","An independent candidate, Sardar Faisal Kachelo, contesting the general elections from Kot Ghulam Muhammad has emerged victorious over the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate, Sardar Noor Ahmed Bhargari, defying traditional political dynamics in the region.

However, with this second defeat in the general elections, a sense of disappointment has permeated among PPP supporters in Kot Ghulam Muhammad.
Conversely, supporters of independent candidate Faisal Kachelo erupted in jubilation, celebrating what they perceive as a significant victory. 
They gathered outside polling stations and danced to the beat of drums to celebrate. 
According to sources, the latest updates indicate that Kachelo maintains a clear advantage over PPP candidate Bhargari at other polling stations in the city.

2,Below average turnout in Sindh,"Sporadic clashes, polling suspensions, and delayed starts were observed at various places","The election day in Sindh was marred by widespread disruptions in mobile phone communication, leading to a reportedly below-average turnout.

Leaders of major political parties, along with independent observers, argued that the mobile network suspension adversely affected voters turnout. 
Instead of receiving information about their polling stations via SMS by texting their national identity card numbers to the Election Commission of Pakistan's number 8300, voters had to physically visit their polling stations.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, after casting his vote in Naudero, Larkana, urged the urgent restoration of mobile services. He emphasised the impact of the suspension on voters turnout and coordination among polling staff, particularly in relaying information about any violent incidents to law enforcement agencies and political parties.

Confrontations among workers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PPP, MQM-P, and Jamaat-e-Islami were observed in various areas.
Complaints of a delayed start of voting emerged from several polling stations, including station number 95 in NA-220 and PS-64 Hyderabad, where the process started in the afternoon.

4,Complaints of inaccuracies abound in voter lists,"ECP officials have categorically declared allegations as false, stating that the voter lists were compiled accurately","Voters and officials from various political parties have raised concerns over the accuracy of the voter lists compiled by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for the general elections 2024. They claim that serious errors in the lists have impeded voters from exercising their right to vote, resulting in the disenfranchisement of many.
Waqas, a resident of Liaquatabad, stated that his and his family's voting location was initially designated as GGSS School FC Area but was abruptly changed to GBSS. This sudden alteration left him disenfranchised, depriving him of his voting rights. Another voter, Kashif Khan, alleged widespread inaccuracies in the voter lists, citing instances where votes were made to cast votes at polling stations which were several kilometres away, instead of the ones near their homes.
Saad Hussain, a resident of Malir, lamented that his entire family's votes, initially consolidated in one polling station, were now spread across separate polling stations according to the current lists.

Polling agent of a political party Muhammad Ramiz claimed, ""There are numerous mistakes in the lists. Serial and family numbers are segregated on multiple pages. We provide people with details based on the electoral rolls, but upon entering polling stations, they are informed that their vote is not registered at that booth. This issue appears to be widespread across Karachi.""
Romaisa Shah, a female political agent, highlighted the adverse impact of errors in the voter lists on women voters, stating that many found themselves having to travel long distances to cast their votes. Muhammad Akbar, another political agent, alleged that such discrepancies were observed in numerous polling stations, including those in Districts Central, East, and Malir.

Contrary to these allegations, ECP officials have categorically declared them as false, stating that the voter lists were compiled accurately.

5,"Youth, women turn out in numbers","For first-timers, it was like a dream come true to cast vote","Thousands of young men and women exercised their right to vote for the first time in their lives during the general elections in Karachi, indicating the turnout to be huge. The polling stations across all districts witnessed enthusiastic participation from young people aged 18 and above. Some were accompanied by their parents.
Intermediate student Samina Ahmed, who voted at the Siraj-ud-Daula College polling station, could not hide her excitement. ""Casting my vote was a lifelong dream come true,"" she said and prayed for the prosperity of the country, regardless of who comes to power.
Sisters Humera and Sumera, casting their votes at the Dukhtaran-e-Awam School in DHA, highlighted the importance of using their right to choose wise leadership for the nation. Salman Ahmed, another young voter, stated that voting is a national duty, emphasising the need for youth to prioritise education.

A significant number of men and youth were observed casting their votes in the afternoon, taking advantage of the public holiday. Despite the late start, they actively participated in the democratic process, expressing their commitment to national duty.
Supporters of some candidates provided transportation facilities to ferry voters to and from polling stations. Women voters, in particular, utilised this service, often using six or nine-seater rickshaws adorned with party flags. Political parties clarified that this transportation initiative was voluntary and not an official party service.
During the general elections, political parties and independent candidates set up polling camps to guide voters to polling stations, following the Election Commission's code of conduct. Volunteers, both male and female, were present at these camps to assist voters. However, these volunteers lacked sufficient training, resulting in ineffective guidance to polling stations and booths. In the past, parties would send polling cards to voters' homes, facilitating knowledge of voting locations. This time, parties didn't conduct this practice, leading to delays in checking votes and informing volunteers at the camps. Consequently, voters encountered difficulties, with many unable to cast their votes.
