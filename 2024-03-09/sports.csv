He said the thefts had been reported from Bilal Road and Jail Road, adding that the installation of CCTV cameras after the establishment of the Punjab Safe City Complex would help nab the the thieves.

The CM, while addressing the parliamentary party meeting on Friday, stated that it is time to resolve the prevailing crisis and move towards reconciliation and that bickering and fights must stop. ‘Those who are deprived of bread and butter are awaiting our attention,’ she said. The CM further said that Assembly Members are responsible for protecting the rights of 25 crore people. 
Discussing the Ramazan Nigheban Package, the CM said that is everyone’s programme and not affiliated with any political party. 
If someone is poor then fulfilling their needs is our responsibility, she added. For the first time in 75 years, citizens are receiving relief at their doorsteps. Around 300,000 ration bags have already been distributed under the programme.
