0,Women stage rallies across Sindh,"Hyderabad echoes with slogans against honour killing, anti-women traditions","Challenging the prevalent standards of behaviour in the society pertaining to gender and demanding enforcement of the laws protecting women and providing them equal opportunities, the feminists marked the international women's day in Sindh on Friday. 
Rallies were taken out under the aegis of 'Aurat March' in several districts. The political parties, non-profit organizations as well as universities, colleges and schools also organised events in connection with the day around the province.
Hundreds of women participated in the march in Hyderabad, which walked for around three kilometers from Shahbaz Building to the press club outside which a stage was set up for speeches and tableaus. ""Jaiseen aurat kari rehandi, jang assanji jari hindi [until women are killed for honour, we will continue to wage war],"" the participants shouted.
""Aurat dushman har dastoor, na manzoor na manzoor [all laws victimizing women, unacceptable unacceptable]."" The playwright Noorual Huda Shah, while addressing the participants, emphasised on the need of rearing sons in a way that they learn to give due respect to women. ""Only then we will be able to live in a civilised society."" She said women are often denied their right to inheritance. Shah asked the women to know their rights and demand the same. 
Prof Arfana Mallah, one of the event's organisers, referred to the killing of a female lawyer in Hyderabad on March 7 only because she had turned down a wedding proposal.

She contended that no society can progress until accorded due respect and rights to women. She asked both the government and the society to play their respective rights to ensure that women are given the rights and honour which they deserved as humans.
Prof Amar Sindhu, another organiser of the event, lamented that women are denied their rights owing to the archaic traditions, customs and belief systems which are still prevalent in the sub-continent. ""No more imposed marriages,"" read a placard. ""Stop premature marriages,"" read another in the march. 
At a seminar organised by Sindh Agriculture and Forestry Workers Organization (SAFWCO) at a hotel in Hyderabad, notable lawyer and former President of Sindh High Court Bar Association Yousuf Laghari dwelt at length on the laws for gender parity. He pointed out that lax enforcement of the laws act as the stumbling blocks on the path of gender parity. 
The Hyderabad Women Prison arranged a program in which SHCBA's incumbent president advocate Ayaz Tunio sensitised the participants about their rights.
Implementation of anti-harassment laws 
The speakers at 'Aurat conference', organised by Sindhiani Tehreek of Awami Tehreek at the Arts Council in Sukkur district, called for action against what they described as 'tribal terror' which, they contended, is also perpetrating discrimination against women. Tehreek's leader Mahnoor Baloch called for legislating more stringent laws against harassment and for ensuring complete implementation on those laws as well.
The conference passed resolutions which demanded putting an end to the oppressive tribal and feudal systems in rural Sindh, declaring that the systems were anti-human and amounted to enmity with the country and with Sindh. The resolutions also called for legal action against the government officials who are discreetly supporting these systems.
They asked the government to shift the authority of investigating murder and suicide cases of women from the police to the district and session judges. They said the government should also establish driving schools at the taluka level in all districts of the province specifically for women. Providing free agricultural lands to women and facilities to the lady health workers are among other demands.
