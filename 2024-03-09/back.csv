0,"PML-N, PPP to scrap caretaker system",Both parties also decide to reform electoral process,"The ruling PML-N and its coalition partner PPP have reached a consensus to abolish the caretaker setup system and reform the electoral process.
Both parties have agreed that the head of the outgoing government will remain in office until the new general elections, eliminating the need for a caretaker government.
Additionally, after completing its term, the prime minister's cabinet will be dissolved, while the premier will continue to serve. Furthermore, the two parties have endorsed the drafting of legislation for electoral reforms.
Recommendations will be made to make the electoral process simple and easy. Both the PML-N and PPP will take other parties into confidence on the proposed reforms.
Besides, the PML-N-led alliance is also aiming to go for at least three major constitutional amendments, including abolishing the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), restoring Articles 62 and 63 to their original position, and empowering local governments.
A PML-N leader said initially the party was eying only two amendments: abolishing NAB and changing the wording of Articles 62 and 63 back to the original.
He added that both of them were also included in the party’s manifesto as well. He maintained that the third one had recently been included after the PML-N and MQM-P inked a formal agreement to empower local governments.
The PML-N leader continued that this was the reason the MQM-P had decided to sit on treasury benches.
The MQM-P-proposed amendment wants the federation to establish local governments under Article 140-A.
In addition, it wants to introduce Articles 140-B (which deals with the powers and functions of the local governments) and Article 140-C (which relates to the finances of the local governments). Background discussion with PML-N leaders revealed that the addition of reserved seats had emboldened the ruling alliance to take practical steps as a two-thirds majority was required for the constitutional amendments.
They said currently 225 (67%) out of the 336-member National Assembly was needed for making a constitutional amendment, saying PM Shehbaz Sharif’s election had already ensured that the coalition was supported by 201 MNAs.
They added that addition of the reserved seats would fill the required gap.
In January, three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif while launching the PML-N’s manifesto had declared in unequivocal terms that if his party secured victory in the February 8 general elections, NAB would be abolished.
Back in 2018, while grappling with three corruption references, Nawaz had expressed regret that he could not eliminate what he termed “draconian NAB laws” during his tenure.
“Abolish NAB,” the PML-N’s 51-page manifesto stated. “[It will] strengthen existing anti-corruption institutions and agencies.”
In addition to the NAB abolition pledge, Nawaz, who faced disqualification under Articles 62 and 63 and rallied behind the slogan of 'Vote Ko Izzat Do' (Respect the Vote), vowed in the manifesto to establish the unequivocal supremacy of parliament.
To do that, the party leader said, Articles 62 and 63 would be amended or restored to their original position of 1973, while Article 63-A would also be clarified.
Under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of Pakistan, a person cannot be qualified as a member of the national or provincial legislatures if he is not ‘Sadiq and Ameen’ – truthful and trustworthy.
On March 2, 1985, General Ziaul Haq had issued the Revival of Constitution of 1973 Order (RCO), changing 67 clauses and sections of 280 articles of the Constitution.
Some of the reworked language was clauses in Article 62, which now required members of parliament to meet the conditions of being Sadiq and Ameen – two Arabic terms which were never clearly defined in English, the language of the Constitution.

2,Vawda predicts Zardari controlling political strings,"""putting his own stamp on the power"", Vawda claims","Former federal minister Faisal Vawda on Friday predicted that PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari was poised to secure the presidency with a huge majority, saying that the former president's final act would involve ""putting his own stamp on the power"".
In discussions with various private channels, he recalled that he had previously foreseen MQM throwing its weight behind Zardari.He claimed that Zardari would initially extend a friendly pat to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif but would eventually engage in political manoeuvring, with the ex-president giving a forceful push and then sealing his dominance over the powers.Warning against underestimating the political prowess of PPP, Vawda asserted that attempts to ‘minus’ PPP from politics would prove futile.
Moreover, the former PTI leader claimed that the PPP harboured intentions to actively participate in Punjab during the budget proceedings, securing a significant role in negotiations with the IMF while gaining more control over political strings.Highlighting the impact of the recent change in government, Vawda criticised the surge in prices.
He claimed that prices of goods were previously under control, but with the coming of the ""contractors and watchmen of democracy” to power, petrol costs saw a spike of 11 rupees.He painted a bleak picture of the country’s economy in the coming days.

3,Marwat accuses Maryam of plotting to kill him,PTI leader claims Punjab CM's involvement came to light through intercepted telephone conversations,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Sher Afzal Marwat has made startling claims, accusing Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz of orchestrating an assassination plot against him. The serious allegations were brought to light on Saturday, as Marwat spoke to journalists outside Parliament House, asserting that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader had hired 'contract killers' to target him.
According to Marwat, the alleged contract to assassinate him was not just a verbal threat but involved tangible financial transactions.
He claimed that CM Maryam had authorised a payment for the sinister plan, and the transaction had taken place in Dubai. The PTI leader suggested that the chief minister's involvement came to light through intercepted telephone conversations, which he intended to share with relevant investigation authorities.

Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has summoned former PTI lawmaker Shandana Gulzar, who has also leveled allegations against Maryam Nawaz.
The PML-N had filed a complaint against Gulzar with the FIA, prompting the agency to initiate an inquiry into the serious accusations.
In response to the escalating situation, Punjab's Information Minister Uzma Bukhari demanded that Gulzar provide concrete evidence to substantiate her allegations. Bukhari emphasised that the government would not allow her to evade accountability.

Qaiser, a former National Assembly speaker, conveyed his frustration on a private news channel, emphasising the party's intention to resort to public protests if institutions continue to disregard their grievances.""Once we know that the country's institutions have no regard for our complaints, we will come out on the roads to fight for our rights,"" stated Qaiser, highlighting alleged rigging during the February 8 elections.
He expressed disappointment, asserting that all institutions seemed compromised, leaving the PTI with no choice but to consider street protests as a means to secure their legal and constitutional rights.

5,Don’t use honorifics with Naqvi’s name: SJC,Council says he damaged judiciary’s reputation,"The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has held that the honorifics “Justice” or “judge” should not be used with Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi's name as he had damaged the reputation of the judiciary.
""We conclude that Justice Naqvi is guilty of misconduct and should have been removed from the office of a judge. The number of instances of misconduct committed by Justice Naqvi has damaged the reputation of the judiciary. When the SJC commenced [the] hearing of the complaints, and throughout, we referred to Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi as Justice Naqvi, however, as he should have been removed for having committed serious [acts of] misconduct, the honorific ‘Justice’ or ‘Judge’ should not henceforth be used with Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi's name,"" read a 33-page opinion authored by the SJC chairman, Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa.
Out of 10, five charges of misconduct have been proven to be accurate before the council.
“Justice Naqvi cannot be said to be untouched by greed, and so [he] violated Article-II of the Code of Conduct. It also cannot be stated that he was above reproach, and so … violated Article-III of the Code of Conduct,” the opinion continued.
The SJC stated that Naqvi's conduct was also not free from impropriety expected of a judge in their official and private affairs.
[This was to] such an extent [that] he also violated Article-III of the Code of Conduct.”
The council pointed out that it was clear that Naqvi's actions were swayed by “consideration of personal advantage” and so he had violated Article-IV of the Code of Conduct.
The SJC held that Naqvi violated Article-VI of the Code of Conduct as he was involved to his personal advantage in a suit filed by Chaudhry Muhammad Shahbaz and knowingly deprived minors of their valuable property.
“By receiving substantial unexplained gifts, Justice Naqvi violated Article-VI of the Code of Conduct. The gifts included receiving Rs50 million; his sons receiving two commercial plots and two residential plots at a nominal price; and his daughter receiving £5,000.”
Therefore, the SJC concluded that that Naqvi was guilty of misconduct and should have been removed from the office of a judge.
Naqvi acquired a property at Saint John’s Park in Lahore Cantonment measuring 1,983.77 square yards from Chaudhry Muhammad Shahbaz and his son Muhammad Hassan Shahbaz on June 25, 2022 through a registered deed showing the sale consideration to be Rs106.84 million, but its market price was around Rs500 million.
The SJC observed that it had been established that Naqvi did not have sufficient income tax paid or declared money to justify the purchase of the property. It further noted that Naqvi had thrice revised his income tax or wealth statement to justify that he had the money to buy the property.
The owner of the property was Dr Bisma Warsi, who died in the year 2020 leaving behind her husband Chaudhry Muhammad Shahbaz and three minor sons namely Muhammad Hassan Shahbaz, Hussain Shahbaz Warsi and Ali Hamza Shahbaz Warsi.
Muhammad Hassan Shahbaz was born on June 3, 2004, Hussain Shahbaz Warsi on March 25, 2007, and Ali Hamza Shahbaz Warsi on August 19, 2008.
However, the property was sold by Chaudhry Muhammad Shahbaz and Muhammad Hassan Shahbaz by depriving two legal heirs of their share, namely Hussain Shahbaz Warsi and Ali Hamza Shahbaz Warsi.
Naqvi being a judge of the Lahore High Court had heard a writ petition in connection with the property and passed an order on December 17, 2012.
The SJC found that Naqvi misused his office and facilitated filing of a suit for declaration by and through Chaudhry Muhammad Shahbaz, wherein only one son of the late Dr Bisma Warsi was arrayed as the plaintiff namely Muhammad Hassan Shahbaz Warsi, who was a minor, and without disclosing the other two legal heirs.
The suit was filed against the public at large seeking a declaration that the plaintiffs were the only legal heirs of Dr Bisma Warsi.
The suit, filed on February 12, 2021, was decreed on March 31, 2021 with “extraordinary speed”.
On the basis of the decree passed in that suit, Naqvi exercised his influence with the Military Estate Office and Lahore Cantonment to have the property transferred into the names of the plaintiffs on June 24, 2022.
On the very next day on June 25, 2022, the property was purchased by Naqvi. A non-judicial stamp paper was used by Naqvi as a sale deed through which he bought the property on June 23, 2022, when it was not in the name of its sellers.
The facts taken together confirmed that extraordinary influence was exercised over the court and government officers by Naqvi by misusing his office and he had deprived two legal heirs of their fair share in the process.
""Justice Naqvi, in his reply to the show-cause notice, stated that 'As per the laws in Punjab, [the] suit for declaration of [the] legal heirs of [a] deceased owner is filed against the public at large’. In asserting this preposterously wrong concept to be the law of the Punjab (and to do so without citing the purported law) would be disingenuous of a law student but when a judge of the Supreme Court states this, the only conclusion which can be drawn is that Justice Naqvi was complicit in depriving the said minors of their property.""
The SJC noted that Naqvi had bought Plot No 144, Block E-1, situated in Gulberg-3, Lahore, measuring 2 kanals and 4 marlas, for a declared price of Rs60 million. However, as he did not have this amount of income tax paid or declared money, therefore, he showed that he had sold Plot No 375, Phase-2, DHA, Gujranwala Cantonment, for Rs60 million, even though he had purchased it for Rs4.7 million.
The SJC observed that a commercial plot, measuring 100 square yards, and a residential plot, measuring 500 square yards, were given to Naqvi's son, Syed Tasadduq Murtaza Naqvi, in Lahore Smart City and Capital Smart City, respectively as well as another commercial plot, measuring 100 square yards and a residential plot, measuring 500 square yards, were given to his other son, Syed Tasadduq Mustafa Naqvi, at heavily discounted prices by the owner of the projects, namely, Zahid Rafique. The SJC noted that the reason for this was that Naqvi had facilitated Zahid Rafique’s business affairs by misusing his office and granting undue favours to him.
The council further stated that three plots of one kanal each -- Plot No 222, Block-B, Park Road, Federal Government Employees Housing Foundation, Islamabad; Plot No 357, Street No. 9, Block-A, Park Road, Federal Government Employees Housing Foundation, Islamabad; and Plot No 249, Street No. 1, G-17/1, Supreme Court Employees Cooperative Housing Society, Islamabad -- were illegally purchased by Naqvi without having sufficient income tax paid or declared money.
The SJC observed that Muhammad Safdar Khan and Zahid Rafique had tried their best to help Naqvi in justifying the price of the 100 Saint John's Park property and the payment of Rs50 million made by Lahore Smart City (Pvt) Ltd to acquire it.
 “But they utterly failed to state, let alone justify, why a registered company would settle its liability of a substantial amount (fifty million rupees) which it allegedly owed to Muhammad Safdar Khan by not simply paying him the amount,” the SJC opinion stated.
“And, for a long standing businessman, which Zahid Rafique claimed he was, and for a well-established company, this is not only inexplicable but it is also contrary to rudimentary account keeping and would not be legally compliant,” it added.
“We, therefore, place no credence on the testimonies of Muhammad Safdar Khan and Zahid Rafique. On his part, Justice Naqvi offered no justifiable reason in his written reply for doing so and shied away from testifying. In his reply, Justice Naqvi did not disclose why a company had paid a substantial amount --fifty million rupees -- to buy 100 Saint John's Park. We are therefore left to conclude that Zahid Rafique through his company, Lahore Smart City (Pvt) Ltd, had paid a considerable portion of the sale consideration of 100 Saint John's Park.”
The council noted that a judge accepting such “largesse” from a property developer, who claimed that he hardly knew Naqvi, raised very serious questions of propriety.
“Since no viable explanation for paying the said fifty million rupees was forthcoming we are left to assume that such incomprehensible generosity to a judge was with the expectation that it would be handsomely recompensed.”
While concluding its opinion, the SJC also commended the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman, bar councils and Advocate Mian Dawood, the primary complainant against Naqvi, for their assistance in the matter for upholding the rule of law and the principles of accountability.

7,How SC’s night vigil saved democracy,CJ Qazi Faez Isa pays homage to Justice Sardar Tariq Masood at farewell reference,"Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa has narrated how the Supreme Court intervened at night to ensure timely elections after the Lahore High Court (LHC) issued an order, which, according to him, could derail the democratic process.
“A decision of the LHC could have derailed the election once again. We heard the case against this order during the night before going on leave,” Justice Isa said while addressing a farewell reference given in honor of SC judge Sardar Tarig Masood, who retired on Friday.
On December 14, the LHC suspended the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification appointing district returning officers (DROs), returning officers (ROs), and assistant returning officers (AROs) from the executive for performing duties at Feb 8 general elections.
However, a three-member bench—comprising Justice Isa, Justice Masood, and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah—suspended the LHC ruling on December 15. The same bench later set aside the LHC order, paving the way for preparations for the last general elections.
The CJ noted that they wanted to hear the case with a bench consisting of three senior judges.
“But Justice Ijazul Ahsan declined to sit on the bench. After that, we included another senior judge [Justice Shah] and heard the decision at midnight. If it hadn't happened, the elections could have been derailed on the date set by the President of Pakistan and the ECP,” he added.
Commending his integrity and straightforwardness, the CJ noted that the objections raised to Justice Sardar Tariq Masood’s inclusion in a bench hearing an intra-court appeal against an SC order banning trial of civilians in military courts were baseless.
“Justice Masood had not expressed any opinion in his note on the matter of military courts. However, he recused himself from hearing the appeal after petitioners’ objection,” he said.
The last PML-N led government had decided to hold the trial of the alleged PTI activists who vandalized state and army properties on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
A number of petitioners challenged the move in the SC and former CJ Umar Ata Bandial formed a larger bench including Justice Isa and Justice Masood to hear the petitions.
However, both the judges later refused to sit on the bench with Justice Masood also writing a note.
In the note, the judge had regretted that the petitions challenging the military court trials were filed by those who apparently were not detained, nor facing trial with regard to the offences, allegedly committed on May 9 in the cantonment areas.
Later, a five-member larger bench unanimously invalidated these trials on Oct 23, 2023. The bench directed the authorities to conduct the trials of such accused individuals in ordinary courts.
The government lodged an intra-court appeal against the verdict, and on Dec 13, 2023, a six-member SC bench—led by Justice Masood—admitted the appeal for hearing, suspending the Oct 23 verdict. The judge, however, recused himself from hearing the case after some petitioners raised objections to him.

9,"Sanjrani quits Senate, takes oath as MPA",Sanjrani’s efforts to cling on to the higher post raise many eyebrows across the political spectrum,"Sadiq Sanjrani took oath as a member of the Balochistan Assembly on Friday, after failing to muster support of the ruling coalition to continue as the Senate chairman for the remaining period of his term, which was set to expire later this month.
Sanjrani was elected to the provincial assembly from PB-32, Chagai, in the February 8 general elections. However, instead of taking the oath as an MPA, in the inaugural session of the provincial assembly, he continued in his role as the Senate chairman.
On Thursday, he convened and chaired a meeting, where the idea of passing a resolution to amend Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate was discussed. Sanjrani’s efforts to cling on to the higher post raise many eyebrows across the political spectrum.
After his election as an MPA, he was required to relinquish his Senate position under Article 223(4) of the Constitution. The article says that if a member of either House or of a Provincial Assembly becomes a candidate for a second seat which he may not hold concurrently with his first seat, then his first seat shall become vacant as soon as he is elected to the second seat.
The Rule 9(1) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate reads: “At the first meeting of the Senate, after the members have taken oath and to the exclusion of any other business including privilege and adjournment motions, the Senate shall proceed to elect from amongst its members a Chairman, and so often as the Office of the Chairman becomes vacant the Senate shall elect another member as its Chairman, in accordance with the rules.”
Furthermore, Rule 9(2) of the Senate rules reads, “The first meeting of the Senate for election of the Chairman shall be presided over by the outgoing Chairman or, in his absence, by a person nominated by the President.”
The Balochistan Assembly met with Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola in the chair. In addition to Sanjrani, Mir Zaffar Zehri and Muhammad Khan Lehri also took the oath as members of the provincial Assembly. The session will meet again on Saturday (today) for the election of the president.
