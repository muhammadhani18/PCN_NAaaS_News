4,Girls’ education still a challenge,Report sheds light on persistent gender disparities in education,"A higher percentage of girls (around 8%) are still out of school as compared to boys (6%), says the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which is a flagship project of the Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi (ITA), the largest citizen-led learning accountability initiative.
The report was officially unveiled coinciding with International Women’s Day with a galaxy of senior educationists, distinguished panellists, government officials, representatives from civil society, development partners, media persons, students and teachers in attendance.
Former federal education minister Rana Tanveer Hussain was the chief guest on the occasion. He welcomed the ASER report’s findings and held they would help the decision makers take up and address the concerns particularly, those of girls education, out-of-school children, learning gap etc as pointed out in the ASER National Report.
Province-wise results show that the gender gap in the percentage of out-of-school children (OOSC) aged 6-16 years is more pronounced in Balochistan, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Although the gender gap in the share of OOSC has narrowed over time, a significant percentage (14%) of both girls and boys (aged 6-16) in rural areas remain outside the education system.
The gender gaps in learning have narrowed from 2012, 2014 to 2023, including pandemic/flood years (2020-2023), literacy (at least sentences) and numeracy (subtraction). The launch event called for decisive measures to be taken in support of girls and other marginalised groups.
According to the report ASER Pakistan reached more than 272,000 children of 3-5 years across 151 rural and 123 urban district blocks in 31 divisions of Pakistan including, 8,765 public and private schools/madrassahs and NFE centres. More than 200,000 children 5-16 years were assessed on a foundational learning or grade 2 tool in Urdu, Arithmetic, and English. The twelfth launch of ASER Pakistan on foundational literacy and numeracy in Pakistan was made possible by 10,000+ educated enumerators in collaboration with 16 civil society organisations, including the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD).
Despite adverse shocks to the education system, such as COVID-19 and disastrous floods, the ASER rural results for 2023 indicate an improvement in enrolment of children aged 3-5 years (42% in 2023, and 6-16 years 88% in 2023 compared to 79% (rural) in 2014. The demand for education is growing as an essential. The report reveals an overall dip in learning trends from 2021 to 2023 for grade 5 students in Urdu (54.9% to 50%) and Arithmetic (51.4% to 46.3%).
However, there are positive trends in specific regions, such as an 8.5% improvement in Urdu (story level) in Gilgit Baltistan and a 5% improvement in arithmetic (2-digit division) in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). From 2014 to 2019 Pakistan’s learning levels had improved 15-17% in Urdu, Arithmetic and English; learning gains received a setback during COVID and floods.
During the ASER 2023 launch, brave calls to action were also made by female students from the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) schools and transgender individuals.

In response, prompt action has been taken on an emergency basis, with a widespread dengue prevention campaign initiated across the division. This campaign, slated to continue with vigour throughout the holy month of Ramazan, has also introduced a new dengue eradication plan.

According to sources, Rawalpindi Division Commissioner, Aamir Khattak, has reaffirmed the commitment to combat dengue through proactive measures, declaring a hands-on approach to tackle the situation before it escalates.
Meanwhile, medical experts have raised alarms about the increased risk of dengue spread during this dry season following the rains, terming it an ideal breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes. Consequently, special dengue wards are being established in hospitals for the upcoming holy month. Moreover, leaves of all dengue workers across the district have been cancelled and an additional 2,700 dengue patrol workers will be recruited.
Sources said upon the identification of four dengue cases in Rawalpindi, the commissioner promptly called for an emergency dengue prevention meeting. Attended by Deputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema, Additional Commissioner (Coordination), the Chief Executive Officer of Health, and heads of relevant government departments, the meeting addressed the gravity of the situation.
Health department officials briefed the attendees, highlighting that since January 1, Rawalpindi district has recorded four confirmed cases of dengue, a matter of extreme concern.
The commissioner emphasised stringent action against those violating SOPs, cautioning that negligence by any individual poses a risk to all. Health representatives disclosed that from January 1 until now, 14 FIRs and 32 challans have been registered while seven buildings have been sealed and fines totalling Rs15,000 have been imposed across the district for dengue SOP violations.

6,‘Woman more impacted by climate-related disasters’,"Women disproportionately affected due to social, economic, and cultural factors, Dr. Ali Mir","There is a need for sustainable population growth to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change especially on vulnerable women.
This was the crux of the views expressed by policymakers, government officials, climate change experts, researchers and civil society organisations at a dissemination event of a groundbreaking research study titled “Climate Change and Population Linkage: Analyzing Adaptation and Resilience Strategies in Sindh, Balochistan, and South Punjab.”
The study was conducted by the Population Council with support from UNFPA in three provinces of the country affected by the unprecedented floods of 2022. Focusing on districts Khairpur Mir, Rajanpur, and Pishin which were severely affected during the floods, the study highlights and documents vulnerabilities of women caused and aggravated by climate change-induced disasters.
In his welcome remarks, Dr Ali Mir, Senior Director Programmes at, Population Council said, “The impact of climate change on women’s lives is particularly pronounced, with women disproportionately affected due to social, economic, and cultural factors”. He also mentioned that Pakistan, despite having one of the world’s lowest carbon footprints, remains among the top ten countries most vulnerable to extreme climate events. The recent floods of 2022, one of the most devastating natural catastrophes in recent times, displaced up to 33 million people, resulted in 1700 fatalities, and inflicted colossal damage to infrastructure. “Women are often the most vulnerable to climate change due to social, economic, and cultural factors, such as limited access to resources, information, and decision-making.”, he added.
