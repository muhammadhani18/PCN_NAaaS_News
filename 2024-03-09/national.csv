0,Food security under threat,"Soil and groundwater salinity hinders plant growth, reduce crop yields","Experts have warned that salinity in soil and groundwater is taking a heavy toll on agricultural production in the country, which is causing losses to farmers and putting food security at risk.
The warning comes at a time when the fast changing climate globally has wreaked havoc in the shape of floods, droughts and heat waves in Pakistan and elsewhere, damaging crops and destroying livelihoods of many people.
The experts said salinity in soil and groundwater could indeed have detrimental effects on farm production as it could hinder plant growth and reduce crop yields.
They said in Sindh, where agriculture was a significant part of the economy, addressing salinity issues was crucial for sustaining crop productivity and ensuring food security.
These experts were sharing their views at a one-day training programme for farmers organised at the Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) under the aegis of Australian Research Council.
The objective of the event was to provide technical training to saline-affected farmers in the Indus Basin region of Sindh under the “Adapting to Salinity in the Indus Basin Project.”
The experts emphasised that measures such as improved irrigation practices, drainage systems and soil management techniques could help mitigate the impact of salinity in the region.
They suggested that the promotion of salt-tolerant crop varieties and implementation of policies to conserve water resources could also be useful and beneficial for combating the salinity challenges.
SAU Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Jan Muhammad Marri stated that negative impacts on agricultural production were being observed in Sindh due to salinity in soil and groundwater.
He stressed the importance of farmers’ training to make such land cultivable and cope with salinity. In terms of salinity, he added, Sindh was the most affected province of Pakistan.
Marri said the Australian project “Adapting to Salinity in the Indus Basin” would not only make farmlands cultivable through research and recommendations from agricultural and water experts but also enable all stakeholders to play an important role in rehabilitating severely saline-impacted lands and making them productive.
SAU Dean Faculty of Crop Production Dr Inayatullah Rajper said the effects of salinity existed in soil and water in all four provinces, particularly because of the use of non-prescribed fertilisers, thus necessitating technical assistance for the affected farmers.
Later on, during the technical session and training, various eminent agricultural experts including Dr Muneer Ahmed Mangrio, Dr Muharram Ali, Dr Jawed Umrani, Bhawani Shankar and others imparted training to a large number of farmers, who hailed from various districts of Sindh including Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Jamshoro, Matiari, Sanghar, Badin and Tando Allahyar.

1,World food index falls for 7th month in a row,Lower cereal prices offset higher rates of sugar and meat,"The United Nations food agency’s world price index fell in February for a seventh consecutive month as lower prices for all major cereals more than offset the rising price of sugar and meat.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation’s price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 117.3 points in February, down from a revised 118.2 points the previous month, the agency said on Friday.
The February reading was the lowest since February 2021.
The cereal index fell 5% month-on-month in February to stand 22.3% below its level a year ago thanks to expectations of large maize harvests in South America and competitive prices offered by Ukraine.
Vegetable oil prices fell 1.3% in February from January to stand 11% below year ago levels amid prospects for abundant South America supplies. Rapeseed and sunflower oil prices also fell, thanks to ample exports.
The UN agency’s sugar index, by contrast, rose 3.2% month-on-month in February, reflecting persistent concerns over top producer Brazil’s upcoming output and forecast production declines in Thailand and India.
In a separate report on cereal supply and demand, the agency raised its estimate for 2023 cereal output by 1.1% from the previous year to 2,840 million metric tons thanks to increased maize supplies in Brazil, China and the United States.
Looking ahead to 2024, the UN agency pegged wheat output up 1% from a year earlier at 797 million tons because of favourable weather in North America and top exporter Russia, as well as in China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey.

2,Plan finalised to provide online services for land records,It will facilitate overseas Pakistanis in property transfer through use of technology,"The Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (OP&HRD) has finalised a plan to provide online services for land records to overseas Pakistanis following directives from the prime minister.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken serious notice of issues pertaining to property transfer and the release of related certificates.
Currently, the overseas Pakistanis either have to grant the Power of Attorney to their relatives or physically visit Pakistan to manage property transfers and obtain other land documents.
According to sources, the Ministry of OP&HRD has largely addressed the issues with plans to use technology for online land transfers and the issuance of documents through Pakistani embassies abroad.
A follow-up meeting is scheduled for next Wednesday with the Punjab Land Department to finalise details such as cost sharing and the equipment required for the entire process.
This initiative will serve as a model project in Punjab and will be subsequently replicated in other provinces.
In adherence to PM Shehbaz’s directives, OP&HRD Secretary Dr Arshad Mahmood chaired a meeting with all relevant stakeholders.
During the meeting, the secretary expressed grave concern over the challenges faced by overseas Pakistanis in safeguarding and maintaining the possession of lands, which often remained disputed for years.
In response, the director-general of the Punjab Land Records Authority (PLRA) highlighted that the proposal for collaboration to provide land record services to overseas Pakistanis was a groundbreaking step in the era of information technology, aimed at facilitating the land-related transactions.
This initiative will offer three major services – Fard, e-registration, and mutation. Furthermore, the online facility will eliminate middlemen in transactions such as sales and purchases, reducing the risks of fraud and litigation.
PLRA will send a fresh request to the Ministry of OP&HRD through outlining the anticipated benefits of the initiative, which will precede the service-level agreement between the two entities.
Addressing concerns, the PLRA DG noted that e-registration services were already available across Punjab. All services will be accessible to the overseas Pakistanis abroad, eliminating the need for travel to Pakistan for property registration and mutation.
The OP&HRD secretary informed the PLRA that the ministry had consulted various stakeholders, including the ministries of finance, foreign affairs, law and justice, and inter-provincial coordination.
The secretary reiterated his concern over the mutation issues. After detailed deliberations, several decisions were taken to facilitate the overseas Pakistanis by providing online services for land records and the transfer of property.

3,Rupee rises to 4-1/2-month high vs dollar,Currency finds support from IMF’s positive response to loan talks,"Pakistani currency on Friday hit a four-and-a-half-month high at Rs279.04 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market where it extended its uptrend for the second consecutive day.
The latest, meaningful increase in the rupee value came in the wake of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) positive response to Pakistan over the request of initiating formal talks for a new loan programme ahead of the completion of the process of forming a new government.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency increased 0.08%, or Rs0.25, against the greenback on a day-on-day basis, wiping out the nominal losses suffered in the prior one week.
With the appreciation, the currency has cumulatively surged 10.05%, or Rs28.06, over the past six months since plunging to the all-time low close at Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
In the open market too, the rupee extended gains for the second successive day by Rs0.04, closing at Rs281.70/$, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
The smart recovery of the rupee has narrowed disparity between the two currency markets in the past two days to Rs2.67 (0.95%) compared to the difference of over 1% last week. The gap stood low compared to the ceiling of 1.25% (around Rs4 at current levels) recommended by the IMF.
The maintenance of the difference within the IMF-recommended limit signals that currency markets are being run by market forces (dealers and traders) instead of the government, meeting a key condition of the IMF loan programme.

4,"Textile body, UK chamber to deepen cooperation",Will strive to tap networking opportunities for industry leaders,"A comprehensive agreement has been reached between the Greater Birmingham Chamber of Commerce (GBCC) and the Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA), aimed at fostering mutual cooperation and enhancing bilateral trade between Pakistan and the United Kingdom.
This landmark agreement underscores the commitment to strengthening commercial and industrial ties between the private sectors of both nations.
In this regard, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the two bodies. The agreement, which can potentially enhance textile garment exports, was aimed at engaging in conversations and tapping networking opportunities between industry leaders from Pakistan and the UK.
According to the MoU, the GBCC and PRGMEA agreed to build a dependable, pragmatic and advantageous relationship, besides initiating effective and cordial relations between the two associations through increased cooperation among industrialists, businessmen, and entrepreneurs.

PRGMEA Central Chairman Mubashar Naseer Butt said that both the organisations agreed to enhance growth and interaction and the memorandum should be favourable for both.
He added that both sides agreed that there should be maximum dissemination of information, which could lead to further promotion of trade and industry and benefit the exporters, industrialists, and entrepreneurs.
Naseer said that both the organisations agreed that the initiative was intended to be a trailblazer and acknowledged the importance of mutual cooperation.
On the occasion, GBCC President Dr Nasir Awan maintained that the Greater Birmingham Chamber worked to connect, support and grow local businesses situated in Birmingham while PRGMEA, which represented the manufacturers and exporters in Pakistan’s readymade garments industry, desired to become a partner and extend all support, cooperation, and assistance.
Both organisations agreed on the importance of developing concrete proposals and recommendations to advance trading and industrial activities in their respective countries. They committed to safeguarding investments and promoting bilateral activities among their members.

5,Wheat harvest target may be missed,Country likely to produce 29m tons against target of 32m tons due to high input costs,"Pakistan is likely to miss this year’s wheat production target owing to high energy costs and manipulation in urea prices.
Farmers have been forced to buy urea at double the actual price as they paid over Rs5,000 per bag due to alleged monopoly of the fertiliser industry.
As the industry could not take action against price manipulation, the caretaker government referred a case against fertiliser manufacturers to the Competition Commission of Pakistan.
As prices of inputs stay at higher levels, the country is likely to produce 29 million tons of wheat in the current season, three million tons lower than the target of 32 million tons.
Officials of the food security ministry cautioned that wheat crop harvest could face further damage from expected heat waves in the coming weeks.
Wheat harvesting will commence on March 15 in most areas of Sindh. Punjab is likely to produce 22 million tons of wheat, Sindh is expected to reap a harvest of 4 million tons, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 1.4 million tons and Balochistan 1.3 million tons.
Sources in the Ministry of National Food Security and Research stated that mismanagement in urea transportation and seasonal effects had sparked concerns that wheat output target may be missed in the current year.
In addition, provinces are not willing to set uniform prices of wheat that will pose challenges to the state agency in its commodity procurement drive.
The federal government has written letters to Sindh and Balochistan, asking them to fix uniform prices but their response is awaited.
Read: Wheat farmers advised against using urea
The federal government said that Sindh administration had revised the support price of wheat to Rs4,000 per 40 kg. It may be noted that in consultation with provinces, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had approved on December 20, 2023 a “profitable” support price of Rs3,900 per 40 kg for the wheat crop of 2023-24.
At the time of fixing the support price, the food security ministry said that it was assumed that the uniform price would not only boost the production of wheat crop but also stabilise prices in the country.
Though the wheat procurement drive is about to begin, keeping in view the crop production, hoarding, smuggling, weather vagaries and price difference amongst provinces, the procurement campaign may not run smoothly.
Furthermore, Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Supplies Corporation (Passco) will not be able to procure wheat from Sindh at a price higher than Rs3,900.
Consequently, common farmers of the province would suffer and would not be able to fetch fair returns, the food security ministry said, adding that Sindh government had been requested to revisit its unilateral decision of fixing the support price at Rs4,000.
The government of Balochistan has revised the price of wheat even higher at Rs4,300 per 40 kg compared to the rate of Rs3,900 notified in line with the decision of ECC.
In this case too, the food security ministry said that Passco would not be able to buy wheat from Balochistan at a price above Rs3,900 per 40 kg. Resultantly, like Sindh, the common growers of Balochistan will also suffer and will not be able to receive a fair return for their produce.
The ministry added that the provincial administration of Balochistan has been asked to revisit its decision of setting the support price at Rs4,300 while keeping in view the agreed price of Rs3,900.

6,Food prices drive inflation higher,SPI rises 1.11% week-on-week following surge in cost of eatables,"Pakistan’s weekly inflation reading remained high at 1.11% in the week ended March 7, fuelled by a notable surge in food prices ahead of the beginning of Ramazan and maintaining the uptrend for the second successive week.
According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics’ (PBS) data, the weekly Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) rose 32.39% on a year-on-year basis compared to the corresponding week of last year.
The inflation indicator went up 1.11% week-on-week, driven by the onion price that spiked 33.86% nationwide to Rs238.30 per kg compared to Rs178.02 in the previous week.
Potato too became highly costlier by 23.81% to Rs69.47 per kg compared to the price of Rs56.11 in the prior week.
Tomato price rose 16.42% to Rs136.59 per kg while banana cost stood 7.12% higher at Rs153.76 per dozen in the week under review compared to Rs143.54 in the previous week, according to the PBS.
Prices of other commodities increased up to 4.43% including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), eggs, petrol, firewood, beef, mutton, cooked daal and clothes.
Out of the 51 essential commodities covered by the SPI basket, prices of 14 (27.45%) items rose, another 14 (27.45%) items decreased and 23 (45.10%) items remained unchanged compared to the previous week.
On a year-on-year basis, SPI rose 32.39% mainly due to a 570% spike in gas charges for the first quarter. It was followed by tomato becoming expensive by 176.55%. Other commodities became costlier up to 82% on a year-on-year basis including chilli (powder), gents sponge chappal, wheat flour, gents sandal, onion, garlic, gur, sugar and potato.
Inflation may remain on an uptrend in the short run (on a week-on-week basis) ahead of the fasting month of Ramazan, which will begin on March 12 or 13 depending on the sighting of the moon. Also, prices of food items including fruits go up significantly in the first two weeks of the holy month.
Earlier, the benchmark monthly inflation, measured by the Consumer Price index (CPI), decelerated to 23.1% in February compared to 28.3% in the prior month. Forecasts indicate that it will further slow down to 20-21% in March due to a high base effect.
Pakistan’s central bank in late January, however, revised up its inflation forecast to 23-25% for FY24 compared to its previous estimate of 20-22% made in July 2023.

7,Remittances up ahead of Ramazan,Overseas Pakistanis send 18% higher remittances that reach $2.25b,"The inflow of workers’ remittances rose 18% in February 2024 compared to the same month of last year, reaching $2.25 billion ahead of the fasting month of Ramazan that is beginning next week.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the remittances had stood at $1.90 billion in February last year.
The higher inflows should help finance the trade deficit and keep the current account balance at breakeven level. They may also support the Pakistani rupee in standing at stronger levels compared to the US dollar and currencies of other trading partners.
Non-resident Pakistanis send more funds to their family members and friends back home ahead of and during Ramazan and Eid festival to help them cope with high inflation and meet relatively higher expenditures.
On a month-on-month basis, however, the remittances fell 6% to $2.25 billion in February compared to $2.39 billion in the prior month.
Topline Securities Deputy Head of Equity Sales Ali Najib linked the drop in remittances with lesser working days in February compared to January as a notable number of non-resident Pakistanis sent money on a weekly or fortnightly basis.
Optimus Securities Head of Research Maaz Azam supported Najib’s views, saying the inflows would have been stable on a month-on-month basis had the number of days in the two months been equal.
Overseas Pakistanis sent on an average $77.57 each day in February compared to $77.35 a day in January, which showed comparatively better inflows in February.
In the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of the current fiscal year, the expatriate Pakistanis remitted $18.08 billion, showing a nominal 1.25% drop compared to $18.31 billion in the same period of last fiscal year, according to the central bank data.
SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad anticipated in late January 2024 that workers’ remittances would increase to $28 billion in the current fiscal year compared to $27 billion in FY23.
He projected that inflows would remain higher in the second half of the fiscal year as against the first one, believing the stability of the rupee-dollar parity and the beginning of Ramazan and two Eid festivals would encourage expatriates to send higher amounts to their family members in Pakistan.
Read: SBP brings incentives to attract remittances
Azam said the remittances increased 18% in February compared to the same month of last year because the Pakistani rupee remained stable in the month compared to high currency volatility in February 2023.
He recalled that former finance minister Ishaq Dar had controlled the rupee-dollar parity and kept the rupee stronger artificially in the inter-bank market in February 2023. The tactic led to the establishment of illegal currency markets in border areas, particularly with Afghanistan, and encouraged the illicit Hawala-Hundi system operators to smuggle foreign currencies to neighbouring countries.
The illegal traders offered significantly higher dollar conversion rates for remittances. Consequently, a significant number of overseas Pakistanis sent remittances through unofficial channels, resulting in lower inflows through official channels in February 2023.
Later, the caretaker government launched a crackdown on currency smugglers and hoarders. The clean-up operation helped crush the illegal markets in border areas. This forced the non-resident Pakistanis to send remittances through official channels, which led to a boost in receipts in February this year.
Country-wise remittances
Workers’ remittances from Saudi Arabia increased 18% to $540 million in February 2024 compared to $455 million in the same month of last year.
Overseas Pakistanis sent 19% higher remittances from the UAE at $385 million compared to $324 million in the corresponding month of last year.
The expatriates dispatched 9% higher funds from the UK at $346 million compared to $317 million in February last year. They remitted 7% higher funds from EU counties that reached $263 million compared to $245 million in the previous year.
From the US, they dispatched $287 million, exhibiting a growth of 31% compared to $220 million last year.
The non-resident Pakistanis sent 102% higher remittances from other countries that touched $196 million compared to $97 million in the same month of last year.

8,Stocks gain modestly on IMF deal optimism,"KSE-100 index adds 190.67 points, settles at 65,793.76","Pakistan Stock Exchange on Friday modestly rose by nearly 200 points as investors cheered the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) willingness to negotiate a new loan programme to help Pakistan address its economic woes.
Investor sentiment got a boost from the new government’s promises to steer the country out of economic instability.
In the morning, trading kicked off on a healthy note and the benchmark KSE-100 index remained at higher levels until midday despite some wide fluctuations. It reached the intra-day high of 66,067.53 points in the second half.
A rally in dollar bonds and shrinking of trade deficit by 30.2% year-on-year (YoY) in Jul-Feb FY24 triggered the positive momentum in the market.
Meanwhile, the State Bank reported that workers’ remittances reached $2.25 billion in February, showing a decrease of 6.2% month-on-month and increase of 13% YoY.
“Stocks showed recovery after the IMF affirmed that its mission would hold a second review under the standby arrangement shortly to ensure macroeconomic stability,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Dollar bonds’ rally to March 2022 peak, upbeat data of trade deficit that shrank 30.2% YoY for Jul-Feb FY24 and strong rupee recovery played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX,” he added.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded modest gains of 190.67 points, or 0.29%, and settled at 65,793.76.
Topline Securities, in its report, said that the KSE-100 index largely traded in the positive zone and closed at 65,794, up 0.3%.
“This positivity in the market can be attributed to the IMF’s statement that they are ready to send a mission to Pakistan after formation of the cabinet,” it said.
Major positive input came from Dawood Hercules Corporation, Engro Fertilisers, Pakistan Services, Shell Pakistan and National Refinery, which contributed 175 points to the index.
