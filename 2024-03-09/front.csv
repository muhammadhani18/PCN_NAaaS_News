0,"Israeli settlements expand by record amount, UN rights chief says",Massive expansion raises grave concerns about future of Palestinian state,"Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories have expanded by a record amount and risk eliminating any practical possibly of a Palestinian state, the U.N. human rights chief said on Friday.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said that the growth of Israeli settlements amounted to the transfer by Israel of its own population, which he reiterated was a war crime. The U.S. Biden administration said last month the settlements were ""inconsistent"" with international law after Israel announced new housing plans in the occupied West Bank.
""Settler violence and settlement-related violations have reached shocking new levels, and risk eliminating any practical possibility of establishing a viable Palestinian State,"" Turk said in a statement accompanying the report which will be presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in late March.
Israel's diplomatic mission in Geneva said that the report should have included the deaths of 36 Israelis in 2023. ""Human rights are universal, yet Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism are ignored by the Office (of the High Commissioner) time and time again,"" it said in a statement.
The 16-page report, based on the U.N.'s own monitoring as well as other sources, documented 24,300 new Israeli housing units in the occupied West Bank during a one-year period through to end-October 2023, which it said was the highest on record since monitoring began in 2017.
It also said there had been a dramatic increase in the intensity, severity and regularity of both Israeli settler and state violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, particularly since the deadly Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7
Since then, more than 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces or by settlers, it said.
Israel, which captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, claims a biblical birthright to the land where settlements are expanding. Its military says it is conducting counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank and is targeting suspected militants.
Turk's report noted that the policies of Israel's government, which is the most right-wing in the country's history and includes religious nationalists with close ties to settlers, appeared aligned to an ""unprecedented extent"" with the goals of the Israeli settler movement.
It has documented cases of settlers wearing full or partial Israeli army uniforms and carrying army rifles while harassing or attacking Palestinians, in a blurring of the lines between them. Sometimes they were shot at point-blank range, it said.
The five-month-old Gaza war has put a renewed focus on a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as foreseen by the Oslo accords from the early 1990s.
But there has been little progress on achieving Palestinian statehood since then, with the expansion of settlements being one of the obstacles.

1,Zardari makes history,Ruling coalition’s joint candidate bags 411 votes against SIC’s Achakzai 181 to become the country’s 14 president,"Asif Ali Zardari has proved his mettle and survival instincts in the past.
The PPP co-chairperson on Saturday again made a startling comeback by winning the presidential election with a major parliamentary vote and earning the title of the 14th head of the state. He has served as the president of the country earlier as well.
Zardari, who took over the reins of the PPP after his wife and former premier Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in December 2007, emerged victorious in the presidential election this time around after his party struck a coalition agreement with the PML-N.
In exchange, the PPP had backed PML-N’s Shehbaz Sharif in becoming the prime minister following the February 8 general elections.
The Shehbaz-Zardari duo is the new face of the apparently firm-footed coalition government.
Previously, Shehbaz led a coalition government for 16 months after the then opposition ousted PTI’s Imran Khan from the premiership in April 2022 through a no-confidence resolution.
Zardari had earlier completed his five-year term as the president of the country in 2013.
Both Shehbaz and Zardari have returned to their previous roles now and sit at the pinnacle of their political careers.
Earlier, Zardari was dubbed as an accidental beneficiary entering the presidency. However, this time around, he ensured that the timely wheeling and dealing between the two major political parties – his PPP and the PML-N -- paved the way for his return to the presidency.
In line with Zardari’s easy win in the vote involving legislators from parliament and four provincial assemblies, there are hopes that the duo’s rule will mark a new phase of stability in the country.

Both have earned the reputation of being pragmatic politicians and the ones who do not want confrontation with the ‘powerful circles’ -- at least not for now.
Additionally, they both are on the same page when it comes to dealing with economics issues. They have frequently emphasised on the need to sign a charter of economy in order to overcome the country’s financial woes.
Throughout Zardari’s political career, the shrewd politician has faced a raft of cases and remained in jail on various charges over the years.
Nicknamed “Mr 10%”, Zardari spent 11 years in jail on corruption charges before becoming the president in 2008. Although the allegations of corruption always chased him, the PPP co-chairperson and his party members have always maintained his innocence as neither has any graft charges proven against him, nor has he even been convicted by the courts.
Despite his tumultuous political career, Zardari made history by surrendering the powers of the president during his last stint.
It was Zardari, who being the president, had reduced his position to a ceremonial figurehead by removing the head of the state’s power to dissolve parliament, dismiss the premier, and appoint military chiefs when the then PPP government passed the 18th Constitutional Amendment in April 2010.
He also surrendered the power to appoint the chief election commissioner by substituting it with a mechanism that involved the opposition in the process.
All of these moves were not only unprecedented but showed Zardari’s vision and maturity as a politician.
With his permanent gleeful smile, his decision to involve political opponents in making constitutional appointments shows the kind of tolerance level he wishes to see in the country, which is otherwise engulfed by polarisation.
Before he cast his vote in the presidential election on Saturday, Zardari while responding to a question said parliament had acted properly in the past and he was just an “adviser”.

He was giving a hint that the ‘adviser’ had unfinished business in parliament that he would like to accomplish in his second stint.
Slogans of “Jeay Bhutto” and “Zinda Hai Bibi Zinda Hai [Long Live Bhutto] and [Bibi Is Alive]” were shouted in the National Assembly hall to remember the executed PPP founder and former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as well as his daughter, ex-PM Benazir Bhutto, when the presiding officer, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, announced the result of the presidential election.
Out of the 336-seat NA and 96-member Senate, Zardari obtained 255 votes while his opponent, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who was backed by the lawmakers of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which primarily comprised of PTI-backed members, received 119.
The members of the four provincial assemblies also voted at the chambers of their respective legislatures in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta.
In the Punjab Assembly, Zardari garnered 246 votes while Achakzai trailed with 100.
The Sindh Assembly results showed Zardari securing 151 votes against Achakzai's nine. In the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Achakzai bagged 91 votes while Zardari received 17.
Notably, in the Balochistan Assembly, Zardari received 47 votes while Achakzai failed to secure a single one from the province.
According to a notification issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following the poll, the ruling coalition’s candidate secured 411 votes, while the PTI-backed candidate received 181 votes from the Electoral College.
The total number of seats in the Electoral College was 1,185 out of which 92 were vacant, the ECP noted, adding that the remaining 1,093 voters were to exercise their right to vote.
The commission said 1,044 votes were cast – out of which nine were declared invalid.
Therefore, it pointed out that the total number of valid votes cast was 1,035.
“On the basis of [the] total valid votes cast in favour of each candidate, the result has been determined in the light of the provisions of paragraph-18 of the Second Schedule of the Constitution according to which, Mr. Asif Ail Zardari has secured 411 votes whereas Mr. Mehmood Khan Achakzai has secured 181 votes,” the notification read.
Zardari is expected to be sworn in on Sunday (today). It is expected that PM Shehbaz would also announce the names of his cabinet on the same day.
Zardari will then administer the oath of office to the new cabinet members, paving the way for the PML-N-led coalition government to practically begin its five-year long constitutional journey.
Amid rigging allegations as well other challenges ranging from economic troubles to political and security challenges, the Shehbaz-Zardari duo seems to be poised to deal with the problems as a united force.
However, only time will tell how far they can move together, especially, when they are nearly at the end of their political careers.

2,Oath-taking amidst legal dispute chaos,"AGP tells NA PHC order not binding on legislatures of Punjab, K-P and Balochistan","In an apparent bid to complete the electoral college before the presidential election, speakers at the National Assembly and the provincial legislature of Punjab on Friday administered oaths to new ruling parties’ lawmakers on additional reserved seats.
These oath-taking ceremonies were marred by loud protests by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) lawmakers, who described the move as illegal and a contempt of court.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on March 4 rejected an SIC’s request to allocate its reserved seats for women and minorities because of the failure of the party—which consists of PTI backed lawmakers—to submit a priority list for these seats prior to polls.
The polls oversight authority had noted that the reserved seats in the National Assembly shall not remain vacant and will be allocated by proportional representation process to other political parties.
The SIC had moved the Peshawar High Court (PHC) which on March 6 stayed the ECP notification. The party also moved the Lahore High Court (LHC) against the order but on Friday it failed to convene the court to stop ruling parties’ candidates from taking oath on seats, which, the SIC claimed, belonged to it.
The LHC rather deferred the matter till March 13 while issuing notices to respondents.
So when the NA sitting started on Friday, the SIC members tried to stop the speaker from continuing the session by pointing out the lack of a quorum. However, when the quorum was found in order, the speaker started administering oaths to four lawmakers elected on reserved seats amid a loud protest.
The SIC lawmakers argued that the PHC had ruled that lawmakers could not take oath on the reserved seats till further orders, saying administering oath was a violation of the court order.
PTI-SIC leader Omar Ayub said: “We condemn those who are forced upon us through Form-47 elections and will continue to do so until our full 180 members arrive at the assembly.”
Ayub also criticized the timing of the oath-taking, noting that on International Women's Day, unconstitutional oaths were taken, and the SIC was robbed of its women's seats.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan seconded Ayub and argued that PTI’s members in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies joined the SIC, expecting that the reserved seats based on their quota would be given to the party. However, he regretted, it did not happen.
“The ECP’s decision has been stayed by the PHC, making the oath-taking unlawful,” he said.
The speaker, while clarifying that the PHC order has not reached the speaker’s office yet, asked the Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman to explain the matter further.
The AGP while speaking on the floor of the house said that the PHC order was limited to the extent of the provincial lawmakers’ oath and it could not be applied to other provinces, especially when similar matters were pending before the courts concerned there.
Admitting that it would have been a contempt of court had the speaker administered oath to the lawmakers elected on reserved seats from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the AGP said no violation was committed by administering oaths to the lawmakers belonging to other areas.
Amidst protest, a resolution regarding International Women’s Day was passed with a majority vote. The session was then adjourned till 2pm on March 13 after the house also passed a resolution to hand over the Parliament House to the ECP on March 9 for presidential elections.
In the Punjab Assembly, the speaker also administered oath to 24 new lawmakers elected on reserved seats by virtue of the ECP’s March 4 order amid protests by the SIC members.
The MPAs who took oath on women’s seat were Sadia Muzaffar, Fiza Maimoona, Abida Bashir, Maqsoodan Bibi, Amira Khan, Somia Atta, Rahat Afza, Rukhsana Shafiq, Tahseen Fawad, Farzana Abbas, Shagufta Faisal, Uzma Butt, Maria Talal, Sajda Naveed, Nasreen Riaz, Afsheen Hasan, Amna Parveen, Shahr Bano, Zeba Ghafoor, Rubina Nazir and Syeda Sameera.
Tariq Masih, Waseem Anjum and Basru Ji were sworn in on minority seats.

3,Presidential election today despite postponement call,Coalition’s strength gives edge to Zardari; rival Achakzai seeks delay until reserved seats issue settled,"All is set for the country to elect its 14th president on Saturday (today), despite a call from Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the chief of the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) and the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) candidate, for postponing the vote.
The last presidential election took place on September 4, 2018, in which Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) Dr Arif Alvi defeated Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-backed Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and Aitzaz Ahsan of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
The president of Pakistan is elected through a secret ballot by an electoral college comprising members of the Senate, the National Assembly, and all four provincial assemblies. Voting is held in the National Assembly, the Senate, and the provincial assemblies.
The current ruling coalition, comprising the PML-N, the PPP, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), has backed former president Asif Ali Zardari, the co-chairman of the PPP. Given the strength of coalition parties, the election result is a forgone conclusion.
The required support and numbers are there, and it is going to be just a formality to elect Zardari, known as the ‘king of reconciliation’ and the one who knows that art of making the impossible possible, as president for the second time in a few days.
Achakzai is Zardari’s lone rival in the contest. In a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday, Achakzai highlighted the issue of vacant reserved seats for women and minorities in both the national and provincial assemblies.
The PkMAP chief argued that proceeding ahead with the election without filling these seats would be a violation of the law and the Constitution. “The election should be postponed until the electoral college is completed,” Achakzai stated.
Furthermore, Achakzai revealed that the SIC had submitted an application to the Peshawar High Court (PHC) regarding the reserved seats. However, there has been no change in the ECP schedule for polling, which will be held on Saturday (today) from 10am to 4pm.
Incumbent President Dr Arif Alvi is the country’s fourth democratically elected president to complete the five-year term. The three others were fifth president Fazal Elahi Chaudhary, from 1973 to 1978; 11th president Asif Zardari, from 2008 to 2013; and 12th president Mamnoon Hussain, from 2013 to 2018.
At present, Alvi is on an extended tenure after completing his five-year term on September 9 last year. Article 44(1) of the Constitution says that the president will hold office for a term of five years from the day he assumes charge, but he continues to hold the office until a successor is chosen.
This makes Alvi the first president to have an extended term due to an incomplete electoral college, as the National Assembly as well as the provincial assemblies stood dissolved when his term in office had concluded.
Meanwhile, the PPP continued the campaign for the re-election of Zardari for a second term. Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari spent a busy day meeting party leaders, first in Lahore early in the day and then throwing a reception for parliamentarians at the Sindh House in Islamabad.
In Lahore, Bilawal also met with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz after hosting a meeting with the Punjab Assembly members from coalition parties. In Islamabad, the reception hosted by Bilawal was also attended by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the parliamentarians belonging to the coalition parties.
Moreover, a PPP delegation led by former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani also met with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and urged him to revisit his party decision of boycotting the presidential election and vote for Zardari.
The president acts as a ceremonial figurehead. Though the president has no direct authority in running the government, he can directly grant pardons and reprieves, appoint higher commands in the military with support from the prime minister, and confirm judicial appointments, among other things.
Under Article 41(3) of the Constitution, the president is elected in a special session of parliament, the Senate, and all four provincial assemblies. The Electoral College of 692 votes from lawmakers includes 96 senators, 336 members of the National Assembly, and 260 votes from the four provincial assemblies.
Currently, the total number of lawmakers is 1,181, which includes 96 senators, 336 MNAs, and 749 legislators of the provincial assemblies. In order to ensure equal representation of the provinces, each provincial assembly is given 65 votes, equal to the smallest house in Balochistan.
The MNAs, senators, and Balochistan MPAs' votes are counted as one vote for each member. But with 371 MPAs, Punjab’s 5.7 members equal one vote; Sindh’s 2.58 members make one vote; and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s 2.2 members vote is counted as one.
Being the joint candidate of the upcoming ruling parties and having majority seats in Sindh and Balochistan assemblies, Zardari – who has earned the reputation of being the one who can turn the tables anytime – is set to enter the Presidency with an overwhelmingly majority.
SIC parliamentarians
Meanwhile, in a parliamentary meeting of the SIC, the opposition lawmakers were briefed on the presidential election as their hopes to clinch the highest office in the country remained tinged with anticipation.
During the meeting, it was stated that Achakzai would secure the votes of all assembly members affiliated with the SIC. However, concerns were raised about potential foul play in the voting process. “A government ally is going to get votes from the stolen mandate,” said Rana Aftab Ahmad Khan.
In a tribute to mark International Women’s Day, the parliamentary party honoured the resilience of women, who have faced adversities in their political struggles. Rana Shehbaz, the SIC chief whip, lamented the alleged theft of women’s seats from the SIC despite ongoing legal battles.
Similarly, expressing dissatisfaction with the proceedings, Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar remarked on the hasty administration of oaths despite the unresolved matter of reserved seats currently under court scrutiny.

4,PTI says 'king of corruption' imposed on nation,Achakzai describes presidential election as ‘historic’,"PTI leaders launched a verbal barrage on the ruling alliance on Saturday as the PPP Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari seized the presidential throne in what they termed an “illegal” election.
However, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the presidential candidate of the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), described the election as historic. He highlighted that for the first time, votes were not bought or sold during the polling process for the key post
Addressing the media outside the Parliament House after the election, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan took a direct jab at Zardari, referring to him as the “king of corrupt elements” and asserting that he is being imposed on the country.
Another PTI leader, Asad Qaiser, criticised the entire election process, deeming it controversial. Qaiser argued that presidential elections are illegal as legislatures are incomplete due to non-allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities to the SIC.
He added that the PTI is gearing up for a legal battle and will also seek justice from the people.
Barrister Ali Zafar, also speaking on the occasion, questioned how individuals were allowed to vote when the issue of reserved seats was still under court scrutiny.
PTI leaders contended that the ruling coalition has a history of acquiring positions through questionable means, claiming that Shehbaz Sharif also became the prime minister of the country by stealing elections.
PTI General Secretary Omar Ayub Khan accused those rejected by the people of being given positions in an illegitimate manner. Barrister Gohar emphasised that occupying constitutional positions unconstitutionally violates the Constitution.
He expressed concern over the growing influence of two prominent families, the Sharifs and Zardaris, not only on the country's resources but now on democratic institutions as well.
PTI leader Amir Dogar, addressing the gathering, asserted that the ruling coalition had stolen the PTI's mandate, labelling the elections as controversial.

In a statement, the PTI spokesperson announced a peaceful protest to be held across the country on Sunday (today), aiming to reclaim what he referred to as the 'stolen mandate.'
Earlier, Zardari, the ruling alliance's chosen candidate, clinched the presidency for the second time, dealing a blow to the PTI-supported Sunni Ittehad Council nominee Mahmood Khan Achakzai.
Speaking to journalists outside the Parliament House after the elections, Achakzai while thanking the PTI for supporting his candidacy, noted that the election took place in a wonderful environment.
""In this election, something unique happened. For the first time, votes were neither bought nor sold. Previously, members were considered commodities, but now there's a change, which is a positive development,"" he added.
Achakzai said some people believe everything in Pakistan can be bought and sold, but there are also those who oppose this notion. “I am grateful to be among those who oppose it.""
He mentioned that in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, all 90 members of Imran Khan's party voted for him. “In Punjab, too, all the party members voted for me. I received more votes in the National Assembly and Senate than the total number of SIC members. I am also thankful to all of them.”
The politician revealed that some lawmakers told him they wanted to vote for him but could not do so due to instructions from their party leaderships.
“A young lawmaker voted for me despite being warned by one of his colleagues that there are cameras [in the polling area] and he might be held accountable for voting against his party line,” he said. “The young man replied to his colleague that he had cast his vote and was ready to face the consequences.”
The opposition candidate stated that in the National Assembly and the Senate, people who were not members of the SIC also voted for him. “Someone was ill in Akhtar Mengal’s family, but he also stayed here and cast his vote,” he said.

5,Omar Ayub nominated for NA opposition leader,Nomination papers presented to NA speaker,"The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers, on Saturday picked Omar Ayub Khan for the position of opposition leader in the National Assembly.
The nomination was formally presented to the office of the National Assembly Speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
Malik Amir Dogar presented documents of Ayub’s nomination to the NA speaker.
Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Ali Muhammad Khan, Riaz Fatiana, and Dr Nisar Jat, among other opposition members, were also present on the occasion.
The realisation that the formal process of appointing a leader of the opposition had not been completed struck the PTI-SIC coalition during the National Assembly session on Friday.

It occurred when former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser urged the current NA Speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, to give the floor to the leader of the opposition, as was the tradition during Qaiser's tenure.
Qaiser pointed out that the opposition leader should be given the floor whenever demanded, as per past practice.
Sadiq, in response, questioned who had declared Omar Ayub as the opposition leader, humorously suggesting that Omar Ayub had assumed the role on his own.
The speaker guided the PTI-SIC lawmakers, stating that they needed to follow the formal process, and only then would Omar Ayub officially become the opposition leader.
As a result, officials from the PTI-SIC coalition promptly submitted the required documents to the speaker's office, ensuring that the necessary procedural steps were taken to formalise Omar Ayub Khan's candidacy for the position of Opposition Leader in the National Assembly.
