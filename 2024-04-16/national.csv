0,PM wants robust renewable energy plan to cut oil bill,Punjab government’s drive against power theft lauded.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed authorities concerned for robust renewable energy management to cut the country’s $27 billion oil import bill and improve the country’s existing electricity distribution system.
“Ultimately, we have to move to renewable energy. The oil import worth billions of dollars can be controlled by using alternative resources like solar, wind and hydel. Make cold calculations and I believe, you will be the winner in the long term,” the prime minister said while addressing a meeting held to review the power sector’s performance.
The prime minister said utilising renewable energy resources would also ensure riddance from the crude oil tanker mafia acting as parasites and eating up the national money. 
He pointed out that the country currently imports oil worth $27 billion to meet its power and transportation needs, a figure that could be significantly reduced by transitioning to alternative energy sources.

Punjab govt’s drive against power theft lauded

Talking about the ongoing drive against power theft, he lauded the performance of the Punjab government and expressed the hope that other provinces would also follow suit to overcome the challenge.
The prime minister said: “Streng­thening the country’s power transmission system requires utmost efforts and investment otherwise the power production and investments in the sector would go down the drain unless the flaws in the transmission network are removed.”
He asked the energy ministry to engage world-class consultants to suggest ways forward to the government to boost up the country’s power transmission system.
In a separate meeting, the prime minister directed officials concerned to take drastic measures including shifting of imported coal-run plants, improvement in power supply system, setting up cost effective and renewable energy plants and functioning of solar projects to reduce cost of electricity per unit thus benefiting the ordinary people.
Shift to local coal He directed for shifting of the imported coal-run power plants to local coal besides improving the power supply system. 
“In future, only clean, cost effective and renewable power plants should be set up in the country,” the prime minister said.
The meeting was apprised of 600MW solar power project and the prime minister directed for expediting work on the foreign investment in this regard.
The prime minister directed that the auction process of those power plants of Power Generation Companies (Gencos) that were lying dysfunctional and defective should be accelerated.
The meeting was briefed about the existing power generation capability, supply system and the government’s steps and proposals. 
The meeting was also apprised of the future power demand and supply in the country.
The meeting was informed that by shifting the coal-run power plants from imported fuel to local coal would not only save precious foreign exchange but would also make it possible to reduce power price by Rs2 per unit for consumers.
The prime minister directed for swift implementation of all measures within the stipulated timeframe.

1,Aseefa makes parliamentary debut amid noisy protest,Newly sworn-in MNA’s ‘unopposed’ victory challenged before SHC.,"


 
ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari on Monday made her debut in parliamentary politics by taking oath as a member of the National Assembly amid noisy protest by opposition members who were protesting against the speaker for omitting their agenda items from the orders of the day issued for the sitting. 
The opposition members had requisitioned the session to discuss the  issue of the letter written by six judges of Islamabad High Court (IHC)  regarding their alleged surveillance by the country’s intelligence  agencies and interference in the judicial matters.
Responding to the opposition’s protest, the speaker announced that he could not allow a debate on a sub judice matter.
Some of the protesting PTI members, carrying placards, gathered in front of the speaker’s dais when Aseefa was asked by the chair to sign the roll of members. To avoid any physical confrontation, a number of PPP women accompanied her to the rostrum. 

Newly sworn-in MNA’s ‘unopposed’ victory challenged before SHC

Dozens of PPP workers, who were sitting in the galleries, raised slogans like Zinda Hai BB (a term used for Benazir Bhutto) and Jiye Bhutto when Aseefa was signing the roll. On the way back to her seat, she received felicitations from a number of PPP leaders, including Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah who was present in the visitors’ gallery. 
She was also congratulated by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif before taking a seat beside her brother and party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. Later, she, Bilawal and some other PPP members left the house after realising that she might not be able to deliver her maiden speech, due to the opposition’s noisy protest.     
Aseefa had been elected unopposed from NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad (formerly Nawab­shah) on the seat that had been vacated by her father Asif Ali Zardari after becoming President.
Later, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq prorogued the session due to lack of quorum, which was pointed out by PPP’s Abdul Qadir Patel in protest against the opposition’s behaviour during Aseefa’s oath, and to deprive PTI members of the opportunity to take the floor.   
Speaking on a point of order, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar regretted the “unmannerly attitude” of the PTI members during Aseefa’s oath-taking.  
As soon as the speaker ordered a headcount after pointing out of the quorum — for which the presence of 84 members is required in the 336-member house — treasury members started exiting the chamber, leaving behind only the protesting opposition members. The speaker then read out the president’s prorogation order, declaring that the house was not in order as only 64 members were present. 
Victory challenged
Meanwhile, a PTI candidate petitioned the Sindh High Court challenging the victory of Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari from the NA-207 (Shaheed Benazirabad-I).
The petitioner Ghulam Mustafa Rind submitted that he had also filed nomination papers to run the by-election scheduled to be held on April 21. However, he asserted that the returning officer had rejected his candidature allegedly for concealing the acts in the nomination papers.
The petitioner claimed he had approached an election tribunal against the decision of RO and the tribunal had directed the petitioner to file an affidavit, but at the next hearing, the respondents filed a ‘fake’ and ‘unverified’ power bill before the tribunal. He alleged he was abducted by the Sakrand police when returning to his hometown after attending the hearing and police detained him for two days and an application was also filed before the court in this regard.
Mr Rind argued that the bill did not belong to him and his nomination papers were rejected with mala fide intent as the RO allegedly had close nexus with the PPP. 
He recalled that an identical petition was also filed before the SHC circuit bench in Hyderabad, but the same was withdrawn without the petitioner’s consent and maintained that since the rival candidate was influential, this petition may be decided at the principal seat of SHC.
Representing the petitioner, Wahab Baloch asked the SHC to set aside the RO order that declared her unopposed election from the constituency in question. 
He also pleaded to overturn the decision of RO for rejecting candidature of petitioner as well as the order of election tribunal about electricity dues.

2,Bushra alleges violation of her fundamental rights,Khawar Maneka’s lawyer continues arguments in Iddat case.,"ISLAMABAD: Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan, on Monday filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against alleged violations of her fundamental rights during her incarceration at Banigala sub-jail.
In her petition, Bushra Bibi contended that she was poisoned and subjected to psychological torture at her Banigala residence that has been declared a sub-jail.
She further stated in the petition that she is suffering from heartburn, aches in throat and mouth and that she believes that it is the result of eating poisonous meal.
Bushra Bibi further said that there is only one lady deputed in the sub-jail while the rest of the staff is male and she feels discomfort in such an environment.

Khawar Maneka’s lawyer continues arguments in Iddat case

Moreover, the petitioner said, the room in which she has been confined is bugged and spy cameras are installed there at different places, which is against the right of her privacy.
The petitioner said she has not been given ample time to meet her family members and lawyers.
The petition said Bushra Bibi has requested her shifting to Adiala Jail and a petition in this regard is still pending before the IHC.
The petitioner requested the court to order relevant authorities to ensure protection of her fundamental rights.
The petitioner further requested the court to allow her medical check-up from Shaukat Khanam Memorial Hosptial.
Iddat case
In the Iddat case, the counsel of complainant Khawar Farid Maneka continued his arguments in support of the conviction and the sentence awarded to former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi.
The counsel of Mr Khan, Salman Akram Raja, on the other hand urged the court to conclude the arguments of complainant’s counsel advocate Raja Rizwan Abbasi.
Mr Raja accused Mr Abbasi of applying delaying tactics in the case.
During the course of the arguments, Mr Abbasi read out the verdict of the trial court and said the key witnesses in the case were Mufti Saeed, who solemnised the Nikkah; Aun Chaudhry, a witness of the Nikkah ceremony; and Latif, a domestic servant of Khawar Maneka.
He said that the Section 496-B (fornication) was added in the charges against Mr Khan and his wife on the complaint of Mr Maneka, but the trial court deleted this offence during framing of the charges.
He argued that he would assist the trial court on Section 496 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and requested the court to adjourn the hearing till May. He said that he would require at least 4 to 5 hours to conclude the arguments.
Mr Raja on the other hand pointed out that if the trial would continue in late hours, the arguments on the appeal against conviction could continue after the regular court timings. He, however, asked judge Shahrukh Arjumand to give adjournment for a single day.
The judge responded that the courts have remained closed for Eid holidays and, therefore, he has workload for the entire week.
He adjourned the hearing of the case till April 24.
