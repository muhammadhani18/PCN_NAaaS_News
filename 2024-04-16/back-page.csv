0,SC decides not to  interfere in varsities’ admission policy,"Sets aside high court judgements, holds BTech is not equivalent to BSc.","ISLAMABAD: Educational institutions are independent to follow their own policy for admission and thus the academic, administrative and disciplinary autonomy of the university must be respected, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar observed on Monday, saying that interference by courts in their admission policies could give rise to glitches.
Justice Mazhar was a member of a three-judge Supreme Court bench, consisting of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Mussarat Hilali, that had taken up a set of appeals against the Peshawar High Court orders of Feb 21, 2013 and Oct 7, 2013 and Lahore High Court’s Jan 17, 2017 order.
Except for Oct 7 PHC order, all the high court judgements were set aside by the Supreme Court.
The appeals were filed by the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and Taj Muhammad Khan of Multan Electric Power Company.

Sets aside high court judgements, holds BTech is not equivalent to BSc

The issue emerged when Muhammad Sadiq, a respondent in one of the cases, applied for admission in MSc Engineering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar. During scrutiny it was revealed that the respondent did not possess the pre-requisite qualification for admission to the MSc programme since, according to the university rules, the qualification of B.Tech (Hons) was not considered equivalent to BSc Engineering.
The respondent had filed a petition in the PHC, which was allowed on Feb 21, 2013.
Likewise, in another case, one of the appellants obtained a B.Tech degree from KP University of Engineering and Technology and applied for recruitment for the post of assistant executive engineer (BPS-17) in Pakistan Railways’ civil engineering department.
The candidature of the appellant was provisionally accepted and he was told to provide his registration certificate to the PEC, but he failed to do so, resulting in the rejection of his candidature.
The appellant had filed a petition in the PHC which was dismissed on Oct 7, 2013.
The third case concerned the filing of a petition before the LHC in which the petitioner holding a B.Tech (Hons) in Electrical (Power) Technology challenged allocation of seats.
Authored by Justice Mazhar, the judgement said the educational institutions were competent to manage their own affairs without any outside intervention from executive or judicial organs, unless they contravene or disregard the compass of their authority or act in breach of applicable statutes or admission policies as laid down in the prospectus.
“Nothing on record shows that while cancelling admission of the respondent in the first case, the university committed any act in violation of their rules and regulations. The petitioner failed to achieve the admission criteria and hence, he was not entitled to admission.
“It was neither fair nor just or equitable to interfere in the affairs falling into the exclusive domain of the university and its academia and, therefore, the PHC was not justified to intervene in the admission policy which does not seem to be discriminatory or unlawful, but a fair benchmark for applying for admission in the MSc degree programme,” the verdict said.
The judgement cited a Nov 15, 2019 decision by the Higher Education Commission’s (HEC) Equivalence and Accreditation Committee declaring that degrees of BSc (Engineer) and B.Tech (Hons) were not equivalent, but could be considered on a par for employment, grade, promotion, etc. in their respective cadre/streams.
The SC judgement said the criteria set for admission explained that both degrees — BSc (Engineering) and B.Tech (Hons) — were distinct with the rider that if a person who qualified B.Tech (Hons) applied for admission to Engineering Bachelor’s degree programme offered by engineering institutions and universities, he can avail certain exemptions subject to assessment of courses and satisfying PEC regulations.
“Thus the gist of documents placed before us unequivocally demonstrate that the degree of B.Tech (Hons) is not equivalent to BE degree, but both are two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of engineering and technology with distinct syllabi and programme objectives but may be treated at a par for recruitment, pay scales and grades.
“The Bachelor of Science in Engineering emphasises theories and advanced concepts, while an Engineering Technology degree emphasises hands-on application and implementation with the major difference that BE is more knowledge-based while B.Tech is skill-oriented,” the judgement explained.

1,Iranian foreign ministry says vessel seized for violating maritime laws,Tehran in contact with Islamabad to confirm if any Pakistanis among crew.,"ISLAMABAD / DUBAI: A Portuguese-flagged container ship, the MSC Aries, was seized by Iran on April 13 for “violating maritime laws”, Iran’s foreign ministry said on Monday, while its mission in Pakistan said it was working to confirm if there were indeed any Pakistani nationals on board the vessel.
The Revolutionary Guards had seized the cargo vessel in the Strait of Hormuz last week, days after Tehran vowed to retaliate for a suspected Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus on April 1.
Iran had said it could close the crucial shipping route in response.
Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported that a Guards helicopter had boarded the MSC Aries and taken it into Iranian waters.

Tehran in contact with Islamabad to confirm if any Pakistanis among crew

On Saturday, Iran launched a barrage of missiles and explosive drones in its first direct attack on Israeli territory, a strike that Tehran said was an act of self-defence following the bombing of its consulate.
“The vessel was diverted into Iran’s territorial waters as a result of violating maritime laws and not answering calls made by Iranian authorities,” spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by Reuters as saying, adding that Iran was certain the vessel was linked to Israel.
MSC, which operates the Aries, confirmed Iran had seized the ship and said it was working “with the relevant authorities” for its safe return and the wellbeing of its 25 crew.
MSC leases the Aries from Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime, the latter said in a statement, adding that MSC is responsible for all the vessel’s activities. Zodiac is partly owned by Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer.
Pakistani crew
Meanwhile, the Iranian mission in Pakistan said on Monday that it could not yet confirm whether any Pakistani nationals or sailors were on board the seized ship.
Sharing a statement from Tehran’s ambassador in Islamabad, a spokesperson told Dawn they had received details about the Pakistani citizens through Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday, and conveyed them to their capital.
“We are following the issue in contact with the Iranian and Pakistani foreign ministries,” the statement said, adding that they were awaiting a response from Tehran.
Media reports suggested that at least two Pakistanis were on board the MSC Aries, with the ship’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Muhammad Adnan Aziz being one of them.
According to Geo News, family sources close to Mr Aziz said he was in fact on the seized vessel. They also claimed to have approached the Foreign Office to seek his safe return.
There are also said to be around 17 Indians on board, and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is said to be in contact with his Iranian counterpart to secure their release.
Shipping disruption
Reuters quoted Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers’ Federation, the leading seafarers’ union, as saying that “innocent seafarers must be protected from escalating conflicts they have no role in instigating, nor power to resolve”.
The International Chamber of Shipping called the seizure a “flagrant breach of international law and an assault on freedom of navigation”.
Patrick Verhoeven, managing director of the International Association of Ports and Harbors, said the seizure of the MSC Aries “has the potential to further disrupt cargo transits in and out of the region, which will impact all of our member ports, one way or another”.

2,Trump’s ‘unprecedented’ criminal trial opens,Republican nominee for 2024 presidential race seeks to spin his criminal cases as ‘proof of persecution’,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump’s New York criminal trial opened on Monday in a historic first for a US ex-president and a seismic twist to an already explosive 2024 presidential election, where the scandal-plagued Republican is seeking to return to power.
“Good morning Mr Trump,” Judge Juan Merchan said to the defendant in the courtroom, where the Republican sat with hunched shoulders and a stern expression.
Trump, wearing his trademark red tie, white shirt and blue suit, strode into the courtroom, walking past nine rows of wooden benches and took his seat.
The 77-year-old is accused of falsifying business records in a scheme to cover up an alleged extramarital encounter with adult film actress Stormy Daniels to shield his 2016 election campaign from a last-minute upheaval.

Republican nominee for 2024 presidential race seeks to spin his criminal cases as ‘proof of persecution’

The so-called hush money affair is one of four criminal cases hanging over Trump, including historic prosecutions against the Republican’s alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 election and prevent the winner, Joe Biden, from taking office.
If convicted in the hush money case, Trump would potentially face years in prison, but legal observers consider this unlikely. Even so, the prospect of Trump becoming a convicted felon throws an unprecedented wild card into an already unpredictable November 5 election, where he wants to defeat Biden and retake the White House.
The hard-right populist is running on dark vows of “vengeance” and seeking to spin his criminal cases as evidence of persecution.
Trump is accused of illegally covering up remittances to his longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, who was using the funds to pay Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about the alleged sexual encounter in the final days of the 2016 election campaign.
Trump, who claims he will not get a fair trial in heavily Democratic New York, denies the charges and says the encounter with Clifford and another with a Playboy nude model did not happen.
Even if convicted, the ex-president would be able to appeal and would not be barred from continuing to run, or even being elected president.
Over 50 prospective jurors excused from trial
While 96 potential panelists were assembled in the New York court to be screened for their ability to fairly judge Trump, more than 50 prospective jurors were excused from the landmark trial after they said they would not be able to try him fairly and impartially.
Selection of 12 jurors could go on as long as two weeks, according to one of Trump’s lawyers.
One prospective juror, a woman with short hair, said “I just couldn’t do it” as she left the courtroom. Jurors must answer a questionnaire including checks on whether they have been members of far-right groups associated with Trump.

3,Bishop among four wounded in yet another Sydney knife attack,Two police officers injured in unrest after church assault hospitalised,"SYDNEY: Just two days after the killing of six people in a knife attack at a shopping mall in Sydney, at least four people, including a bishop, were injured in another knife attack at a church during a service on Monday, triggering clashes between angry residents and police.
While officers arrested a suspect and took him to an undisclosed location in Wakeley, about 30km west of Sydney’s central business district, a large crowd quickly gathered outside the church after the attack, throwing rocks at police and demanding they bring out the perpetrator, according to two witnesses.
Police fired pepper spray as they pushed back people onto nearby streets, according to a Reuters journalist.
Australian police said at least two officers had been hospitalised and vehicles were damaged in community unrest after a knife attack at an Assyrian church in Sydney.

Two police officers injured in unrest after church assault hospitalised

The church leader suffered non-life-threatening injuries in the attack, which was carried out during a service at an Assyrian church called Christ The Good Shepherd Church.
Videos of the incident circulating online showed the bishop of the church, Mar Mari Emmanuel, standing at the altar of the church and speaking to worshippers as another man wearing a black jumper walks towards him and attacks him.
Horrified members of the congregation scream as the man stabs the priest several time in the chest, the videos show.
The motive of the attack is unknown.
The New South Wales ambulance service said at least four people were injured including a man in his 50s who was taken to hospital in a serious condition.
The attack drew condemnation from figures in the city’s Jewish and Muslim communities.

4,Israel releases 150 Palestinians as region remains tense,Gaza authorities claim mistreatment of detainees; US says new truce deal on table for both sides.," 

A WOMAN stands with expressions of despair amidst the rubble of a collapsed building at Maghazi camp in central Gaza, on Monday.—AFP

PALESTINIAN TERRIT­ORIES: Israel on Monday released around 150 detainees taken from the Palestinian territory, Gaza’s crossing authority said, alleging that they were mistreated in detention.
Israel continued its assault on Gaza and launched dozens of air strikes overnight as tensions in the region remain high over fear of a wider escalation of the conflict.
World powers have urged restraint after Iran on Saturday launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel.
The latest detainees to be released were taken to Israel and returned via the Kerem Shalom border crossing before some were treated in a hospital in Rafah, in the south of the besieged territory, according to the Gaza crossings authority and an AFP journalist.

Gaza authorities claim mistreatment of detainees; US says new truce deal on table for both sides

“It is very noticeable that there is severe mistreatment of these prisoners, as a number of them were sent to Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital for treatment,” the spokesman for the Gaza Crossings Authority, Hisham Adwan, told AFP.
The Israeli military did not comment on the release of these detainees but said the mistreatment of those in detention was “absolutely prohibited”.
“Those who are not involved in terrorist activity are released back to the Gaza Strip,” the military told AFP in a statement.
Overnight strikes
The Hamas government media office said Israeli aircraft launched “dozens” of strikes overnight on central Gaza.
Israel has said it will not be distracted from the war after Iran’s unprecedented attack heightened fears of wider conflict.
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said late Sunday that rescuing prisoners was “our critical mission”.
Hamas is still holding the prisoners in, Hagari said of the roughly 130 people, including 34 presumed dead, who Israel says remain in the hands of the Palestinian group since the attack on Oct 7.
The Israeli army said it was “calling up approximately two reserve brigades for operational activities on the Gazan front” about a week after withdrawing most ground troops from the territory.
Truce deal ‘on the table’
Late on Saturday, Hamas said it had submitted its response to a truce plan presented by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators at talks that started in Cairo on Apr 7.
The group said it was sticking to its previous demands, insisting on “a permanent ceasefire” and the withdrawal of the Israeli army.
Israel’s Mossad spy agency called this a rejection of the proposal, accusing Hamas of “continuing to exploit the tension with Iran” and aiming for “a general escalation in the region”.
However, the United States said mediation efforts continue.
“We’re not considering diplomacy dead there,” said the National Security Council’s Kirby.
“There’s a new deal on the table… It is a good deal” that would see some hostages released, fighting halted and more humanitarian relief into Gaza, Kirby said.
Desperate to return to their homes, thousands of displaced Palestinians headed towards an Israeli checkpoint on the coastal road on Sunday after rumours that it was reopened.
Israel has denied the rumours.
Hoping to reunite with his wife, who has been in the southern city of Khan Yunis, Palestinian man Mahmoud Awdeh said, “She told me over the phone that people are leaving… she’s waiting at the checkpoint until the army agrees to let her head to the north”.
Retaliation fears
Hostilities between Israel and Iran’s regional allies have flared since the outbreak of the war in Gaza after Hamas’s Oct 7 attack.
The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday following the Iranian attack, where Israel pressed for new sanctions against Tehran and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the region was “on the brink” of war.
“Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,” the UN chief said.
Iran’s UN envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, insisted the Islamic Republic was exercising its “inherent right to self-defence” to respond to the Apr 1 strike on Tehran’s consular building in Damascus, which has been widely attributed to Israel.
