0,Capital back to business after Eid celebrations,"Despite lingering travel fatigue, the capital’s populace transitions back to work","The capital city has embraced normalcy, with the majority of natives returning after celebrating the religious festival of Eidul Fitr in their inbred towns with relatives to join their daily engagements.
After celebrations of Eidul Fitr, following the conclusion of the holy month of Ramazan, the natives as well as the locals are now transitioning back to their routines, as significant attendance was observed in the public and private offices and educational institutions.
Although many of the employees and students have resumed their official and academic engagements, respectively, many still could not join their daily activities due to tiredness after travelling back from their ancestral towns.
The majority of the population of Islamabad, comprised of people belonging to different parts of the country who are settled here for jobs, education, or business purposes, prefers to celebrate the festivals of Eid with their relatives in their home towns.
The three Eid holidays from Wednesday to Friday announced by the government compelled the officials to take leave on Monday and Tuesday to club weekends back and forth with Eid holidays to spend more time with their families.
Kamran Khan, a resident of G-8/1, said, “Most of the natives prefer to celebrate the religious festival of Eidul Fitr in their hometowns. Now, the hustle and bustle of the city is reviving after Eid, with its residents coming back from their native towns.”
“I managed to get leave on Monday and Tuesday before the Eid holidays and left for my hometown on Friday, enjoying around ten days with my parents, making this Eid memorable as I would get an opportunity to visit them on Eid,” he said.
Muhammad Yar, who is settled in Islamabad due to a government job and only visits his native town occasionally, said, “It is important to bring children to our home town to spend maximum time with all family members to have a strong bond.”
“I wish my children to remain connected with our roots, native language, traditions, and culture so that they can adopt those deep-rooted values that are essential to becoming good humans,” he said.
The federal capital wears a deserted look during the Eid festivals as most of the natives move to their hometowns to celebrate such festive occasions with their loved ones, while most of the markets and restaurants also remain closed.
The educational institutions in the city have also opened after Eid vacations, and students, after enjoying detailed visits to their home towns, are ready to focus on their academic routine along with sharing details of their Eid celebrations and participating in Eid Milan parties.
“I was excited on the first day of school today after vacations as me and my friends shared stories of our Eid celebrations and had great fun,” Sarfaraz, a student in Grade III, said. “After enjoying vacations, I will be more enthusiastic about my studies with a fresh mind,” he added.
Contrary to the previous traditions, a number of the food outlets and shopping malls remained open during the Eid days, and the majority visited these due to the rainy weather outside.
The public transport plying between the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi was seen as very limited during the Eid holidays, but now the hustle and bustle of the cities has been restored with the culmination of the holidays.

1,Seven naanbais held for overcharging customers,"Authorities also fine 68 violators, seal four tandoors in Rawalpindi","At least seven naanbais were arrested for selling roti (plain bread) against the price of Rs16 per roti set by the Punjab government.
The authorities also imposed a fine of Rs170,000 on 68 violators for charging above the stipulated price and also sealed four ovens/tandoors.
The district administration issued a notification fixing the prices of roti and naan at Rs16 and Rs20 for a standard serving size of 120 grams.
The district administrations across Punjab, including Rawalpindi, are actively enforcing these regulations. However, despite these measures, associations representing naanbais have rejected the price reduction, citing the absence of corresponding decreases in the costs of petrol, diesel, and electricity. They have announced their intent to continue selling roti and naan at previous rates.
Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner, Hassan Waqar Cheema, affirmed the commitment of price magistrates in the district to enforce the government-mandated prices for roti and naan. Over the last 24 hours, more than 100 tandoor shops were inspected, leading to the identification of 68 violators.
Cheema reiterated the determination of authorities to uphold the mandated prices for roti and naan, emphasising that compliance would be ensured without compromise.
Federal govt reduces prices
On Tuesday, in response to this initiative of the Punjab government, the federal capital also reduced the prices of roti and naan by fixing their prices at Rs16 and Rs20 respectively, however, and naanbais kept their prices while refusing to obey the government order.
Assistant Commissioners and Price Control Magistrates have been tasked with ensuring the enforcement of these new prices across Islamabad.
In line with Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon's instructions, Assistant Commissioner Secretariat Abdullah Khan convened a meeting with the Nanbai Association to discuss the implementation of the revised prices. Despite these efforts, tandoors/naanbais in the twin cities are standing firm on their prices, declining to reduce them as per the government's rates.
A citizen named Muhammad Tassawar, a resident of the Sohan area lamented the lack of reduction in prices at local tandoors and naanbaiss, where roti was still being sold at Rs20 and naan at Rs25. Similarly, Shabeer Hussain from the G-8 area, highlighted that despite the government's intervention, tandoors and naanbais in the federal capital were selling Roti at Rs25 and naan at Rs 30, placing a financial burden on the residents.
When contacted by the ICT Spokesman, Dr Abdullah Tabassum, he assured that strict action would be taken against those violating the price regulations. He emphasised that assistant commissioners and magistrates have been assigned specific tasks to ensure compliance with the new roti and naan prices in Islamabad.
Case registered
Rawalpindi Police filed a case against Shafiq Qureshi, the central president of the All Pakistan Naanbai Association for releasing a video statement against the notification of roti price reduction.
Bani police registered a case based on the complaint filed by Head Constable Rizwan Zafar. Qureshi had released a video statement opposing a notification from the Punjab government. He had been missing since Sunday, and the First Information Report surfaced on Monday (Yesterday).
A case has been registered against Shafiq Qureshi under Section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order.

2,Liaquat Bagh falls into despair,"Authorities, PPP leadership draw citizens’ ire over poor upkeep of fame site","Liaquat Bagh, the site where former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was martyred, has unfortunately fallen into a state of neglect and disrepair due to what is being described as complete negligence and carelessness by the authorities concerned and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
This has led to the transformation of the site into a dumping ground for garbage, a stark contrast to its significance as a place of remembrance.
Central leaders of the PPP in Rawalpindi, including Raja Kamran, Shahid Pappu, District President Chaudhary Zaheer, Aamir Fida Paracha, Malik Khalid Nawaz Bobi, Babar Sultan Jadoon, and Banaras Chaudhary, along with their colleagues, have reportedly been absent from addressing the deteriorating condition of the martyrdom site.
Instead, their focus seems to be on other political engagements, such as visits to the President's House and Senate House.
The deterioration of the martyrdom site is evident, with dozens of tiles broken and scattered. Over the past ten days, garbage collectors have been depositing waste collected from the streets at this site, mistakenly viewing the shed area as a suitable location.
This garbage is sometimes sold off when it accumulates, only to resume the dumping cycle at the site.
Local leaders and workers affiliated with the PPP have not visited the site for weeks, leading to its transformation into a dumping ground. This negligence has drawn strong criticism from long-time party workers, who recall promises made by Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani and former Interior Minister Rehman Malik to construct a memorial for Benazir Bhutto at the site, along with funding commitments that have not materialized over the past 16 years.
The state of the martyrdom site has become a cause of concern not just for party workers but also for the broader community. Garbage accumulation, broken tiles, and the presence of drug addicts at night have created an unsafe and unsightly environment. The failure to address these issues has prompted demands for the dismissal of city and district PPP organizations and immediate action on constructing the promised memorial.
In response to the growing criticism, Senior Vice President of PPP City Iftikhar Chaudhary has pledged to rectify the situation and fulfil the promise of building a national monument at the martyrdom site. However, this announcement comes amidst frustration and disappointment among those who expected timely action and proper upkeep of this important historical site.

4,"‘Healthy Mother, Healthy Child’ awareness drive ends",Women encouraged to prioritise breastfeeding over formula milk,"A one-week intensive awareness campaign, under which 6,000 women were registered in the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) from the Rawalpindi division, has come to an end.
The initiative was aimed at advocating for maternal and child health and promoting breastfeeding and ensuring access to nutritious food. The slogan for the drive was to promote the idea of ‘healthy mother and healthy.
To achieve the target, women were encouraged to prioritise breastfeeding over formula milk and ensure the consumption of nutritious food. A full awareness campaign was conducted for the development programme under the Facilitation Centre to be established in Tehsil Headquarters of Kahuta, Murree, Kotli Satian, Wah Cantt, Gujar Khan, Kalar Syedan.
Under the supervision of Dr Naveed Malik, Coordinator of the Integrated Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Health and Nutrition Programme (IRMNCH), and with support from Monitoring Officer Junaid, a series of activities were organised from April 1st to April 6th. These activities targeted pregnant women registered under BISP and those seeking registration, providing financial assistance and health guidelines for themselves and their children.
Over 200 sessions were conducted across various centres, complemented by walk-in seminars at 30 locations and awareness campaigns in educational institutions. Central to the message was the importance of breastfeeding over formula milk for infant health, alongside advocating for a nutritious diet during pregnancy and postpartum.
Dr Naveed Malik stressed the aim of enrolling 20,000-22,000 breastfeeding women into the BISP, offering financial aid for medications and nutritious food while discouraging the use of formula milk. Lady health workers were actively engaged in disseminating awareness regarding the importance of breastfeeding. Dr Malik said that women enrolled in the BISP are taught about the advantages of breastfeeding, which guarantees the well-being of both mothers and their children.
Dr Ijaz Ahmed, Chief Executive Officer of the District Health Authority (DHA), highlighted the significance of the mother and child development programme within BISP. With community support, DHA is operating eight Facilitation Centres for new registrations and reaching out to women already enrolled.

5,Employers ‘torture’ teenage house help,"Accusing their maid of theft, the owners tormented maid and her family","Owners of a house in a private housing society brutally torture maid, husband and 14-year-old son on allegations of theft within the limits of Rawat Police station.
The owners, along with their two sons and four unknown persons, demonstrated inhumane behaviour by tormenting their house maid, her husband and her 14-year-old son.

Aqila, the maid, stated in her police report that she had been working as a domestic worker in the residence of Masmat Farzana Naveed in a private housing society for the past two and a half years. She reported that in the last week of March, their house was burgled.
Five days after the incident, the owner started accusing her, the maid described. She said that she tried to defend herself by pointing out that she had been working for so long and they had never had any complaints before.
She also stated that during the evenings, her husband used to accompany her because it would often get late, and she would have to return with him.
One day, when Aqila had already returned from work, Naveed, the husband of Masmat called and asked her to come back. Aqila then along her husband and 14-year-old son went back to their house.
She claimed that, once they were at the house, her employers separated my husband and son from me and started torturing them by stripping them naked. Hearing the cries of her husband and son, she began to plead with them, asking them to stop.
Masmat then grabbed her and took her to the upper floor, where, her two sons, Abbas and Baqir, and four unknown persons were also present. These people posed as CIA employees and they subjected her to severe torture while repeatedly threatening to shoot her while also making videos of her naked son being subjected to severe torture.
They kept threatening them, asking the maid and her family to admit to having burgled their house. They then took them to an unknown bungalow where there were other unknown armed persons waiting.

7,FBR officer abducted from Rawalpindi,Kidnappers demand Rs10 million ransom from officer’s family,"A Grade 18 officer of the Inland Revenue Service of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has been abducted from Rawalpindi.
Kidnappers have abducted grade 18 officer, Rehmatullah Khan and are holding him for ransom. The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of Rs10 million from the FBR officer's family.
An FIR has been registered for the kidnapping of FBR officer. The FIR has been filed by Muhammad Shafiq, the brother-in-law of the abductee. The Express Tribune has obtained a copy of the FIR.
According to the FIR, Inland Revenue Service Grade 18 officer Rehmatullah Khan is posted at the FBR headquarters. He was abducted by unknown persons at 11:30am on April 12.
Khan had left the house saying that he was going to congratulate his friends on Eid but failed to return. Despite his family’s attempts to locate him, he could not be traced.
Muhammad Shafiq, the brother-in-law of the abductee communicated that all efforts had been made to contact and trace the victim, but due to his mobile phone being switched off since April 12, no contact could be established with Khan.
However, Shafiq did report that when Khan’s phone next connected, he had received a call from a Sindhi-speaking person asking for a ransom of Rs10 million. The abductors said that Rehmatullah Khan was in their custody in the katcha area of Ghotki.
The early recovery of the abducted officer is a challenge for the FBR chairman, as the abduction of an FBR officer has caused great anxiety among other officers.
The abduction case will adversely affect all other officers and officials who are playing a key role in tax collection in all the field offices.

8,Citizens lose billions to illicit housing project,"Koral police register 146 cases of fraud, illegal occupation and firing against project owners","The victims of a private housing scheme located near the Islamabad Highway Expressway have touched thousands in numbers, forcing the police to take up a pile of complaints of fraud and cheating against the owner and employees.
The Koral SP has launched a formal investigation into the complaints of scams worth billions of rupees and started collecting data while hearing the victims regularly.
Sources further said that among these thousands of victims, most of the victims are those who have been sold the same plot file many times.
The scary aspect of the private housing society, Ghori Town, is that at least 50 cases of fraud have already been registered against its main owner Chaudhry Abdul Rehman and more are pending, while a total of 146 cases of fraud, cheating, illegal occupation and firing have been registered against other owners of the society in the Koral police station.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the Koral police have registered 35 cases of fraud against Chaudhry Ramzan, the alleged frontman of Abdul Rahman. Similarly, 45 cases of fraud and fighting have been lodged against Abdul Rehman’s partner Raja Salman and 11 cases against his brother Raja Jahangir. Furthermore, five cases of fraud and fighting have been registered against Chaudhry Junaidur Rahman, son of Abdul Rehman.
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has also officially advertised in a section of the media, asking the victims to submit their documents so that the reference against 23 people involved in the fraud could be finalised.
The victims say that they have been being humiliated by society’s operators for the last 15 years. “I was in Saudi Arabia and the land mafia seized my property. On my return, I was booked in a false case when demanded my property back. I was sent to jail,” Haji Waris, an affected citizen said. He fears that if the NAB or the Capital Development Authority (CDA) does not take timely action, the accused will flee abroad with the looted money.
Sources in the Housing Societies Department of the CDA said that this society is completely illegal and the authority has sealed it several times in the past. Later after seeing the problems of the public, it was reopened.
A senior CDA officer, requesting anonymity, said that the housing society is a challenge for the authority but thousands of people have already built residential properties there. The CDA always keeps the public interest in view, however, whenever NAB or any other agency come forward for action, the society’s management, and the nominated accused would go to jail and the victims would get their compensation.
