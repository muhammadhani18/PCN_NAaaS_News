0,Car involved in hit-and-run in Karachi recovered from MPA’s farmhouse,"On April 8, an eight-year-old boy was killed and his mother injured when the fast-moving car hit them in Gulshan-i-Iqbal and sped away.","KARACHI: A Mercedes involved in a fatal accident recently was found from the farmhouse of a Pakistan Peoples Party MPA and former police officer, it emerged on Monday.
On April 8, an eight-year-old boy was killed and his mother injured when the fast-moving car hit them in Gulshan-i-Iqbal near Maskan Chowrangi and sped away.
East-SSP Dr Farrukh Raza said Bibi Nauria and her son, Syed Yusuf Agha, were crossing the road when they were run over by the driver.
A case was registered on the complaint of Syed Ahmedullah, who said that his sister-in-law along with her son was crossing main Allama Shabbir Usmani Road, opposite KFC in Block-7, when a Mercedes car hit them due to negligence of the driver, who fled along with the vehicle after the incident.
The police recovered the said car from the farmhouse of PPP MPA Farooq Awan, who is a former SSP.
In a video being shared on social media, the victim’s father, Syed Mohammed Agha, who was present at the farmhouse when the car was recovered, could be heard saying that the MPA had given his farmhouse to the suspects for ‘hiding’ the car. He wondered how the lawmaker could give protection to such people.
MPA Awan did not respond to Dawn’s attempts to seek his version.
However, a section of the media quoted him as having said that the car belonged to his friend’s son, Furqan. He also claimed that the car had been parked at his farmhouse without informing him. The former SSP said that he has been the owner of the farmhouse for the last 10 years.
He said his friend Zahid lived in Japan and used to import cars which were usually parked at the farmhouse.
Meanwhile, the opposition PTI demanded that MPA Awan be made part of the police investigation.

• Says snatching of cell phones becomes multi-billion rupees ‘crime industry’
• Wahab says Muttahida doing politics in the name of street crime
KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Monday questioned the role of police in curbing the menace of street crime and said that snatching of cell phones had become a multi-billion rupees industry in the metropolis and apparently criminals had been enjoying patronage from law enforcers ‘due to high stakes’.
It also blamed the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government in Sindh for conniving with criminals and warned the PPP that it could take to the streets if the law and order situation in Karachi was not improved.
However, the PPP took exception to the MQM-P’s invitation to the Centre in a provincial matter and accused it of “politicising” a public issue for its vested interests and
On Monday, MQM-P leaders Nasreen Jalil, nominated leader of the opposition in the Sindh Assembly Ali Khurshidi and others held a press conference and termed street crime in Karachi a Rs11bn “industry”.
They wanted the federal government to “move fast and make decision to intervene before it’s too late”, saying that the law and order in Karachi was worsening with each passing day and the situation was “slipping out of everyone’s hands”.
On an average, he claimed, the city witnessed snatching of some 1,000 cell phones everyday worth Rs30 million, which is around Rs10.80 billion annually. That, he added, made the “industry” a lucrative business both for the criminals as well as those who were supposed to stop them, that is, Sindh police.
He said street crime was “a racket” being operated from the city which contributed over 70 per cent in national exchequer and shared almost 95pc revenue of the total of the province. The value of the “industry” and “smooth operation” of the armed bandits, he said, raised many questions about the performance, impartiality and role of the police force in Karachi which “at times come under doubt.”
“Ultimately, when you see the situation of street crime and that police have failed to ensure security of the people, then a question emerges in the back of the mind: are they [Sindh police] facilitating this [street crimes] industry? It’s time to ponder,” said Mr Khurshidi.
In the first three months of 2024 alone, 59 people have lost their lives whereas 200 have been injured while resisting robbers across the city. During Ramazan alone, 19 people were killed by armed bandits in Karachi, where more than 6,700 incidents of snatching were recorded in the metropolis during the holy month.
The MQM-P leaders, while hinting at taking to the streets if the federal and provincial governments failed to pay heed to its concerns, also demanded compensations for the families of the victims of street crime.
“We have already filed a resolution in the Sindh Assembly against these crimes and whenever the session is summoned, you would see us putting our case strongly,” he said. “We have already raised this issue in the National Assembly. And we ask the federal government as well as to when they would intervene in this situation? Are you waiting for more people to die or the situation slips out of hands?”, he asked.
Expressing her concerns, senior MQM-P leader Nasrin Jalil said that the metropolis was actually “stormed” by armed bandits and Karachiites had never felt so helpless in front of those criminals.
“The people here are tired of carrying dead bodies. It is not in our power to stop the anger of the people,” she said. “On the other hand, we believe that the government should announce compensation for those who have been killed in street crime incidents. Many of them were sole breadwinners of their families. The government should make it a policy to take care of the families of those who fall victim to street crimes.”
PPP reaction
Meanwhile, the PPP-led Sindh government reacted strongly to the MQM-P’s claims and allegations.
Minutes after the party’s press conference, Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab Siddiqi and Sindh Minister Nasir Shah issued separate statements, calling the MQM-P’s claims an attempt of “damage control” through fake claims as it was facing “disintegration.”
“It’s an old issue of the MQM-P,” said Barrister Wahab, who’s also the spokesman of the Sindh government. “Whenever the party faces crisis and disintegration, it comes under panic and starts doing strange things. The MQM-P allegations are nothing but point scoring in the name of street crime,” he said.
“The Sindh government is committed to eliminate crimes both in rural and urban Sindh. Even today [Monday], the home minister and Sindh IG are in Larkana, chairing a meeting to plan action against criminals in the rural areas,” he added.
Both Mayor Wahab and Minister Nasir Shah questioned the policy of the MQM-P which, he said, on one hand demanded empowered local government system and power at grassroots level and on the other asked the federal government to intervene for restoration of law and order.
“The MQM-P has always pursued a politics of hatred and the party is politically isolated. The people of Karachi still remember the days of loot, plunder and oppression,” they added.

2,Held suspect found dead in Darakhshan police lock-up,"KARACHI: A man, held for his alleged involvement in an extortion case on Sunday, died in police custody on Monday...","KARACHI: A man, held for his alleged involvement in an extortion case on Sunday, died in police custody on Monday under controversial circumstances. 
Police said that suspect Junaid was arrested for allegedly demanding protection money from Seaview resident Abdul Basit.
He was brought to the Darakhshan police station and kept in the lock-up. However, he was found dead on Monday, the police said.
The police claimed that apparently the suspect died of a heart attack.
However, the body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for a post-mortem examination to ascertain the exact cause of his death.
A police spokesperson said in a statement that DIG-South Syed Asad Raza took notice of the death of the suspect in the lock-up of the Darakhshan police station and ordered an inquiry.
He said that Saddar SP was appointed as the inquiry officer and he was asked to submit probe findings within 24 hours.
The DIG also suspended Darakhshan SHO Ali Raza Leghari.
The police said that the suspect was booked in a case registered under Sections 384 (Punishment for extortion) and 385 (Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) of the Pakistan Penal Code. 
The complainant informed the police that a man, identified as Moiz Naseem, contacted him over the phone and asked him to pay protection money.
He said that Junaid visited his residence on Naseem’s behalf and collected a total of Rs1.6 million on different occasions. 
He said when he refused to give more money the suspect threatened him of fire consequences. On April 14, he called Junaid to his home and informed the Darakhshan police who arrested him.

4,PTI cries foul as police stop its boat rally in Karachi’s Keamari,"Haleem Adil approaches Sindh chief secretary, IGP seeking permission for April 28 public meeting.","KARACHI: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday claimed that the police stopped it from staging a boat rally from Keamari to Manora and the district administration was also not granting it permission to hold a public meeting on April 28 in Bagh-i-Jinnah.
The PTI had announced that it would take out a boat rally on Monday. However, when a number of PTI workers, led by party’s provincial president Haleem Adil Sheikh and Karachi president Raja Azhar reached Keamari they were informed that they were not allowed to hold their planned event.
The party staged a protest in Keamari against what it called the “highhandedness of police” and accused the law enforcement agency of serving the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party.
“Our Keamari chapter workers had planned to stage a boat rally from Keamari jetty to Manora,” Mr Sheikh told reporters. “But we were stopped. We had met all legal and required formalities before staging the rally but without mentioning any reasons, the police stopped and threatened us of dire consequences. Is this democracy,” he asked.

Haleem Adil approaches Sindh chief secretary, IGP seeking permission for April 28 public meeting

He said that the PPP was “scared” of the PTI so much so that despite being in the government for more than 15 years, it didn’t feel its political stakes safe in the province because of Form-45s of the Feb 8 elections.
“The PPP has lost not only in urban areas but was almost wiped out from rural Sindh as well. The people of Sindh are now aware that the reason behind their poverty and problems is PPP,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the PTI had raised concerns over “bureaucratic delays” in obtaining the permission for holding a public meeting at Bagha-i-Jinnah near the Quaid’s mausoleum on April 28. 
In a letter addressed to the chief secretary and Sindh police chief, Mr Sheikh had referred to “unnecessary delays” in processing their application for the public gathering.
“Despite assurances from the deputy commissioner-East, there is still a delay in processing of the application,” said the letter.
“A reminder was issued on April 1 as the original public gathering date was April 21, which was approaching rapidly. Faced with continued delays, PTI-Sindh decided to reschedule the public gathering to April 28 to allow sufficient time for permissions. However, as of April 15, we have yet to receive a response, raising fears that the event may face deliberate obstacles,” Mr Sheikh added. 
Mr Sheikh emphasised that obtaining permission for the public meeting was not only a legal right but also guaranteed by the Constitution under Articles 17 and 18, which ensure freedom of association to all citizens.
Expressing frustration over the reluctance of district administration to grant the permission, the PTI appealed to the chief secretary and inspector general of police for urgent intervention.
Mr Sheikh reiterated that the purpose of the public gathering was to engage in peaceful political activities, conducted in an orderly manner without disrupting public affairs. 
He stressed the importance of addressing these concerns promptly to ensure that the PTI-Sindh could exercise its democratic rights.

6,Irfan Husain gets high five from friends on a life well lived,Late columnist remembered at launch of his book A Life Lived with Passion,"KARACHI: The book launching ceremony of late Irfan Husain’s collection of selected columns A Life Lived with Passion on Monday was quality time spent in the company of his five friends who shared glimpses of his life to help those who didn’t know him personally know him better through their eyes. 
The event was organised by the Library and Literary Sub-committee of the Karachi Gymkhana in the club’s Sapphire Hall.
Not at all a sad occasion, it was a celebration of a life with many positive dimensions, of someone who had scaled the heights of integrity and was passionate about several things which he wrote about. In fact, he wrote more than 3,000 columns and articles of which the best 140 pieces covering a diverse array of subjects were selected for the book. 
Javid Ali Khan, Irfan Husain’s close friend, who also published the book, after his passing, also praised the editors of the book — journalist Carmen Gonzalez and her husband, former Dawn editor Abbas Nasir — who meticulously selected the pieces and arranged them in chronological order. The selection helps readers witness the evolution of the author’s mind, knowledge and intellect over the span of five decades. 

Late columnist remembered at launch of his book A Life Lived with Passion

Speaking on the occasion, Javid Ali Khan said that the book is a “labour of love, a combined effort of Irfan’s wife and the editors”.
He said that he first met Irfan in a classroom where “he was the student, and I was the teacher. But later, in life he became my teacher”.
“He passed the civil service exam and was posted in Lahore first. I encouraged him to write columns. He wrote honestly and bravely,” he said, adding that he was also instrumental in introducing him to his first wife and was also best man at his second wedding to Charlotte. 
Economist and writer Dr Ishrat Husain said that he followed Irfan Husain’s columns in Dawn. “He was a truly global citizen. His columns showed his grasp over politics, history, human rights, science technology, poetry, food, and so many other things,” he said. 
“He was a conscious and sharp person, who could fit his entire message in a concise column. He had conviction. His advocacy for human rights, minorities’ rights and women’s rights showed his conviction. He wanted the government to invest in social infrastructure, education and empowerment of girls. He was critical of those who used contacts to get anywhere. He wrote about the corrupt system where relatives just got to reach important positions. He was also a firm believer in democracy. Even his earliest writings, which are some 49 to 50 years old, still have relevance,” he said. 
Former ambassador Dr Masuma Hasan, who knew Irfan Husain from their student days, said that in order to understand his journey it is necessary to look at the vibrant environment in which he was placed. “His father was a short story writer, who spoke numerous languages. His mother wrote, too. He was raised in a vibrant environment which gave him a world view,” she said. 
Eminent writer Anwar Maqsood, who was also an old friend of Irfan Husain from their Karachi University (KU) days, recalled how his friend used to get him into trouble. “I was mistaken as a thief when I was seen taking his father’s expensive ties from his closet. But it was Irfan who was selling them to me for Rs15 each,” he said, making everyone laugh. 
Though Anwar Maqsood is known as a famous humorist, it was former Senator Javed Jabbar, also Irfan Husain’s close friends from their KU days, who had the audience falling out of their chairs with laughter while sharing an old memory of them performing in a play.
The play, Julius Caesar, was not allowed to be staged at the KU so the boys, including its production designer Anwar Maqsood, took it to the Karachi Grammar School stage. 
“The characters in the play were wearing togas. Irfan was not wearing anything underneath his toga. We were directed not to fall with our feet pointing towards the audience. But Anwar Maqsood had put safety pins in all the wrong places in Irfan Husain’s costume. He was not meant to fall but he did and what was worse was that when he did his legs were pointed in the direction of the audience,” Javed Jabbar remembered. 
“When the founding father of PTV, Aslam Azhar’s wife Nasreen Azhar, who was reporting on the event, gave us a review in the paper she called it ‘The Murder of Julius Caesar’. She was being kind. It was in fact the massacre of Julius Caesar,” he finished his tale with a shudder.

7,SHC extends stay order against appointments in Sindh govt,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday once again restrained the Sindh government from making appointments in...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday once again restrained the Sindh government from making appointments in its over 140 departments, attached organisations and autonomous bodies on a lawsuit filed by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P).
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput extended its earlier stay order till May 13.
The MQM-P had contended in its lawsuit filed in August last year that the then outgoing provincial government of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), its secretaries, departments, autonomous bodies etc., had unleashed a mala fide and unlawful campaign to fill thousands of vacancies without observing formalities by way of pre-poll rigging.
It alleged that the government jobs were dished out to its favorites and blue-eyed boys.
When Justice Rajput took up for hearing the lawsuit in question along with another connected suit on Monday, the counsel for one of the defendants sought adjournment on the ground that the lead counsel was busy before another bench of the SHC.
While adjourning the hearing, the bench in its order said: “Both the matters are adjourned to 13.05.2024 to be taken up at 11:30am. Interim order, if any passed earlier in these matters, shall continue till the next date of hearing. Office is directed to place a copy of this order in connected suit.”
At a previous hearing, almost all the defendant departments and autonomous bodies had filed statements in the light of a court order and stated that all recruitment processes had been suspended, advertisements withdrawn and no appointment had been made between June and August after the SHC issued a restraining order in August 2023.
The MQM-P through its convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui had filed a suit in the SHC last year against filling thousands of vacancies allegedly without completing formalities and in violation of rules.
The lawyer for the plaintiff had asserted that those jobs were also required to be filled in accordance with Rules 14, 15 and 16 of the Sindh Civil Servant (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules 1974 and Sindh Public Commission Service Act, 2022.
However, he maintained that various departments, offices and other bodies of Sindh government had issued advertisements in July and August in a great haste with mala fide intention to complete the process of appointments illegally.
Citing the chief secretary of Sindh and around 150 others as respondents, the plaintiff stated that the entire exercise of appointments was nothing, but a mere sham, farcical and ‘the act flies in the face of common sense’ as the whole process is non-transparent and illegal since there is no written test and interview at all.
In August last year, the SHC through an interim order suspended the operation of all the advertisements, issued in July and August, impugned by the plaintiff and had restrained the authorities concerned from processing the recruitment in question till further orders. 
The MQM-P had also filed another suit last year challenging the recruitment process in the Sindh Employees Social Security Institution (SESSI), and the SHC had clubbed both matters together for a joint hearing.

8,Sindh asks Centre to increase support price of cotton,KARACHI: The Sindh government has asked the federal government to increase the support price of cotton from  ...,"KARACHI: The Sindh government has asked the federal government to increase the support price of cotton from  Rs10,000 to Rs11,000 per 40kg as the sowing of cotton in the province has declined by 20 per cent.
In a statement, Agriculture Minister Sardar Muhammad Bux Mahar urged  the federal government to address the issue of inadequate prices of the  cotton which had compelled the growers to refrain from cultivating  cotton.
He said that the current target for cotton cultivation in the province for the current year was 640,000 hectares. 
“However, the sowing of cotton in Sindh has declined by 20pc due to the increased costs of fertilizers, seeds, petroleum products, and agricultural medicines, which have escalated the expenses for farmers,” he added.
He stressed the need for enhancing the support price of cotton to incentivise farmers to cultivate more cotton.
He said that if farmers did not receive a fair price for cotton in the previous season, how they would undertake cultivation this year. 
The minister said concerns were also raised about the shortage of water allocated to Sindh at the beginning of the cropping season. “Failure to provide the province with its due share of water could result in a reduction in the cultivation of agricultural crops such as cotton and rice,” he apprehended.
He also criticised the decision of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) for providing water to the province under the three-tier formula. “By imposing decisions under the three-tier formula, IRSA is being unfair to the farmers of Sindh,” he added.
Sardar Mahar said that Irsa intended to turn agricultural lands of the province barren by denying its due share of water. “The shortage of water could result in irreparable losses during the cropping season for crops such as cotton, rice and sugarcane,” he added.

9,Woman remanded in police custody for husband’s murder,KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Monday remanded a woman in police custody in a case pertaining to the murder of ...,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Monday remanded a woman in police custody in a case pertaining to the murder of her husband.
The investigating officer of the Rizvia police station produced the suspect, Maham, before the judicial magistrate (central) sought her custody for 14 days.
During the proceedings, the IO requested the court to record her statement under Section 164 of the criminal procedure code as he suspect had already confessed to her crime.
He informed the court that the police had recovered a pistol allegedly used in the murder of her husband, Ziaullah, and had registered a separate case under the Sindh Arms Act.
However, the court remanded the suspect in police custody for two days and directed the IO to produce her on April 17.
An FIR was lodged on the complaint of Asadullah, a brother of deceased Ziaullah, who told the police that he was informed that the second wife of his brother had killed him due to “unknown reasons” near Gulbahar.
He told the police that his family had never met or seen his brother’s second wife Maham.
On the other hand, the suspect told the police that her husband subjected her to regular abuse and also did not allow her to meet with her son, who lived with her first husband in New Karachi.
On Saturday evening, she persuaded her husband to take her to New Karachi so that she could meet her son one last time. She confessed that she took Zia’s pistol before leaving home. Upon returning to their area after meeting with her son, the suspect allegedly took out the pistol and fired at her husband.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs500,000 on each convict to be paid to the legal heirs of the victim as compensation. On default, they will have to serve additional six-month imprisonment.
“The prosecution failed to establish the motive behind the incident, which creates mitigating circumstances warranting a lesser punishment for the accused,” ruled the judge.
The court declared co-accused Muzamil Hussain Shah a proclaimed offender and directed the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to block his computerised national identity card.
However, the judge acquitted another co-accused, Anas Khan, due to lack of evidence against him.

A meeting of the growers’ body chaired by its head Nawab Zubair Talpur urged Sindh government to fix support price of Rs12,000 per 40kg for cotton, otherwise the crop’s production would decline and the government would have to import the commodity to meet domestic needs, which would further suppress national economy.
The meeting condemned non-supply of water to tail-end areas and attributed it to corruption by irrigation authorities. It called for supplying water to the tail-end areas and opening non-perennial canals of Kotri barrage forthwith because they were to start providing water from April 15. 
The meeting demanded audit in agricultural engineering department for corruption and political intervention and rejected corporate farming.
It demanded provision of subsidy to farmers on electricity bills whose tariffs kept increasing and deplored corruption in Sindh Seed Corporation (SSC). The SSC should be wound up to lessen financial burden on exchequer as the corporation had failed to benefit farmers as well as agriculture sector, it said. 
The meeting condemned Sindh government’s decision to purchase wheat from traders instead of farmers and said there was no transparency in ongoing distribution of gunny bags, which should be provided to farmers to procure wheat at support price of Rs4,000 per 40kg. 
The meeting supported protest by Punjab growers for raise in wheat support price and expressed anger over corruption in Rs4bn subsidy by agriculture extension department.
It recalled the department had stomached in 2022 Rs4bn out of which Rs5,000 per acre subsidy was to be provided to flood-hit farmers for wheat cultivation as well as the subsidy for agricultural machinery, which too had fallen prey to corruption. 
The meeting called for high-profile inquiry into the massive misappropriation of public funds and rejected price of fertiliser being charged by fertiliser companies over and above actual market price. It also expressed concern over ‘artificial’ raise in the price of tractors.

He said that 1,000-strong CTD (counter-terrorism department) and RRF (Rapid Response Force) contingent had already arrived in Kashmore.
He was speaking while chairing a meeting of senior district administration and police officers in Kandhkot SSP’s Office on Monday. 
Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon, DIGs of Sukkur and Larkana police ranges and SSPs of Larkana, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Mirpurkhas and Sukkur districts were among the senior officers who attended the meeting.

Tells media 1,000-strong CTD-RFF contingent is present in Kashmore

The home minister was briefed about the law and order situation in different districts of Sindh. 
A strategy to deal with dacoit gangs and their facilitators was discussed at the meeting.
After the meeting, he told a press conference that the ongoing intelligence-based police-Rangers actions against dacoits and their facilitators in both katcha (riverine) and pucca (urban) areas of upper Sindh districts, including Kandhkot-Kashmore, would continue.
He said strict action would have to be taken against those who were found supplying sophisticated and other weapons to the gangs, operating from the riverine areas of Kandhkot. 
He pointed out that the joint police-Rangers actions were under way in the riverine areas of Kandhkot-Kashmore, Shikarpur and Ghotki districts, and said that the strategy adopted in this regard was producing desirable results.
Inter-tribe hostilities
Regarding violent incidents and bloodshed mainly resulting from inter-tribe hostilities, the minister said: “We will convene a meeting of tribal chieftains and heads of different clans and communities soon to convince them to settle down all sorts of feuds between each two of them so that peace could be ensured”. 
He pointed out that lawmakers from the upper Sindh districts had also been stressing the need for such an initiative.
“Government will take strict action against any party that will decline to enter in such a dialogue for a settlement of its hostility with its rival side,” he declared.
Heavier weapons for police
The home minster also reiterated the provincial government’s commitment to equip police with weapons and equipment matching those used by dacoit gangs so as to ensure success of the planned grand operation in the riverine areas.
Mr Lanjar informed the media that in a recent action, police had captured hideouts of dreaded Sabzoi gang in the riverine area of Kandhkot. He appreciated the police force in field for its concerted efforts towards recovery of the hostages held by dacoit gangs.
The minister offered an olive branch to defiant outlaws saying that they would be dealt with according to law [will not be harmed or killed by police] if they chose to lay down their arms and court arrest voluntarily. However, he added, they would be dealt with sternly, if they chose not to surrender.
He expressed the hope that the law and order in upper Sindh districts would improve soon as police were making great efforts in this regard. “But it will take some time to eliminate the gangs considering their number being high and the vast difficult approach to their hideouts in the riverine areas,” he said.
Some media persons posed a question to the home minister about any progress made by the JIT formed to locate a minor girl, Priya Kumari, who has been missing since Aug 2021. Mr Lanjar replied that he would seek an update from the JIT when he would proceed to Sukkur.
He was also asked about any progress in reaching the remaining suspects wanted in the murder case of senior journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar, Mr Lanjar said that the suspects were believed to have been hiding in the jungle area but they would be hunted down and put behind bars soon.

The decision to suspend the official, Irfan Bouk, was made after thorough investigation prompted by reports of non-functional reverse osmosis (RO) plants under his jurisdiction, said a press release issued on Monday.
It said that the chief secretary discovered during a surprise visit to Jamshoro district that two RO plants were inoperable due to maintenance issues. Furthermore, concerns were raised by divisional administration regarding Mr Bouk’s irregular attendance, which had significantly impacted his overall performance, it said.
It was further revealed that out of the 113 RO plants in the district, only 30 were working, which indicated major failure in ensuring local population’s access to clean drinking water, it said. 
It said that in addition, several development projects remained incomplete under Mr Bouk’s watch, exacerbating the community’s plight and depriving them of essential public health services and potable drinking water.

14,"Rampant digging plays havoc with highways, roads across Hyderabad, warns DC",HYDERABAD: Scores of road cutting permissions have been accorded to various organisations working for their...,"HYDERABAD: Scores of road cutting permissions have been accorded to various organisations working for their commercial interests ever since municipal corporations and town municipal corporations have been formed in Hyderabad. This practice is not only causing losses to the treasury, but also playing havoc with road infrastructure and creating troubles for the general public.
The Hyderabad deputy commissioner had taken up the matter with the additional chief secretary (local government) through the commissioner a little before the Eid holidays. 
The DC has written to the higher authorities that he had asked all corporations to stop the practice of issuing such permissions to save government from the losses but in vain.
He pointed out that road cutting under the permissions was continuously destroying road infrastructure, and urged the ACS to issue an order to the corporations to stop allowing the activity.
The DC has attached copies of some permissions issued by the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) and certain town municipal offices (TMOs).
The digging already carried out and still being undertaken is destroying the provincial highways, district highways and roads built by the federal government, Sindh government, local government and Public Works Department (PWD), the DC said. 
He noted that prior to the formation of municipal corporations, his office being main coordinating office of the district, used to recommend approval of road cutting after getting their physical condition checked by engineers of relevant departments. Now, he said, municipal corporations were according such permission without bothering to get the physical condition of newly-constructed roads checked. If this is allowed to go on, all newly-constructed roads will also vanish, he cautioned.
The DC also mentioned that municipal corporations were collecting road cutting charges but the money was not utilised for the reconstruction of the dug up roads. Rather, it was used for other purposes, mostly disbursement of salaries, he added. “This practice of road cutting needs to be stopped forthwith,” he stressed in his letter. 
Hyderabad Mayor Kashif Shoro, when contacted by Dawn over phone, said that a copy of the DC’s letter was not received by his office as yet. He said it should have been sent to his office. He promised to get back with his comment on the DC’s letter but he did not.
