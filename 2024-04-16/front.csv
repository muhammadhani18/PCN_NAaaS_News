0,Multiple schemes ready to attract Saudi investment,Govt to pitch Diamer-Basha dam for $1.2 billion equity-partnership,"Pakistan has decided to pitch the Diamer-Basha dam project for equity partnership with Saudi Arabia in return for $1.2 billion in investment along with a host of other schemes, as both nations are set to begin discussions for finalising the $5 billion investment package.
The Saudi authorities would be given two options for investing in the Diamer-Basha project. The first option will be the investment of $1.2 billion for a fixed period in return of fixed returns, according to officials involved in these discussions.
According to the second option, Saudi Arabia can become a partner in the project, and in this case, it will be requested to also arrange another $2.3 billion debt for the financial closure of the scheme.
The Diamer-Basha dam project is being constructed on a 30% equity and 70% debt ratio.
The Saudis will be offered to become partners in the equity and by that they are being requested to also raise the debt. The country has already begun work on the dam part of the project.
Diamer Basha Dam will have the capacity to generate around 18 billion units annually.
It will generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity with storage capacity of 6.4 million acres feet of water.
But the multibillion dollars project faces a financing gap of $3.5 billion and in case Saudi Arabia decides to take the second option, the project would achieve the financial close and can be completed by December 2029, according to the government sources.
The project will be part of about one and half dozen schemes that Pakistan would offer to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday (today) for deciding to invest $5 billion in Pakistan in the medium term, according to the government officials.
A Saudi delegation, led by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, was in Pakistan on Monday for a two-day visit. The delegation comprises Minister of Water and Agriculture Abdul Rahman Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadley, Industry and Mineral Resources Minister Bandar Ibrahim Al Khorayef, Deputy Minister of Investment Badr Al Badr, head of Saudi Special Committee Mohammad Mazyed Al Towaijri and senior officials from the Energy Ministry and the Saudi Fund for General Investments.
The visit is expected to expedite action on the understanding reached between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman, during their recent meeting aimed at enhancing bilateral economic cooperation.
The two leaders had agreed to expedite the first wave of a planned $5 billion Saudi investment package for Pakistan. The Saudi delegation will meet with the president, the prime minister and the foreign minister.
Pakistani authorities said that no final agreement was expected to be signed during the visit, which primarily aimed at finalising the projects that Saudi Arabia could pick for making the $5 billion investment.
They added that there were about half a dozen projects that were ready for the Saudi Investment, including the Diamer Basha dam and a 600MW solar power plant.
The other projects that can immediately be picked for the investment include iron ore scheme in Chiniot, construction of railways network to connect Reko Diq project with the port, two integrated tourism projects in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and some mining schemes.
Pakistan also has a desire to bring in Saudi investment in the oil refinery project but the kingdom was not inclined in this Greenfield project. The sources said that the Pak-Arab Refinery Company (Parco) also had some issues with the scheme. But there is still a possibility for Saudi investment in the Pakistan refinery project, they added.
Pakistan has been struggling to raise money from international institutions amid Indian opposition to the project. Pakistan had also offered the Diamer Basha project to China under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework but the deal could not be finalised.
Ground-breaking of the Diamer-Basha dam has been performed many times in the past 20 years. Neither the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) nor China would finance the dam, therefore, the government decided to construct the reservoir from its resources.
Multilateral donors had refused to give financing for this project due to lobbying by India that the project falls in a disputed area.
The Pakistani authorities are pinning high hopes on the large Saudi delegation visit. This visit is also crucial to bring the first investment under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) shortly.
For the Pakistani authorities, the milestone visit is the climax of the many visits done by both sides to complete the groundwork.
During the visit, concrete projects will be discussed and finalised under the SIFC ambit, according to the SIFC Secretariat. This visit will be followed by another visit of the Assistant Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia and a high-powered delegation that will arrive on Tuesday to finalise the projects related to defence production and defence cooperation.

1,Army sees Afghanistan-based terrorists acting as proxies against CPEC,Army chief chairs Corps Commanders’ Conference; directs brass to pro-actively deny space to terrorists,"The military said on Tuesday that terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan were acting as proxies against Pakistan and its economic interests, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), posing a threat to regional and global security.
Chairing the 264th Corps Commanders’ Conference at the General Headquarters, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir directed the top military commanders to pro-actively deny any space to the terrorists, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a news release.
According to the ISPR, Gen Asim praised the untiring efforts of the army and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in successfully thwarting several terrorist attacks and neutralising key terrorist commanders during the ongoing counterterrorism operations.
The news release stated that the forum took serious notice of the baseless propaganda against the LEAs and the security forces, and resolved to launch strict legal action against the perpetrators.
“The forum noted with concern the malicious propaganda campaign meant to demoralise the armed forces and underscored that unfounded and baseless allegations on law-enforcement agencies and security forces have become a fashion,” the news release said.
These allegations, it continued, were part of a larger design to drive a wedge between the people and the armed forces of Pakistan. “We will not allow such efforts to succeed and as per the law and Constitution, stern action will be ensured,” the media wing of the military stated.
The forum paid rich tributes to the supreme sacrifices of the Shuhada, including officers and men of the armed forces, LEAs and the citizens, who laid their lives for peace and stability in the country,” according to the ISPR news release.
“The COAS appreciated the untiring efforts of the Pakistan Army and the LEAs in successfully thwarting several terrorist attacks and neutralising key terrorist commanders during the ongoing counterterrorism operations,” it said.
“The army chief directed the commanders to pro-actively deny any space to the terrorists. He said: ‘The Armed Forces and LEAs of Pakistan, fully backed by the resilient nation, remain determined to permanently eliminate this menace from Pakistan, INSHA’ALLAH’,” it added.
The ISPR said that the forum received a briefing on how terrorist groups, operating from Afghanistan, posed a threat to regional and global security, besides acting as proxies against Pakistan and its economic interests, especially CPEC.
The Corps Commanders’ Conference condemned the heinous terrorist attack against Chinese nationals in Bisham as well as the killing of innocent civilians in Balochistan, the news release stated.
The forum expressed serious concern over the ongoing Indian aggression in the Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), and reaffirmed that Pakistan would continue to provide political, diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri brothers and sisters.
It expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and condemned serious human rights violations, war crimes and genocide being perpetrated in Gaza. The forum also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East and noted that a wider regional conflict could ensue if both sides did not de-escalate immediately.

The forum resolved to provide full support to the government towards achieving sustainable socioeconomic growth in the country, including wholehearted assistance in countering the illegal spectrum, particularly smuggling, hoarding, electricity theft and safe repatriation of all illegal foreigners.
“The COAS directed the field commanders to ensure the highest standards of operational preparedness and motivation within their outfits and to pursue professional excellence through objective training,” the news release concluded.

2,Saudi FM’s visit foreshadows ‘significant benefits’,Prince Faisal says Pakistan has ‘untapped potential’ in many areas which needs to be tapped,"The visit by a high-powered Saudi delegation would pave the way for “significant benefits” for both countries in the upcoming months, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said, following a wide-ranging engagement in Islamabad on Tuesday.
Speaking at a joint news conference with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, the visiting foreign minister said that he was “impressed” with the new initiative and arrangements being put in place by authorities in Pakistan to attract investment.
Prince Faisal led the high-powered delegation that included the core team of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to explore potential opportunities for investment in Pakistan under the banner of Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).
The visit was the follow up of recent trip by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Saudi Arabia where he sought Saudi leadership’s help in reviving the country’s economy through investment. The crown prince instructed his key ministers to travel to Pakistan to explore opportunities of investment.
Against this backdrop, the Saudi delegation had a wide-ranging engagement in Pakistan. The Saudi delegation held separate meetings with President Asif Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz, and Foreign Minister Dar and was given detailed presentation on the investment opportunities at the SIFC.
At a joint news conference at the Foreign Office, Prince Faisal said that the Saudi delegation travelled to Islamabad on the instructions of the crown prince. He termed his engagements “productive” and spoke about the depth of strategic and economic relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
“We are extremely impressed by the very proactive attitude that we saw in our meetings, especially with the Investment Council and a very strong business-focused approach on addressing challenges and opportunities and highlighting the work we can do together,” Prince Faisal said.
“I feel very confident that the results of this visit and the results of the work being done between the two respective teams with this attitude, with this approach of focus on results overcoming hurdles will deliver significant benefits for both of our countries, will significantly accelerate the process of achieving those investments that we’re looking at together,” he added.
“I can say that there is significant opportunity to increase the level of investment that is already on the table,” the Saudi foreign minister told reporters, adding that the visiting delegation had laid the ground for work to be done in the coming months.
There were no agreements or memoranda of understanding (MoUs) signed during the visit, as officials said that the tangible outcome of ongoing engagements would be announced during an expected visit of Crown Prince Mohammad at some time this year.
Pakistan is hoping that Saudi Arabia would pump billions of dollars in investment, something that would help the country address its chronic economic problems. Certain areas have already been identified for Saudi investors such as energy, agriculture, mines and minerals and even the hydro-power projects.
The Saudi foreign minister admitted that Pakistan had an “untapped potential” in many areas that needed to be tapped. “Working together, we will do what we can with our colleagues in the government of Pakistan to make that happen,” he said.
On the occasion, Foreign Minister Dar told reporters that he had never seen such a high-powered Saudi delegation to have visited Pakistan in the last 35 years. This, he added, highlighted the importance Saudi Arabia attached to its ties with Pakistan.
He lauded the Saudi leadership for swiftly responding to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s request for sending a high-powered delegation. Dar said the Saudi delegation was given the first-hand account of the SIFC and how the initiative was meant to fast-track investment in Pakistan.
Both the foreign ministers also spoke about the current crisis in the Middle East. Prince Faisal conceded that the international community failed to bring peace to the region. He castigated the international community for their double standards.
Prince Faisal said the aid started flowing to Gaza only after six foreign aid workers were killed by the Israelis. “We are now well beyond 33,000 civilians killed. We are now actively discussing the potential for famine In Gaza,” he stated.
The Saudi foreign minister warned that Gaza people were starving to death because the humanitarian assistance was not reaching them. “It is a complete failure of the international system and systems of international law and government to live up to their responsibilities.” he lamented.
“There is no justification for the restriction of humanitarian aid in entering Gaza,” the top Saudi diplomat said. Dar endorsed his Saudi counterpart’s stance and stressed that there must be an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza.
The foreign minister said that the world’s consciousness must wake up. “We believe the perpetual solution to this issue will be when a Palestinian state is established according to the 1964 resolution,” he stressed.
Earlier, the Saudi delegation attended the ‘Saudi Arabia-Pakistan Investment Conference’ at the SIFC, the Foreign Office said. On the occasion, Dar warmly welcomed the Saudi delegation, emphasising the deep-rooted bilateral ties and mutual strategic interests.
He highlighted the significance of enhanced bilateral strategic and economic partnership and the crucial role of Saudi investments in nurturing this relationship. He explained how Pakistan through the SIFC platform aimed to streamline investment processes and ensure a rapid decision-making.
The foreign minister highlighted abundant opportunities in Pakistan’s agriculture, information technology (IT), and mining sectors, and invited Saudi investors to engage in the mutually-beneficial partnerships. He called for constructive engagement for mutual prosperity and development.
The SIFC officials gave comprehensive briefings to the participants, encompassing the potential and investment opportunities in key sectors of Pakistan’s economy. Both sides held exhaustive deliberative sessions at the functional level to crystallise investment opportunities in Pakistan.
The Saudi side expressed great interest in improving investment ecosystem in Pakistan, appreciated SIFC’s role in amicable resolution of the Saudi legacy investment and business-related issues, and showed keen interest in investing in key sectors of Pakistan.
The Pakistan side assured the Saudi side of maximum support and facilitation in fast-tracking the kingdom’s prospective multibillion dollars investments in Pakistan.
The two sides also finalised a bilateral implementation mechanism to closely coordinate and execute investment-related matters at the functional level to turn the sovereign commitments into tangible economic outcomes.
The Saudi delegation also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz where both sides agreed to work closely to expedite the first phase of Saudi investments in Pakistan under the new arrangement, a statement issued by the Prime Minister Office said.
During the meeting, Prime Minister Shehbaz expressed his deep appreciation for the leadership of the Saudi Arabia and conveyed his sincerest wishes to King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
“The prime minister underscored the significance accorded by Pakistan to its longstanding fraternal, economic and strategic relations with Saudi Arabia. He said both countries had always stood together at all times,” the statement said.
He also recalled his “warm and productive” meeting with the crown prince earlier this month, saying that the visit of the Saudi delegation was a “manifestation of the strong commitment of both countries to the strengthening of bilateral relations focused on mutually beneficial economic cooperation”.
“In this regard, the prime minister stated that both sides needed to work closely to expedite the first phase of Saudi investments in Pakistan under the new arrangement,” the statement said. Shehbaz also informed the Saudi delegation about the SIFC and its initiatives to promote investment in Pakistan.
“He also highlighted the key role of Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir and the cooperation of all institutions for the promotion of investment in the country through SIFC,” the statement said.

3,CJP’s extension issue stirs political chessboard,PTI vows to resist attempts to extend CJP’s tenure,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) while giving credence to the speculation that the government was allegedly planning to extend the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) tenure for three years vowed on Monday that it would thwart any move deviating from the set pattern of judges’ promotion to unduly facilitate CJP Justice Qazi Faez Isa.
Currently, the issue stands somewhere between speculations and assumptions as the ministers have previously denied any progress in this regard yet the PTI claims that the government was busy making such a move, saying “the fake government” was seemingly planning to extend his tenure for three more years.
Amid rigging allegations and protests from the opposition parties, some legal experts while questioning the alleged lack of legitimacy of the current government in making a constitutional amendment opposed the idea, saying any such move would look clearly like machination and the judiciary should stay away from it.
Although the speculations about CJP’s extension have been making the rounds for a few weeks in the capital, PTI spokesperson clearly brought the issue into the public domain when its central information secretary, Raoof Hasan, held a press conference and made it clear that the party would strongly resist any such move.
In the press conference, the PTI spokesperson made it clear that PTI would strongly resist any act in violation of the set pattern of judges’ promotion to “unduly facilitate Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Isa,"" saying the current government was hell-bent on destroying state institutions.
Surprisingly, Hasan also relied on speculation as he said that reports were surfing that the “fake government” was planning to table a bill seeking an extension in the tenure of the incumbent CJP, which, he said, “PTI would not allow to change the set rule come what may”.
In an official statement, Raoof alleged that “Qazi Faiz Isa was playing the role of a facilitator to the government and powerful circles,"" adding the CJP could only see the dereliction of justice being done 40 years ago but did not see the injustices and fascism facing the PTI and the constitutional violation in the country.
“Hence,” he said, “legislation would likely be done to make him chief justice for a fixed tenure.” He vowed that the government was infringing the constitution and that the PTI would leave no stone unturned to protect the constitution and supremacy of law.
“To attempt any change to the constitution in such circumstances would look clearly like machination,” a lawyer and political analyst, Abdul Moiz Jaferii, said. “It’s like someone whose claim to a house is disputed suddenly decides to add another floor and knock out a few walls.”
Jaferii, however, said that the actual problem will be the lack of legitimacy of this current government in making a constitutional amendment, saying it would only have the numbers due to wrongly allotted reserved seats, stemming directly from the loss of the bat symbol and which are currently disputed. He said that the numbers would also come from seats which are under dispute before election tribunals.
Former vice president of Lahore High Court Bar Association, Rabbiya Bajwa, shared with The Express Tribune that any move to extend CJP’s tenure was not acceptable and would be resisted as there was no room for it in the constitution.
The lawyer, who belongs to the professional group of lawyers, recalled that lawyers had resisted moves about judges’ tenure in the past and had forced the governments, including that of Gen Musharraf’s period, to withdraw the same.
“If [CJP] Justice Faez Isa accepts any such offer then we would think that it was initiated on his behalf,” Bajwa said, saying CJP’s role regarding human rights and political victimization wasn’t very good as he didn’t play the role which was expected from him. “To some extent, it seems that he [CJP] is an ally of powers backed by the establishment,” Bajwa alleged.
Bajwa, however, regretted that the talk about extensions wasn’t a new phenomenon for Pakistan as the whole system was put at stake by the bigwigs of the establishment for getting extensions in the past.
“Judiciary should stay away from any such move,” she said, saying the move would worsen the already difficult situation and lead to weakening the country. She emphasized that all institutions should work within the defined constitutional boundaries.
The information minister was texted to get his response but no reply came till the filing of the story.
