0,Drug abuse among women witnesses alarming surge,Lack of data on addiction hampers efforts to address issue effectively,"The prevalence of drug usage, notably smoking, is on the rise among women in Pakistan, posing a significant concern for public health.
While statistics from a survey conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in 2012-2013 indicated that around seven million people engaged in substance consumption, recent figures suggest a notable increase.
Data on drug addiction among young girls and women remains scarce, largely due to social stigmas associated with seeking treatment.
Dr Shamila Batool, a psychologist at a rehabilitation centre in Lahore, highlighted the reluctance of parents to admit their daughters to such facilities due to societal shame, hindering efforts to collect comprehensive data.
""Parents often prefer to deal with the issue privately, fearing judgment from society,"" she remarked.
""This reluctance only perpetuates the cycle of addiction, as individuals struggle to break free from the grip of drugs without professional help.""
Zunaira, a young woman undergoing treatment, shared her harrowing journey into addiction, spurred by societal pressures and personal disappointments. Her story underscores the devastating consequences of substance abuse, culminating in a tragic event that prompted her to seek help.
""I never imagined I would find myself in this situation,"" she confessed. ""But the constant pressure to meet societal expectations, coupled with my own insecurities, pushed me towards substance abuse as a coping mechanism.""
Maham, another resident of Lahore, shed light on the prevalent drug culture in her social circle, where substances like alcohol, hashish, and cocaine are normalised.
Despite societal pressures, she abstains from drug use and advocates for vigilant monitoring and support among peers. ""It's disheartening to see how easily accessible drugs have become, especially among young adults,"" she lamented. ""But we must prioritize our health and well-being over societal expectations.""
Clinical psychologist Jahan Ara Rana stressed the importance of recognizing behavioural changes indicative of addiction and seeking timely intervention.
She emphasised the need for treating addiction as a medical condition, urging continuous monitoring even post-recovery.
""Addiction is a complex issue that requires comprehensive treatment and ongoing support,"" she explained. ""By addressing underlying psychological issues and providing necessary resources, we can help individuals overcome their dependence on drugs.""
Syed Zulfiqar Hussain, Director of the Drug Advisory Training Hub, revealed alarming statistics reflecting a surge in drug addiction, particularly among the youth.
He attributed this trend to the easy accessibility of drugs and lauded government initiatives like the ""Drug-Free Punjab Campaign"" aimed at curbing drug trafficking. ""The rampant availability of drugs poses a grave threat to our society,"" he warned. ""It's imperative that we take proactive measures to address this issue and protect our youth from falling prey to addiction.""
Punjab Police intensified efforts to combat drug trafficking, resulting in numerous arrests and seizures of illicit substances.
IG Punjab Usman Anwar reiterated the commitment to holding drug offenders accountable, safeguarding the future of the nation's youth.
""We will not tolerate those who jeopardize the well-being of our citizens,"" he declared. ""Through collaborative efforts and stringent enforcement measures, we will strive to create a safer and drug-free environment for all.""

1,Five Nigerian nationals held over narcotics peddling,OCU Kishwar disclosed recovery of drugs worth millions of rupees,"Five Nigerian nationals, part of an international drug peddling network operating in Pakistan using postal and online taxi services, have been apprehended.
DIG Organised Crime Unit (OCU) Imran Kishwar disclosed this during a press briefing at his office, revealing the recovery of drugs worth millions of rupees.

For instance, they would mix cocaine with brown sugar and a chemical to intensify the drug's effects, posing severe health risks to users. Additionally, the suspects utilised fake identities on social media platforms for their illicit activities.
The OCU teams faced significant challenges in dismantling these networks due to the elaborate chain of operations and the use of false identities.
Imran highlighted the complexity of the investigations, mentioning the detention of over 18 riders and the analysis of numerous CCTV footages.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Punjab Police reported over 14,000 raids on drug dealers' hideouts across various districts, resulting in the seizure of substantial quantities of narcotics.

He stressed the importance of delivering strict punishments to offenders through the judicial system.

The Punjab government has reduced the price of a 100-gram of Roti from Rs20 to Rs16 and a 120-gram Naan from Rs30 to Rs20 across the province after the prices of wheat and flour decreased.
Tandoor operators complained that the provincial government had not taken them into confidence before issuing the notification of the new prices and implementing it.

He said the electricity and gas costs had increased manifold along with the wages of employees and rent of shops.

He said that 250 Rotis were cooked from a 20kg flour bag, which were sold for Rs5,000. The price of a bag of flour is Rs2,700. The gas, electricity and water bills are paid from the remaining amount. The daily wage of a labourer for preparing dough and cooking is Rs2,000. A tandoor employee, Nabil Ahmed, said the income from the business was low.
Lahore Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa said the food department and district administration had reviewed all aspects related to the matter.
He said Roti was being sold for Rs15 and Naan at Rs20 in Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib. The price of Roti in Lahore and Kasur was Rs16.

7,Police to add 20 new checkpoints amid Kacha dacoit resurgence,Decision came following a high-level meeting chaired by Punjab IGP Dr Usman Anwar,"In response to the resurgence of Kacha dacoits, Punjab Police has decided to establish 20 new checkpoints in Rajanpur and Rahim Yar Khan riverine areas, aiming to bolster security measures.
The decision came following a high-level meeting chaired by Punjab IGP Dr Usman Anwar.
Attended by Additional IG South Punjab Kamran Khan, RPO DG Khan Captain (retd) Sajjad Hasan Khan and other officials, the meeting focused on reinforcing the police presence in border districts with advanced logistics and equipment.
The deployment includes new APCs, thermal cameras, night vision goggles, binoculars, and quadcopters to combat criminal activities.
Addressing the gathering, IG Punjab Dr. Usman Anwar emphasized the need to enhance operational efficiency and intelligence-based operations against gangs and criminals in kacha and border areas.
The meeting also reviewed strategies to prevent smuggling and hoarding in inter-provincial border areas.
Highlighting the significance of utilising quadcopters to access secret shelters of criminals, Dr Usman Anwar stressed the importance of continuous intelligence-based operations to eliminate active criminal elements.
While Punjab and Sindh Police collaborated in a crackdown on Kacha areas last year, recent weeks have witnessed a surge in crimes and kidnapping incidents, prompting intensified action by both provincial forces. However, critics raise concerns over the timing of police operations during the wheat crop harvesting season, alleging that they often serve vested interests rather than upholding law and order.
The fertile land in kacha, spread over thousands of acres, presents opportunities for exploitation by influential individuals.
With proper land demarcation lacking, powerful entities often leverage muscle power to stake claims, leading to disputes and challenges for law enforcement agencies.
