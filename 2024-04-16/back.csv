0,"Oil tanker association halts fuel supply to twin cities, northern areas","Deliveries to all depots are continuing without disruption, says chairman All Pakistan Oil Tanker Association","The Rawalpindi Oil Tanker Association ceased on Tuesday the supply of fuel to the twin cities and upper parts of the country.
The association ceased supply to Islamabad, Peshawar, Gilgit, Skardu, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Azad Kashmir regions, claiming that their demands have not been met and supply will not resume till the authorities follow the agreement reached on February 20.
The issue was reportedly brought to the attention of OGRA and the Ministry of Petroleum on several occasions.
“The tanker owners and consumers are defrauded due to inadequate supply of petrol and diesel which is inflicting severe loss to them,” the protestors said.
However, Chairman of the All Pakistan Oil Tanker Association Mir Shams Shahwani said that the ""deliveries to all depots are continuing without disruption”.
Shahwani also advocated for action against the ""striking mafias"" and denounced their actions to exploit the situation for personal gain. Furthermore, he urged the registration of cases against them.
Earlier in 2023, the prolonged strikes brought forth challenges in oil supply. The oil companies mentioned scarcity, pressing for government intervention to avoid the crisis.
“Due to the strike by oil transporters across the country, there is a problem in the supply of petroleum products,” an OCAC letter to the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum Division stated.
This month marked the second hike in petrol prices. The prices are raised by up to Rs 8.14 per litre due to global oil price fluctuations. The petrol prices jumped by Rs4.53 per litre while diesel increased by 8.14 per litre. The prompt consideration by the IMF may potentially lead to further hikes in the future.

PM Shehbaz emphasized the crucial contribution of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS ) General Syed Asim Munir and institutional cooperation in promoting investment through SIFC.
The delegation, comprising key ministers and senior officials arrived in Pakistan on the heels of a visit by PM Shehbaz to Riyadh earlier this month where he held wide-ranging talks with the Saudi leadership.

2,"FBI opens criminal probe in Baltimore bridge collapse, fourth body recovered",Agents boarded the cargo ship Dali to conduct court-authorized law enforcement activity regarding the crash,"The FBI said on Monday it opened a criminal probe into the collapse of a Baltimore bridge in March when a ship crashed into a bridge support, while local officials confirmed the recovery of a fourth body from the incident.
FBI agents boarded the cargo ship Dali to conduct court-authorized law enforcement activity regarding the crash, an FBI spokesperson said. The spokesperson said there was no other public information available and the bureau would have no further comment.
The body of a fourth victim was recovered on Monday after divers spotted what they believed to be a missing construction vehicle, inside which they found the body, the Key Bridge Unified Command said in a statement. Details surrounding the victim's identity were not made public at the request of the family.
The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed into the Patapsco River in the early morning of March 26, killing six men who were working on the span at the time, after the massive container ship lost power and crashed into a support pylon. The bodies of two victims are still missing.
The investigation into the collapse will focus in part on whether the crew of the Dali left the port knowing the freighter had serious problems with its systems, the Washington Post reported earlier.
Safety investigators have recovered the ship's ""black box"" recorder, which provides data on its position, speed, heading, radar, and bridge audio and radio communications, as well as alarms.
The city of Baltimore said on Monday it hired two law firms - DiCello Levitt and Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky Trial Lawyers - as it considered litigation against the owner, charterer and operator of the ship.
The registered owner of the Singapore-flagged ship is Grace Ocean Pte Ltd. Synergy Marine Group managed the ship and Maersk chartered the vessel.
The head of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board separately told Congress last week that its investigators had interviewed key cargo ship personnel as part of its probe.
Work to clear the wreckage and restore traffic through the Baltimore port's shipping channel continues.
Replacing the bridge will likely take years, but authorities have opened two temporary channels to allow some shallow-draft vessels to move around the stricken container vessel. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said two weeks ago that it expected to open a new channel to the Port of Baltimore by the end of April.
When the crash occurred, the Dali was leaving Baltimore en route to Colombo, Sri Lanka, with a crew of 21, plus two pilots on board to guide it out of the port.
The same ship was involved in an incident in the port of Antwerp, Belgium, in 2016, when it hit a quay as it tried to exit a North Sea container terminal.
An inspection in June 2023 carried out in San Antonio, Chile, found the vessel had propulsion and auxiliary machinery deficiencies, according to data on the public Equasis website, which provides information on ships.
According to Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority, the vessel passed foreign port inspections last June and September.

3,Members call for holding JCP meeting,Urge CJ to ensure merit and seniority in the elevation of judges,"There is a proposal to immediately convene a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to approve the draft rules for the elevation of judges to the superior judiciary.
This proposal has been made by the JCP member from the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), Akhtar Hussain, and former JCP member Advocate Amjad Farooq Khattak. Three judges are to be appointed to the Supreme Court.
In February this year, the Supreme Court’s senior judge Ijazul Ahsan suddenly resigned. Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi followed suit and handed in his resignation in view of misconduct proceedings initiated against him by the Supreme Judicial Council. SC senior Puisne judge Sardar Tariq Masood also retired last month.
Akhtar Hussain told The Express Tribune that one SC judge should be appointed from the Sindh High Court, and at least one judge from the Lahore High Court should be elevated to the SC. He said Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faez Isa also holds the opinion that chief justices should not have the sole authority to nominate judges.
“The draft prepared by the Rules Making Committee has been finalized; now, a full JCP meeting should be called to approve it,” he said. Amjad Farooq Khattak said appointments of judges in the higher judiciary should be based on merit rather than relationships and affiliations with chambers.
“We hope for Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faez Isa's support. Instead of politics and favors, judicial appointments should adhere to the seniority principle,” he added.
He said judges can also be appointed from among lawyers because there is no restriction in the Constitution regarding this matter.
He further stated that currently, there are six vacant positions for judges in the Peshawar High Court, as well as vacancies in the Lahore High Court and the Sindh High Court. “A full JCP meeting should be requested to approve the rules,” he said.
At the JCP meeting on December 4, the CJ formed the committee to define the protocols for appointing judges to the superior judiciary. According to a news report published in The Express Tribune, the committee was expected to submit its recommendations to CJP Isa by January 15.
The PBC has persistently advocated for alterations in the JCP rules, proposing that the sole authority to select judges should not rest with the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
However, at the December 4 meeting, two JCP members, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, and Justice Munib Akhtar, had expressed objections to the committee's formation at this juncture, especially in the absence of an elected government.
PBC member Advocate Akhtar Hussain highlighted that judge appointments, being a policy matter, have nevertheless been executed. Stressing the urgency of filling vacant positions in high courts, Hussain had urged the expeditious framing of judge nomination regulations.

4,Balochistan declares emergency as western winds loom,"NDMA sounds the alarm, issues alerts to all concerned authorities","As the nation braces for a new wave of western winds beginning Tuesday, the Balochistan government has declared a rain and urban flood emergency. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) remains on high alert for the impending thunderstorms expected to hit various regions.
The provincial government's declaration of emergency comes in response to ongoing heavy rains that have pounded different districts of the province, resulting in casualties and injuries. Shahid Rind, spokesperson for the Balochistan government, highlighted the necessity of this declaration.
To ensure swift rescue operations for flood-affected individuals and preempt any potential crises, all leaves for government officers and staff members have been cancelled.
In addition, Shahid Rind declared the closure of schools in rain-affected districts of the province on April 15 and 16.
Under the leadership of Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, an online meeting convened with commissioners and PDMA officials to assess the situation arising from heavy rainfall in the province and to discuss the ongoing rescue efforts.
During the meeting, the chief minister expressed dissatisfaction with public grievances regarding inadequate drainage systems and pledged to allocate necessary resources and support to field officers for timely and precautionary actions in rain-affected areas.
Bugti stressed the government's obligation to alleviate the suffering of affected individuals, instructing field officers to clear encroachments on drainage canals and urging them, along with district
administration officials, to visit affected areas and extend all possible assistance to those in need.
Flood, landslides alert
Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority also issued an alert.
With the imminent threat of flooding and landslides looming large, the disaster management authority has sounded the alarm, issuing alerts to all concerned authorities.
From April 16 to 22, under the influence of these powerful winds, widespread rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and hail is anticipated to pummel different parts of the country.
The forecast comes as at least 41 people have died in storm-related incidents across Pakistan since Friday, including 28 killed by lightning, officials said on Monday.
Punjab witnessed the highest death toll, with 21 people killed by lightning between Friday and Sunday.
People living in open, rural areas are more at risk of being struck by lightning during thunderstorms.
In particular, mountainous areas face the peril of snowfall, raising concerns about potential landslides and river flooding in Balochistan. The NDMA has called upon all relevant institutions to remain vigilant in anticipation of potential flood emergencies.
Additionally, the prime minister expressed concerns about the heavy rains affecting parts of the country and expressed condolences for the lives lost.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told the participants that he had asked the chairman of the NDMA to coordinate with the provinces and provincial disaster management authorities to dispatch relief items to the affected areas.
According to meteorological experts, a fresh wave of western winds is set to sweep into Balochistan Tuesday night, gradually enveloping most districts of the province by April 17.
By April 18, these weather patterns are projected to extend to the northern regions, triggering rainfall across Azad Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit Baltistan.
The NDMA has issued directives to concerned departments to stay on high alert. A spokesperson for the NDMA highlighted the heightened risk of flooding in key river systems including the Kabul River, Swat, and Panjkora.
Communities residing along the banks of these rivers, particularly in areas such as Yake Ghund, Nowshera, and Peshawar along the Kabul River, are urged to exercise caution.
Similarly, inhabitants of Utmankhel, Dir, and other locales adjacent to the Panjkora River are advised to prepare for potential flooding.
Moreover, low-lying areas such as Charbagh, Bahrain, and Babuzai in the Swat Valley are on high alert for flooding, while concerns persist regarding the threat of landslides in both lowland and hilly regions.
In addition to the deluge, the onslaught of wind and hail poses a grave threat to standing crops, infrastructure, and public safety.
Authorities have cautioned against unnecessary travel to high-risk areas and advise citizens to steer clear of power poles, unstable buildings, and waterways during inclement weather.
Army rescue operations
Meanwhile, the army continued conducting rescue operations in rain-affected regions of Swat, Dir, and Chitral.
According to reports, the Pakistan Army, in collaboration with district administration and other rescue agencies, has managed to reopen several roads in these areas, restoring traffic flow.
The closure of the Chitral to Peshawar Road resulted from landslides, prompting swift intervention from the Pakistan Army. Utilising heavy machinery, the army swiftly cleared the roadblocks, facilitating the resumption of normal traffic.
Simultaneously, alongside rescue endeavours, the Pakistan Army extends aid to stranded tourists, ensuring their safety and providing assistance during this challenging period.
In a separate development, the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) has successfully rescued tourist families who were trapped near Khunjerab Pass following an avalanche that blocked the road for all traffic yesterday.
The avalanche, spanning 150 meters, had ensnared over 60 vehicles and trapped more than 180 tourist families.
The FWO deployed heavy machinery to clear the avalanche, while medical teams from the Pakistan Army promptly assisted the stranded tourists, who were at risk of serious health complications due to the extreme cold weather.

5,Opp welcomes int’l investors delegation,PTI again urges independent probe into May 9 riots,"Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, expressed the opposition's warm welcome to an international investors’ delegation from a friendly nation.
He emphasized the importance of ensuring equitable distribution of dividends from such investments to benefit the local populace. Standing alongside MNAs Mahmood Khan Achakzai of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Khan reiterated the opposition's stance on prioritizing the welfare of local communities in regions where investment projects are implemented.
He maintained that any delegation from brotherly nations intended to support the economic uplift of the country was warmly welcomed by the opposition.
The opposition, he added, had the only demand that the government should ensure equal and just distribution of the dividends of those investments to the local populace of the particular region where the projects were implemented.
“Be it Balochistan or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or any other province the first beneficiaries of foreign investment are the local people.”
Highlighting the significance of upholding the Constitution and the rule of law, Mahmood Achakzai extended an invitation to any political party that shares these principles to join the opposition alliance.
Barrister Gohar Ali emphasized the non-negotiable nature of the rule of law, emphasizing that it serves as the foundation for a thriving democracy. He affirmed his party's commitment to continuing the struggle for this cause.
Meanwhile, the PTI has reiterated its call for independent investigations into the May 9 and Bahawalnagar incidents while expressing strong discontent with the delay in hearing appeals filed by former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, against their conviction in various cases.
Following Monday's hearing of the iddat case involving Imran and Bushra, PTI Secretary of Information Raoof Hassan asserted that the government, acting under powerful influences, is attempting to manipulate the Constitution.
He cited plans to allow a fixed term of three years for Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and pledged the PTI's parliamentary efforts to prevent such a move. Referring to the Bahawalnagar incident, Hassan lamented the escalation of conflict between two state institutions.
He questioned who would address the grievances of the PTI members affected by the May 9 incident, emphasizing the need to end these tactics that weaken the country.
Critiquing the Foreign Office's statement on the Iran-Israel conflict, Hassan lambasted the government's perceived reluctance to mention Israel by name.
He also expressed frustration over what he described as deliberate tactics to prolong court proceedings involving Imran and Bushra. He underscored the adverse effects of such delays on the state and the judicial system, stating, ""There is no end to the decline when the state suffers.""
Naeem Haider Panjhota, a member of PTI's legal team, echoed concerns over the use of delaying tactics. He stressed the necessity of a fair and expeditious trial, highlighting the personal toll on individuals like Bushra Bibi, who missed celebrating Eid at home due to the delays.
Panjhota questioned Khawar Maneka’s lawyer Rizwan Abbasi’s behavior during the iddat case proceedings and his sudden departure from the court at a crucial moment.
He alleged that Abbasi, known for extensive arguments during previous trials, was now attempting to delay the case under the pretext of being unprepared.
Panjhota pointed out that Imran Khan was sentenced in three cases within five days and questioned when justice would be served, as Abbasi succeeded in postponing the hearing once more.
He alleged that the court appeared to be under pressure yet again. He also highlighted the unresolved issue of Bushra Bibi's endoscopy and Imran Khan's medical examination, with several pending applications in court for their medical check-ups.

6,"POL products import, re-export allowed",POL products import via foreign suppliers accounts allowed,"The federal government on Monday allowed the import of petroleum products, sale in the local market and their re-export to other countries through the foreign suppliers account, according to the newly-notified Customs Bonded Facilitation Rules (CBFR), 2024.
According to the documents available to The Express Tribune, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has amended the Customs Rules, 2001 to include the CBFR. The new rules stated that foreign suppliers can either set up their own business in Pakistan or operate through a subsidiary of a registered company.
The rules further stated that international oil suppliers can store crude oil or other petroleum products in customs bonded warehouses in Pakistan, adding that there would also be permission to keep inventory of crude oil and other petroleum products for local buyer or re-export without farm exchange.
The rules further stated that international oil suppliers could operate through a subsidiary of a company registered in Pakistan, provided that this subsidiary was registered with FBR and had a bank account in Pakistan.

7,Zaeem Qadri intends to join Abbasi’s party,Former PML-N Punjab minister vows to stand with ex-PM,"Zaeem Hussain Qadri, a former Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader has expressed his resolve to join a new political party, which will be launched by former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in the coming weeks.
Abbasi formally moved the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for the registration the party under the Election Act earlier this week. Though, the name of the new party has not yet been released, some unconfirmed reports suggest it could be ‘Reform Party’.
A day after, Abbasi went to the ECP in Islamabad, Qadri, who served as the Punjab minister in then chief minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, expressed his resolve to stand with Abbasi and would become a member of his party upon its launch.
Qadri, once seen as a hawk in the PML-N until 2017, has been laying low after parting ways with party in 2018 over a dispute over allotment of tickets and other issues with the party President Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza.
However, despite publicly criticising Shehbaz and Hamza, Qadri’s wife, Uzma, remained a member of the Punjab Assembly on the reserved seats for women and eventually become an MPA in 2018. She was denied the party ticket in 2024 elections.
Talking to The Express Tribune Syeda Uzma Qadri said that Zaeem Qadri had indeed decided to join Abbasi. When asked if any formal meeting was held with Abbasi or his core team, she confirmed that meetings were going on for quite time some now.
She said that the new party would be launched before Eidul Azha. “Hopefully much before that”, she said, and added that Qadri had waited for five long years for a good opportunity to re-emerge on the political scene.
She revealed that Qadri was approached by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) as well as the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for the elections, but he had “respectfully declined” the offers. “Joining a party means agreeing to its ideology.”
She said that Abbasi was a seasoned politician and those with him, including Miftah Ismail, had served the country to the best of their abilities. “So, once they get the chance to govern the country, they will steer the country out of the crises it is in.”
According to the back ground discussions, the new party will approach the masses with the pitch that the three main political parties had failed to bring about any meaningful change in the country which necessitates the launching of a new party.
Another PML-N leader and former Sindh governor Muhammad Zubair too seems a potentially suitable name for this new party, though he has not made any announcement in the regard.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Zubair, who also remained a spokesperson for the Sharifs, said that he had, indeed, been approached to join the new party, but emphasised that that he had not decided anything yet.
Zubair said that he would first assess the situation, as to whether he could be instrumental for that party. Secondly, he added, disagreeing with one party did not mean rushing to join another party.

9,Perks: SC overrules registrar’s objections,Plea seeks to declare G-B’s ex-chief judge’s pensionary benefits as illegal,"The Supreme Court has overruled the registrar office’s objections to a petition seeking to declare entitlement of the chief judge and judges of the Gilgit-Baltistan Supreme Appellate Court, who are appointed for a fixed term of three years, to pensionary benefits as illegal.
A division bench of the apex court led by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah heard the petition filed by Muhammad Ibrahim advocate through Arif Chaudhry advocate.
During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioner argued that G-B’s chief judge is appointed for a term of three years in terms of Article 60(8) of the Gilgit-Baltistan (Empowerment and Self-Governance) Order, 2009, and, therefore, “he is not entitled to pension”.
It was submitted that pension was granted to the judges of the G-B court in the light of a judgment pronounced in 2008. However, the judgment was declared to be per incuriam (through lack of care) by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2013 regarding pensionary benefits of judges of the superior courts from the date of their retirement irrespective of their length of service as judges.
“It is contended that in view of the latest judgement law, the judges are no more entitled to pension. This aspect of the matter can best be appreciated and resolved on the judicial side; therefore, the office objection is overruled. The office is directed to number the petition and fix it for hearing on June 11, 2024,” says the written order.
The petitioner prayed the Supreme Court that the commutation of pension amounting to Rs67,306,073 (six crore thirty lac six thousand and seventy-three rupees) paid by the Accountant General of Pakistan be ordered to be recovered along with monthly pension drawn by former chief judge Rana Muhammad Shamin with effect from 01.09.2018 till to date and stoppage of monthly pension.
It is also pleaded that other privileges illegally extended to the former judge by way of provision of down payment vehicle and staff -- both regular and contingent paid -- be recalled forthwith.
The petition stated that Rana Shamim had completed his three-year term on August 30, 2018 at the age of 68 years and applied for pensionary benefits with the Auditor General of Pakistan which raised certain legal objections on the pension claim.
However, the matter was referred to the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan which allowed him the pension benefits ‘illegally’.
