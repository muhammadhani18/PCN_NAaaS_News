1,Family accuses constable of pushing woman to death from moving Faisalabad-bound train,Pakistan Railways says committee made to probe into the death of Maryam Bibi and submit a report in three days.,"LAHORE/BAHAWALPUR: Heirs of a 29-year-old woman passenger have accused a railway police official of pushing her to death from the moving train, Faisalabad-bound Millat Express, on April 7.
The death of the woman, identified as Maryam Bibi of Jaranwala, gained public attention after a viral video showed railway constable Mir Hassan abusing her and her children aboard the Millat Express. She was later found dead along the railway line.
A spokesperson for Pakistan Railway (PR) in a press release said the PR chairman has made a four-member committee, headed by the railway police south zone DIG, to probe into the death of Maryam and submit report in three days.
The press release says that Maryam, who was traveling from Karachi to Faisalabad, started scattering the belongings of other passengers. This prompted the passengers to call the police constable who assaulted the woman and moved her to another compartment. However, the constable’s duty only extended from Karachi to Hyderabad. The press release says, according to fellow passengers, the woman suddenly jumped from the moving train near Channigoth station. Once the video of the constable thrashing the woman was posted online, the constable was arrested. He has been suspended from duty and is on bail in the Hyderabad area.
Bahawalpur District Police Officer Asad Sarfraz says that the district police are also looking into the case. The DPO said in a press release that initially heirs were not ready for her postmortem examination, but later they allowed and the postmortem examination was carried out at Ahmedpur East THQ hospital. The DPO said after receipt of the postmortem examination report, further action would be taken in a transparent manner into the woman’s death.
A PR official source, however, expressed doubts over the ‘story of Maryam’s suicide by jumping out of the train’s window. The heirs of the deceased Maryam have also accused the constable of pushing her from the moving train. Maryam’s sister, who was also traveling in the same train in another coach, told a news channel that she (Maryam) remained in contact with her during the journey till reaching at a station near Bahawalpur.
“She called me that some people, including the police official, were teasing her and the two children with her on the pretext of not having a ticket (reservation). Later she told me that the police official beat her and her nephew and niece,” she told the TV channel.
She said on reaching Bahawalpur, Maryam told her that she was dragged in the train by the police. After some time, the children told her that their aunt was found dead. “The police officials pressured the kids to give a statement that she died by suicide,” she said.
One of the children (traveling with Maryam) told the media that her aunt was reciting Quran when the police guard started beating them and took the aunt to somewhere by dragging. Later, they saw her dead when the train stopped somewhere on the way.
Similarly, the mother and brother of the deceased also accused the police guard of killing Maryam. Talking to Dawn, her mother said: “My daughter was absolutely OK as there was no mental health issue with her. The police official killed her by pushing her out of the train,” she alleged.
Before Eid, reports claimed that a woman and her two children jumped from the Millat Express, resulting in her death near Channigoth railway station, 70 km from Bahawalpur. Initially, it was suggested she was mentally unstable, and despite passengers’ efforts to restrain her, she leapt from the train. However, following the viral video of her abuse, it emerged that constable Hassan stationed in Hyderabad, forcibly took her with him after torturing her during the journey on the night of April 7. Her body was later spotted  between the railway tracks near Channigoth on the morning of April 8.
Rescue 1122 in Ahmedpur East reported that upon an emergency call, their officials reached Channigoth on April 8, where they, along with police officials, found the body between the railway lines, accompanied by her two children. They shifted the body to Ahmedpur East THQ Hospital.
Maryam’s brother Muhammad Afzal also arrived in Ahmedpur East to collect the body. Due to her mutilated condition, THQ doctors were unable to perform a postmortem, only conducting X-rays on various parts. Afzal said Maryam worked at a beauty parlour in Karachi. He also filed a complaint with the police to register a murder case against the constable and his two accomplices, alleging that they also looted the deceased’s jewellery and cash from her purse.

3,"Death of a woman in crossfire:  Police baton charge protesters, including women, in Shahdara",Protesters say deceased woman died after being hit by a bullet during crossfire between two rival groups.,"LAHORE: The police on Monday allegedly trashed and baton charged protesters, including women, who were staging a demo by placing the dead body of a young woman on a road, after she was killed during crossfire between two rival groups in Shahdara area.
The protesters, chanting slogans against police, said the deceased woman, Ayesha Nazir (24), died after being hit by a bullet during crossfire between two rival groups who had been resorting to firing in the area since long.
They alleged that despite repeated complaints by locals against the rival armed groups, the local police turned a deaf ear, resulting in the killing of the young woman.
They said Ayesha was going to market when the rival groups’ men opened fire on each other following a scuffle, and a bullet hit her, resulting in her death.    
The locals alleged that a delayed response by police resulted in the woman’s death and demanded action against those responsible for the incident.
Because of the protesters blocking the main road, a massive traffic jam occurred there for many hours.
Eyewitnesses say that a large number of police personnel led by the DSP concerned reached the spot and held negotiations with protesters to convince them to clear the road for traffic. However, the protesters refused to budge.
After failure of the dialogue, the police baton charged the protesters, including women, to disperse them.
Later, the police high-ups engaged the elders of the area and managed to disperse the protesters, assuring them of action against those responsible for the woman’s death.
The police shifted the woman’s body to the city morgue for an autopsy and dispatched teams for the arrests of the armed men who resorted to firing.

4,LHC orders IGP to submit detail of cases against Fawad Chaudhry,Justice Neelum directs IGP to submit a detailed reply explaining why no investigation was conducted while the petitioner was in jail.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday ordered Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Anwar to submit a reply to a petition by former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry seeking details of the cases registered against him.
Earlier, a two-member bench led by Justice Aalia Neelum summoned the IGP on a short notice and warned a Punjab government’s lawyer that the court did not want a “TikTok” presentation from the provincial police chief.
The government lawyer told the court that as many as 40 cases had been registered against the petitioner.
Justice Neelum asked the law officer why no investigation was conducted during the four-month incarceration of the petitioner.
The lawyer admitted that the investigating officer should have probed the petitioner.
The judge asked whether any action had been taken against the police officials involved.
Being dissatisfied with the law officer’s assistance, Justice Neelum gave him ten minutes to bring the IGP to the court.
When IGP Anwar appeared, the judge asked him to explain why the investigating officers failed to investigate the petitioner in the jail.
The IGP said various cases were registered against the petitioner in different locations.
Justice Neelum asked Mr Anwar what efforts his investigators made to conduct the investigation.
The IGP said there were certain legal requirements for conducting an investigation.
As Justice Neelum repeated the question, the IGP defended the neutrality of the police, saying the petitioner was acquitted in some cases where he was found innocent.
He said the police would submit record of all cases against Mr Chaudhry.
Senior lawyer Ahsan Bhoon said the former minister had been arrested twice — first under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) and then again in November 2023.
He said during the period of his arrests, Chaudhry was remanded for a total 41 days in various cases.
Justice Neelum questioned why there were six FIRs filed on the same day against the petitioner.
Mr Anwar said, “My Lord, please hear me out, we have formed various JITs.”
The judge directed the IGP not to make such statements before the bench and to submit a detailed reply, explaining why no investigation was conducted while the petitioner was in jail.
The judge ordered the IGP to file his reply in a day.
Mr Anwar said his team would present the reply to the court on Tuesday (today) as he needed to go to the Katcha area (in south Punjab) to monitor an ongoing operation against dacoits.
However, Justice Neelum ordered the IGP to personally submit the reply.
MEDIA TALK: Responding to media queries in the high court, Fawad Chaudhry said the decision about his politics was to be made by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder.
“I will do whatever the PTI founder says,” he said, adding that it was very easy for them
(PTI) to win the election on the basis of Form 47. “We have chosen the difficult path,” he said.
He said bitterness cannot be increased in the country during the current situation.
“I could say bitter things about what happened to me,” Chaudhry said and added bitter words were not beneficial for Pakistan.
He said that bitterness, whether with the establishment or among the political parties, needed to be reduced.
How a conducive environment for a dialogue can be created, while keeping Imran Khan in jail, he asked.
Separately, an anti-terrorism court granted pre-arrest bail to Fawad Chaudhry in four cases of May 9 riots.
The court restrained the police from arresting the former minister till April 20 and summoned record of the cases.

5,"Lesco overbilled Lahore consumers for 830m units last year, says interior minister",LAHORE: The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) overbilled the consumers in Lahore and its adjoining districts ...,"LAHORE: The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) overbilled the consumers in Lahore and its adjoining districts for 830 million units last year, says Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. 
“We have evidence that as many as 830 million units were overbilled by the Lahore Electric Supply Company in 2023, and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has launched an action, arresting two (Lesco) executive engineers so far,” the interior minister told a press conference at the FIA provincial headquarters here on Monday.
Naqvi says Lesco overbilled even the consumers using just 300 units.
“Overbilling was resorted to in the government offices, the industry and even to the common man who consumed only 300 units. For example, a consumer who was to pay Rs20,000 bill against the units he used, had to pay Rs40,000 bill against the overcharged units, which is unfortunate and those responsible for it will face law,” he said and added the FIA’s campaign against overbilling would continue. “We fully support the FIA’s crackdown against overbilling,” he added. 
Meanwhile, Lesco officers observed a strike on Monday against the FIA’s action, terming it harassment and demanded that the agency should share the data regarding the overbilled units with proof.
Lahore, Kasur, Okara, Sheikhupura and Nankana districts fall in the Lesco jurisdiction.
Meanwhile, about the facilities planned for the passengers at airports, Mr Naqvi said steps were being taken to increase counters at the Lahore airport to make immigration process hassle-free.
He added that electronic gates would also be introduced at airports so that the passport scanning process could be carried out without immigration officers.
To a question, he said strict laws were needed to regulate social media. Citing the example of Gulf states, he said that strict legislation was the need of the hour to check “fake information”.
Earlier, Sub Inspector Faiza Shahzad inaugurated the Shaheed Shahzad Younas Investigation Block at the FIA building.
On the occasion, the interior minister paid tributes to the martyred inspector.
He also visited different sections of the newly-inaugurated investigation block.
FIA Director General Ahmad Ishaque Jehangir, Lahore Director Sarfraz Virk and other officers were also present.

A two-member bench headed by Justice Aalia Neelum was hearing the senator’s petition.
The bench directed the government’s lawyer to also submit the gazette notification of the jail trial along with the report.
The bench also instructed the law officer to clarify whether the jail trial was approved for just one or all cases of the May 9 riots. The hearing was adjourned for a week.
The senator through a counsel contended that the provincial government with ulterior motives approved jail trials in the FIRs relating to the May 9 protests only to harass the suspects.
He stated that the jail trial cannot be termed open and fair as the concept of jail trial is against the fundamentals of due process of law.
He said a jail trial is a violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to fair trial and due process of law.  
The counsel stated that the trial court also approved the decision of the government and started the jail trial against the petitioner in two cases of attacks on the Jinnah House and Shadman police station.
He asked the court to set aside the decision of the provincial government and the trial court for being unconstitutional. The PTI senator is on judicial remand in several cases of the May 9 riots registered against the leaders and workers of the party.

13,"Farmers demand raise in wheat support price, procurement target","Warn of protests, sit-in outside Punjab Assembly; say even official price is not being implemented","LAHORE: Wheat farmers have demanded the Punjab government increase minimum support price and double the wheat procurement target from two million tonnes to four million tonnes. They warned of protests if their demands were not fulfilled. 
Speaking at a press conference here on Monday, Pakistan Kisan Ittehad President Khalid Khokhar said the farmers were concerned at the reports that the provincial government had reduced wheat procurement target from the previous years’ four metric tonnes to two million tonnes this year on the excuse that it had enough carry-over stock. 
Blaming the last caretaker set-up for importing 3.2 million tonne wheat at the cost of precious foreign exchange only for vested interest, ignoring the pleas of farmers, Khokhar urged Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to fix the procurement target at four million tonnes like the previous years for controlling the falling grain prices that had come down to Rs3,200 per 40kg against the official minimum support price of Rs3,900. 
The PKI leader urged the CM to approach the federal government for making fertiliser, electricity and diesel affordable for the growers of Punjab, which was guaranteeing food security for the whole country. He regretted that various countries were effectively making 20-year plans for their agriculture sector while Pakistani authorities could not ensure provision of compost even for one month. 

Warn of protests, sit-in outside Punjab Assembly; say even official price is not being implemented 

Lauding the steps taken for the agriculture sector by the incumbent set-up, Mr Khokhar demanded the government take the farmers on board. 
In a separate press conference, farmer leaders, Khalid Batth and Mian Umair Masood, regretted that for the first time in the history of the country neither public nor private sector was ready to pick wheat from the growers while the mafia was purchasing grain from the poor farmers at a rate from Rs2,200 to Rs2,800 per 40kg. 
Wearing shrouds, they said the Arhtis from whom farmers would get loans for seed and fertiliser were blackmailing the borrowers/farmers who were ready to sell wheat at a rate equal to their production cost. 
They demanded the government ensure procurement of grain at its officially announced rate of Rs3,900 per 40kg; otherwise, they threatened that farmers would launch a sit-in outside the Punjab Assembly from April 29 and end the protest only when the official rate would be guaranteed. 
The farmer leaders said the farming community was being forced to sell wheat at lower rates while the urban consumers were being provided wheat flour at higher rates. They blamed the bureaucrats for creating a situation in which neither the rural nor urban population was benefiting from a bumper wheat crop.

14,Wheat farmers’ plight persists in Punjab,"SAHIWAL: Despite the Punjab government’s declaration of a support price for wheat at Rs3,900, the market witnesses...","SAHIWAL: Despite the Punjab government’s declaration of a support price for wheat at Rs3,900, the market witnesses wheat being sold at from Rs3,000 to Rs3,100 per 40 kg. 
This disparity arises from the provincial food department’s failure to announce any procurement schedule or targets for wheat purchase from the open market. 
The situation has triggered panic among the activists of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI) and Kissan Ittehad. Both organisations have launched social media campaigns, urging farmers not to sell their crops at low prices and to hold onto their produce for the time being. 
However, the ongoing rain spells exacerbate the issue, especially for farmers who have already harvested their crops, leaving heaps of wheat exposed in fields due to a lack of storage capacity at their disposal. The ongoing spell of rain is another concern for growers, leaving them with no option but to sell their crops at throwaway prices.
PKI Provincial President Rizwan Iqbal criticised the recently announced government policy, which limits wheat purchase to a mere 15 maunds or 600 kg per acre of production for any farmer. 
PKI President Khalid Mahmood Khookar expressed concerns over the surplus wheat production anticipated due to the previous caretaker government’s import of 3.2 million tons of wheat. 
He said that the government has 4.8 million tons of wheat in its stocks, indicating a grim outlook for farmers as it implies a lack of demand at the announced support price. 
The limited buying of wheat is making farmers fear that the market will crash due to overproduction. Farmers attributed this predicament to a conspiracy against them who consistently yield bumper wheat crops but struggle to find buyers at the announced support price of the government. 
The PKI announced plans to protest by staging demonstrations outside the offices of all 36 deputy commissioners in Punjab. The PKI demanded immediate intervention from Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, urging her to convene a meeting with representatives of farmers’ professional bodies to address the pressing issue.
Mr Rizwan said that this year’s wheat production has surged by 25-30%, and the government’s reluctance to purchase wheat in limited quantities would lead to a market crash, adversely impacting farmers. 
Reports say that wheat is already being sold at Rs3,000 and Rs2,900 per 40 kg in the grain markets of Pakpattan and Sahiwal. 
Muhammad Sheraz, a wheat grower from 77/4-R, said that if the government delayed purchasing wheat or imposed limitations on procurement, it would inevitably result in a market collapse, further exacerbating the plight of farmers. 
He said then it will badly affect the upcoming cotton crop as farmers will have no cash to buy inputs for the cotton crop.
