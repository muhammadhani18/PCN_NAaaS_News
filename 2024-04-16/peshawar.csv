In a statement, Mr Aimal said that his party’s leadership and workers sympathised with families, which lost members to the downpour in the province, and stood with them in “this hour of grief and suffering.”
He said that authorities should reach out to the victims of downpour without delay with all possible assistance.
The ANP leader also called for immediate steps by the government to evacuate the people from “unsafe” areas.
He said that the “irreparable” damage caused by torrential rains to public property and crops would have a very negative impact on people’s lives.
Mr Aimal said while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was already ravaged by unrest and mismanagement, the poor residents suffered more from natural calamities in the form of rains.
“It is the duty of the provincial government to provide relief to the calamity-affected families on an emergency basis to alleviate their sufferings. Officials of the relevant departments should ensure the timely access of the people in need to the relief,” he said.
The ANP leader said that his party’s office-bearers and workers along with volunteers of the Khudai Khidmatgar organisation would ensure the relief of the rain-hit people facing a difficult time.

4,KP health department orders establishment of medical camps in inaccessible areas,"Says move will ensure provision of medical care to residents, prevent outbreak of diseases.","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has directed the district health officers in the province to establish medical camps in the inaccessible rain-hit areas to immediately provide medical care to the people in need and prevent the outbreak of diseases.
The DHO will also take steps to “strengthen surveillance to prevent and control water- and food-borne diseases,” according to a notification issued by the director-general (health services).
It added that it had become very important due to the continuous rains to increase vigilance and strengthen surveillance to deal with the challenges of public health.
“The health minister has already expressed apprehensions about the flood-related health issues, and therefore, all district health officers and medical superintendents of hospitals are required to stay on duty and monitor the situation in their respective districts,” read the notification.
The DG said all hospitals should ensure an adequate stock of essential medicines to ensure effective treatment of patients with water- and food-related issues.

Says move will ensure provision of medical care to residents, prevent outbreak of diseases

He added that urgent attention was required for the rain-induced situation.
The director-general also ordered the deployment of healthcare providers in the areas where accessibility isn’t easy and the establishment of temporary medical camps so the people can be given medical aid.
“These camps should ensure immediate relief to the patients besides the surveillance of diseases and preventive measures,” he said in the notification.
The DG said the district health authorities should update him on the prevalence of diseases in their rain-hit areas on a daily basis so that measures could be taken to prevent the outbreak of communicable and other diseases.
He said surveillance was essential for the early detection of diseases, prompt response, and effective control and prevention of diseases amid heavy rainfall.
Meanwhile, officials told Dawn that the health department was facing problems mobilising staff members and transporting medicines to patients in flood-hit areas due to the disruption of the communication network in areas badly hit by rain and floods.
They said there was a high likelihood of cases of diarrhea, acute respiratory and skin diseases, and snakebites rising in the affected regions, and therefore, the health department was going to set up medical camps in inaccessible areas.
The officials said the department had been reporting cases from flood-hit areas in the past as well.
They said the people in those areas required clean drinking water and safe food to prevent diseases.
The officials said most of the calamity-hit districts needed medicines for diarrhea, skin, and chest infections, which were mostly reported in children.
They also said the district required medical supplies and antibiotics.
The officials said in the last floods, the department recorded cholera cases in some areas due to the consumption of contaminated water, and therefore, people should use boiled water to stay safe from that acute intestinal infection.
They said people in many districts were surrounded by standing water, rendering them more vulnerable to mosquito bites that could cause malaria and dengue fever.
The officials added that health facilities in those areas weren’t reachable, and therefore, medical camps were required.
They said the people, who suffered from hypertension and diabetes required continuous treatment, so they’re highly vulnerable in flood situations as doctors weren’t readily available in the local hospitals.
The officials said the department was also focusing on people with serious diseases as well as pregnant women.

Mr Afridi promised using the oil and gas royalty funds for development projects.
He said youth had been denied jobs in the oil and exploration companies, which had made trillions since the first discovery in 2003. “The oil and gas exploration firms would be asked to accommodate youth.”

7,Learning loss feared as schoolchildren fail to  get free textbooks,Officials insist books available neither with textbook board nor on the market,"PESHAWAR: As the new academic year in government schools of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa began on Monday, students were troubled by the failure of authorities to provide them with free textbooks.
Neither the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Textbook Board has printed books nor are they available on the market, according to officials.
They told Dawn that usually, schoolchildren received free course books from the provincial government at the start of the academic year in April.
The officials said students would suffer learning loss in the event of any further delay in the provision of books.
A senior official of the elementary and secondary education department told Dawn that the KP Textbook Board would require one and a half months to print books and supply them to public sector schools if the government immediately released the required funds of Rs8 billion.

Officials insist books available neither with textbook board nor on the market

He said the government hadn’t given away a single penny to the textbook board for payment to private companies to print course books for schools.
The official said not only had the provincial government denied Rs8 billion funds required to print books for the academic year 2024–25, but it had also not cleared Rs10 billion dues over the last few years.
He said under the laid-down procedure, the provincial government had to pay printers in Oct 2023 for printing books, but authorities didn’t take the matter seriously.
The official said the books to be printed for the current academic year were to cost around Rs11 billion, but the amount was reduced to Rs8 billion by the provincial government following its decision, amid a financial crisis, to reduce the size of textbooks and provide half of the schoolchildren with old course books to save over Rs3 billion.
He said in line with the decision of the government, the education department had already directed headmasters of public sector schools in the province to utilise 50 per cent of the old books collected from students in grades 6–12.
The official said similarly, the students in grades 4-5 would use 20 per cent of the old books, while new books would be provided to the students of grade 3 and below.
Sources in the textbook board told Dawn that the board as well as the elementary and secondary education department had been requesting the finance department since October 2023 to release funds for printing books to prevent students from any trouble at the start of the academic year, but the latter didn’t care, and therefore, the students had to attend new classes without course books.
“Now, books are neither available with the textbook board nor on the market,” a schoolchild’s father told Dawn.
He wondered how students would have lessons without books.
“For the second consecutive year, authorities have failed to ensure the provision of free textbooks to schoolchildren on time. It is nothing but a callous act on their part,” he said.
A schoolteacher told Dawn that most of the books collected from students after their promotion to the next grade were in bad shape and therefore, they couldn’t be used.
“We felt embarrassed while giving away the ‘overused’ books to the students, who accepted them halfheartedly,” he said.
The teacher said most students enrolled in government schools were too poor to afford book binding costs, damaging textbooks.
A senior official of the provincial textbook board told Dawn that incomplete book sets were dispatched to Malakand, Swabi, Hangu, Tank, and Kohat districts.
He said the printing of books was under way and would take a few weeks for completion.
The official said the funding denial by the government delayed the printing of school books.
He said the textbook board published advertisements in newspapers several times for book printing contracts, as the owners of private printing companies were reluctant to participate in the bidding because the government was not giving away funds to the textbook board.
Minister for the elementary and secondary education department Faisal Khan Tarakai was not available for comments.

“Not only will we resume the dam’s work, but construction of the Shungli Dam, too, will begin soon,” he said.

complete 100 years of its construction in July this year. 
The Katoor dynasty ruled the then Chitral state from 1896 to 1936.
Situated near the royal fort on the bank of Chitral River, the mosque gives a spectacular view as this iconic white structure adorned by tall chinar trees on its three sides can be seen from any part of the Chitral town.
Five snow white domes, one each on all four sides with a larger one in the centre on the front side coupled with two minarets of about 120 feet each gives the mosque a distinctive look. 
The mosque’s hall is delicately decorated with murals and hanging lamps.
The hall can accommodate about 3,000 worshipers at a time with additional space available in the garden attached to one of its entrance gates.
Maulana Khaleequz Zaman, the khateeb of the mosque, told Dawn that its construction began in 1919 and completed in 1924. He said masons with experience of Mughal architecture were hired from Lahore.
He said the mosque was a miniature model of Lahore’s Badshahi Masjid and was the first building of its kind in Chitral, where red sandstones and marble were used.
He said the education department had also been running a seminary in the spacious mosque since 1950s.
Maulana Khaleeq said the 100-year glory of the mosque had left a deep imprint in the history of modern Chitral, and the people had attachment to it.
Even after the merger of the state of Chitral with Pakistan as one of its districts in 1969, the elders of the royal family kept on managing the affairs of the mosque through a committee consisting of local notables.
In 1980, then military ruler Gen Ziaul Haq provided grant-in-aid for the mosque during his visit to Chitral, and the funds were used to purchase commercial lands, ensuring a regular income accrued from the rent.

11,CDA mulls changes to by-laws to incentivise skyscrapers,"Insiders claim amendments in payment plan, floor area ratio for commercial plots on the cards","ISLAMABAD: The committee tasked to revise the by-laws of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to promote high-rise buildings in the capital held its first meeting on Monday, discussing various proposals to woo investors.
The meeting was presided over by CDA Member Engineering Dr Muhammad Khalid Hafiz and attended by director generals of planning, building and housing control, and officials of the finance and estate wings.
The meeting discussed various proposals and it was decided that a new policy would be formulated soon, which would be presented before the CDA board for approval.
On April 5, the director general of the building and housing control wing notified a six-member committee to be headed by the CDA member engineering.
The committee headed by the member engineering is tasked to review and propose amendments to the existing parameters, FAR (floor area ratio) for commercial buildings if deemed appropriate, review existing payment plans and procedures for auctioned plots, and suggest business-friendly measures in line with the policies adopted by other cities, such as Karachi and Lahore.

Insiders claim amendments in payment plan, floor area ratio for commercial plots on the cards

According to sources, the meeting held on Monday discussed various issues. As per the existing by-laws, the maximum allowed FAR is 1:10 for plots over 5000 square yards.
The participants were of the view that instead of the entire city, FAR should be increased in selective areas of the federal capital. Similarly, to make the commercial plots lucrative to investor, it also mulled increasing the payment plan from one year to three years.
“Yes, various proposals came under discussion today; we discussed the future needs of the city, its available infrastructure, and resources. We also discussed that if 1:17 FAR is allowed across Islamabad, then what will be the status of traffic management and utilities, such as water,” said a source. They added there should be some difference in the by-laws of Islamabad: the capital city and other cities. The meeting did not reach a decision and proposals are likely to be finalised in the next sitting. It is relevant to note here after getting a lacklustre response in its auction of commercial plots in recent years, the CDA management had in principle decided to bring major policy changes to promote development and business activity as well as the high-rise buildings.
Sources said the government and the CDA management were planning to increase the payment plan for commercial plots from one year to three years. It is also planning to increase the floor area ratio to 1:16.
Similarly, there is also a proposal to give possession to developers after getting 50 per cent payment, instead of 100 per cent. Sources said that during the last two years, the CDA could not attract investors during the auction of commercial plots. In contrast, the central business district in Lahore has been an attractive opportunity for investors across Pakistan, including Islamabad.
In light of such policy measures, the investors are moving to Lahore from Islamabad, claimed sources.
Former president of Islamabad Developer Association Chaudhry Naseer Ahmed told Dawn that the developers had been advocating changes to the CDA by-laws for years to make them investor-friendly.
Meanwhile, Real Estate Association President Sardar Tahir Mehmood said that his association had been asking the CDA to amend the by-laws for the past six months at least. “We also wrote a letter on March 20 in this regard,” he said, urging the CDA to do the needful.

15,Delay in BS programme at Bajaur college shatters dreams of girl students,Staffer cites shortage of teachers as main reason of delay,"BAJAUR: The prolonged delay in launch of four-year BS programme in the lone degree college for girls in Bajaur has shattered the dreams of local students to get higher education.
Students, their parents and political workers told this scribe that the management of Government Girls Degree College Khar was yet to launch BS programme in the institution despite the fact that the course had been approved by University of Malakand about eight years ago.
They said that the prolonged delay in launch of the programme was not only depriving thousands of local girl students of getting higher education but it was also a violation of government’s policy to promote female education in the province, especially in merged districts.
“I have been waiting for the launch of BS programme in the college for the last three years,” said Salma Bibi, a resident of Khar who passed FA examination from the said college some three years ago.

Staffer cites shortage of teachers as main reason of delay

Sadia Bibi, a resident of Salarzai, told this scribe that she had been waiting for getting in the programmes for about two years. “It is my dream to get enrolled in the college again but this time in one of my desired subjects home economics or international relation in the BS programmes for which I have been waiting since 2022,” she added.
She said that some of her classmates were married off by their parents while waiting for launch of BS programmes in the collage. She added that her parents had also decided to marry off her if she could not get enrolled in the college till August next.
The parents of several girl students said that like residents of other parts of the country, they also wanted their daughters to get higher education in their native district.
“I have a great desire that my daughter becomes a CSS or PMS officer or at least a lecturer. Unfortunately inordinate delay in launch of BS programme in the college is shattering my dream,” said Abdul Haq, a resident of Khar.
Bahadar Said, president of All Bajaur Private Schools Association, said that he was shocked to know that BS programme was not launched in the college. He said that it was tantamount to deprive local girls of their right to education.
Habib Hassan Yad, a right activist, told this correspondent that the college had been upgraded to degree level nine years ago. However, he said that absence of BS programme meant that the college was not upgraded properly.
A senior staffer of the college, when contacted, said that shortage of teachers was the major cause of delay in launching of the programme. She said that the college started BS Botany and Islamiat in 2017 but no student was interested in studying those subjects.
