0,‘Paris Olympics opening ceremony could move from river to stadium’,PARIS: France has prepared alternatives to holding the July 26 Olympics opening ceremony on the river Seine should...,"PARIS: France has prepared alternatives to holding the July 26 Olympics opening ceremony on the river Seine should security reasons require, President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday.
Conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as a threat of terrorist attacks have led the French government to raise its security alert to its highest level.
Macron said he was confident the planned Games ceremony with huge crowds around the Seine, where some 160 boats would set off for a 6km journey, would be a huge success.
But France, he added, is not naive.
“If we think there are security risks we’ll have plan Bs, and even plan Cs,” he said.
One option, he said, would be to restrict the ceremony to the central Paris Trocadero square facing the Eiffel Tower. Another would be to move the event to the Stade de France stadium.
Macron then tried — and failed — to convince a mother, worried about security risks, to let her son go to the river Seine ceremony.
“If there is one place where your son will be safe it will be there,” Macron told the mother, who asked her question during a BFM TV and RMC radio interview.
“Let him go, it’s once every 100 years, the Olympics [in Paris].”
The unconvinced mother responded that she hoped her son would work that day and be unable to attend.
Macron, who gave his interview from Paris’ Grand Palais museum, which has just been refurbished to host the fencing and taekwondo competitions, said he had not changed his mind about swimming in the Seine.
Paris has been working on cleaning up the Seine so that people can swim in it again, as was the case during the 1900 Paris Olympics. But a sewer problem last summer led to the cancellation of a pre-Olympics swimming event.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo is also promising to swim in the Seine — more than three decades after her predecessor Jacques Chirac famously promised to do it but never did.
The United States Olympic and Paralympic leadership are comfortable with the river Seine security plans the hosts have for the opening ceremony, the team’s security head Nicole Deal said.
“Definitely an unprecedented opening ceremony,” she told reporters in New York.
“We’re outside and it’s going to be four miles long. I’ve been working with the French, and they have put tons of resources... and capabilities in place, a lot that you don’t see. And they’ve been working on this plan for a long time.”

1,Olympics flame to be lit in its Greek birthplace,"OLYMPIA: Nearly 100 days before the 2024 Paris Games open, the Olympic flame will be lit in ancient Olympia Tuesday...","OLYMPIA: Nearly 100 days before the 2024 Paris Games open, the Olympic flame will be lit in ancient Olympia Tuesday for a torch relay stretching from the Acropolis to French Polynesia.
For the first time since events for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games had to be toned down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, spectators will be able to attend the torch relay events.
Some 600 dignitaries are expected at the ceremony on Tuesday, headed by Greek President Katerina Sakellar­opoulou and International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach.
The ritual will see actresses in the role of ancient priestesses coaxing the Olympic flame into life with the help of a parabolic polished mirror in Olympia, southwestern Greece, where the Games were born in 776 BC.
American mezzo soprano Joyce DiDonato is to deliver the Olympic anthem.
The ceremony is conducted at the ruins of the 2,600-year-old Temple of Hera, and sets off the Olympic torch relay that marks the countdown for each Games.
Cloudy skies are forecast for Tuesday, but the flame was successfully lit in a rehearsal on Monday, a backup that can be used if necessary during the official ceremony.
The torch harks back to the ancient Olympics, when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games. 
The tradition was revived in 1936 for the Berlin Games.
The first relay runner will be Greece’s 2020 Olympics rowing champion Stefanos Ntouskos.
The Hellenic Olympic Committee confirmed on Monday that retired French swimmer Laure Manaudou, who won her first gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, will follow Ntouskos as France’s first torchbearer in Olympia.
European Commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas will follow as the third torchbearer, the HOC said.
During the 11-day relay on Greek soil, some 600 torch-bearers will carry the flame over a distance of 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles) through 41 municipalities.
“We had prepared this programme for the Tokyo Olympics, but the pandemic did not allow us to carry it out,” Thanassis Vassiliadis, head of the Hellenic Olympic Committee’s torch relay committee, told Kathimerini daily last week.
He added that security levels at the flame-lighting ceremony will be  “the highest” possible with police  “discreet but present everywhere.”  “Nobody will be able to enter the grounds without accreditation,” he said.
The Olympic flame will be handed over to Paris 2024 organisers in a ceremony at the all-marble Panathenaic Stadium, site of the first modern Olympic Games of 1896, on April 26.
Nana Mouskouri, the 89-year-old Greek singer with a worldwide following, has been invited to perform at the ceremony.
On April 27, the flame will begin its journey to France on board the 19th-century three-masted barque Belem, which was launched just weeks after the 1896 Athens Games.
A French historical monument, the Belem carried out trade journeys to Brazil, Guyana and the West Indies for nearly two decades.
France’s last surviving three-mast steel-hulled boat, it is expected to arrive in Marseille on May 8.
Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories. It will travel through 400 towns and dozens of tourist attractions during its 12,000km journey through mainland France and overseas French territories in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific.
On July 26 it will form the centrepiece of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony on the river Seine.

2,Mbappe and PSG face fight to keep Champions League dream alive,"“It’s going to be a major football war,” says Barca manager Xavi Hernandez.","BARCELONA: The spectre of another disappointing exit from the Champions League hangs over Paris St Germain after a 3-2 first-leg defeat at home left them with a fight to turn around their quarter-final tie against Barcelona in Tuesday’s return.  
At first, nobody realistically expected this PSG side, in transition with a rejuvenated squad following last year’s departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar, to go on and win the Champions League this season.  
But the realisation that Kylian Mbappe would not be staying beyond the end of his contract after this campaign helped concentrate minds, with the superstar forward informing the club of his plans after the win over Real Sociedad in the last 16.  
Then came the draw for the last eight and semi-finals, which presented the French champions with a favourable path to reach the final.  
Luis Enrique’s side, who had been unconvincing in scraping through their group but came into the first leg against Barcelona on a 27-game unbeaten run stretching back five months, were saved from any prospect of meeting Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or Arsenal before the final.  
Victory against a Barca side who are not the force of old would set up a last-four tie against either Atletico Madrid or Borussia Dortmund, the kindest draw possible even if neither team could ever be taken lightly.  
However, PSG’s performance against Barcelona last Wednesday made clear Luis Enrique’s side are far from the complete team, and their most important player is not in his best form.  
Mbappe has scored 39 goals this season and the Parisians need him on his game if they are to go all the way and end the France captain’s seven-year stay at the club by winning European football’s greatest prize for the first time.  
But Mbappe did not play well in the first leg against Barca, failing to hit the target from three shots, losing the ball 13 times and being caught offside three times.  
Mbappe, however, scored a hat-trick in his last visit to Barcelona, in 2021, and Barca manager Xavi Hernandez said that his side will need to be nearly flawless in the second leg at the club’s temporary Olympic Stadium home on the city’s Montjuic hill to reach the semi-finals for the first time in five years.  
“It’s going to be a major football war,” Xavi told a press conference on Monday. “We are not a team that speculates, we will want to take the ball away from PSG and win the game. Hopefully we’ll be at our best. They’re going to demand a lot from us.”  
The victory in Paris was Barca’s first win in the Champions League knockout stage in four years and left them full of confidence as they reached six consecutive victories in all competitions.  
They are unbeaten since losing 5-3 at home to Villarreal in LaLiga in January that led to Xavi announcing he was stepping down as manager at the end of what then looked like a difficult season.  
Now, 13 competitive games without a loss later, including a commanding performance in the French capital to end PSG’s 27-game unbeaten run, Tuesday’s challenge seems to have presented itself at the perfect time.  
“Happy to be where we are, proud to be where we are. I think it’s a good moment and I’m excited. We feel it already,” Xavi said.  
HOME COMFORTS FOR DORTMUND
In Tuesday’s other quarter-final second leg, Atletico will need to hold out in front of Dortmund’s storied ‘Yellow Wall’ if they are to get back to the semi-finals for the first time since 2017. 
Dortmund trail 2-1 after the first leg in Madrid but manager Edin Terzic backed his team to turn the tables in front of their 81,500-seat Westfalenstadion crowd and the famous ‘Yellow Wall’ south stand. 
“When you go out onto the pitch in front of that stadium and start your warm-up, you are obliged to give everything and show your best,” Terzic told reporters on Monday. “It’s unique. It’s regularly sold out and it has helped us countless times over the years. 
“Before we make a transfer we talk to them and try and show what it means to play for Borussia Dortmund in this stadium. We need a good result against Atletico and we’re pretty sure our supporters want to make that happen and create a good atmosphere. So we want to pay them back.” 
The 1997 winners are looking to return to the semi-finals for the first time since 2013, when the Jurgen Klopp-coached side went down 2-1 to arch rivals Bayern Munich in the Wembley final. 
Dortmund’s league campaign has been disappointing after almost winning the Bundesliga last season but the team has shone in the Champions League, finishing top of a group containing PSG, AC Milan and Saudi-owned Newcastle United and then finishing the job against PSV Eindhoven at home to reach the quarter-finals.
They will be buoyed by Atle­t­ico’s poor form away from the Metropolitano this season. 
Diego Simeone’s men have won just five from 15 in the league. Atletico have won just one of four in Europe this season and have not kept a clean sheet away from home.

3,Spin great Underwood is no more,"LONDON: Derek Underwood, the most successful spin bowler in England’s Test cricket history, has died at the age of...","LONDON: Derek Underwood, the most successful spin bowler in England’s Test cricket history, has died at the age of 78, his former county Kent announced on Monday.
Underwood took 297 wickets in 86 Tests with his distinctive brand of brisk left-arm spin and was noted for being particularly effective on uncovered pitches, which were in use for much of a 24-year first-class career that ran from 1963 to 1987.
He famously bowled England to a Test victory over arch-rivals Australia at The Oval in 1968 on such a surface, taking 7-50 when a draw had seemed inevitable.
Underwood made his England debut as a 21-year-old in 1966 and played his last Test in 1982.
Together with outstanding wicket-keeper Alan Knott, he formed a celebrated combination for Kent and England.
Both Underwood, affectionately nicknamed ‘Deadly’, and Knott might have achieved even more success for England had they not each been involved in Kerry Packer’s breakaway World Series Cricket of the late 1970s and a rebel tour of South Africa in 1982.
Even so, Underwood’s tally of Test wickets is 42 more than the next highest by another England spinner, Graeme Swann.
After his playing career was over, Underwood served as president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the owners of London’s Lord’s Cricket Ground, for an annual term in 2009.

4,Scheffler takes Green Jacket after Amen Corner bares teeth,"“I did my best to stay calm out there,” says Scheffler after becoming the 18th player to win the Masters multiple times.","AUGUSTA: Unflappable American Scottie Scheffler claimed a second Masters title in three years on Sunday, the world number one holding steady while his biggest challengers self-destructed making their way through the infamous Amen Corner. 
Scheffler, the Green Jacket winner in 2022, began the day with a one-stroke lead over twice major winner Collin Morikawa and posted a final round of four-under 68 to finish 11-under for the week, four clear of Swedish young gun Ludvig Aberg. 
“I did my best to stay calm out there,” said Scheffler, after becoming the 18th player to win the Masters multiple times. “I tried to stay patient on the course and was able to make some key shots and key putts today to keep my round going. Ludvig played great today. He made a good move at me there on the back nine and I was fortunate to hold him off towards the end.” 
Aberg closed with a 69 to take solo second spot and cap a sensational majors debut. 
Morikawa, after tumbling down the leaderboard with double-bogeys at nine and 11, recovered with birdies at 13 and 15 to help secure a share of third place with American compatriot Max Homa and Britain’s Tommy Fleetwood at four-under. 
Scheffler, the red hot favourite coming into the year’s first major, leaves Augusta National as the planet’s undisputed best with three titles and a runner-up finish in his last four starts. 
The performance was all the more remarkable as the 27-year-old played with the added distraction of knowing he might have to return home at any moment to be with his wife for the birth of their first child. 
“It’s a very special time for both of us,” said Scheffler, before last year’s winner, Spaniard Jon Rahm, slipped the Green Jacket on him.  “I can’t put into words what it means to win this tournament again. I really can’t put into words what it’s going to be like to be a father for the first time. I’m looking forward to getting home and celebrating with Meredith.” 
It is said the Masters does not start until the back nine on Sunday, with many a Green Jacket won or lost with a trip through Amen Corner, the treacherous three-hole stretch that begins at the par four 11th. 
The drama actually started a little earlier at the ninth this year where Scheffler had a tap in birdie, that he nearly holed out for an eagle, to lead by one heading into the turn. 
All around Scheffler challengers were unravelling. Morikawa taking a double-bogey at nine to fall three shots off the pace. 
As Scheffler was piling on the pressure with birdies at eight, nine and 10, Amen Corner bared its teeth to sink the hopes of three Green Jacket contenders — Aberg, Morikawa and Homa. 
Aberg and Morikawa found water at 11, taking double-bogeys, while Homa suffered a double-bogey at the 12th after losing his ball in the bushes. 
Even Scheffler could not escape Amen Corner unscathed, his run of three birdies ending with a bogey at 11. 
But a birdie at 13 allowed Scheffler to walk away from Amen Corner at nine-under, holding a three-shot lead over Aberg with five to play. 
Aberg, however, was not waving the white flag, undoing the damage done at the 11th with back-to-back birdies at 13 and 14 to stay in sight of the leader at two back. 
“It was a dream come true to be in this situation, to feel the pressure coming down the final holes,” Aberg said. 
But Scheffler did not take his foot off the gas either, answering with a tap-in birdie at 14 and another at 16 to seal the victory. 
Scheffler matched Tiger Woods as the only players to win the Masters twice while atop the world rankings. 
He also became the fourth-youngest multiple Masters winner at age 27 behind Woods, Jack Nicklaus and the late Seve Ballesteros. 
“Scottie is an amazing golfer,” Homa said. “It’s really impressive.” 
Second-ranked Rory McIlroy, who needs only a Masters victory to complete a career grand slam, fired a 73 to finish on 292. 
“Hasn’t been my year this year but I’m going to keep coming back until it is my year,” McIlroy said. 
Third-ranked Jon Rahm, the 2023 winner, fired a 76 to finish on 297. 
Hours before the leaders took to the stage the spotlight belonged to Woods, with massive galleries lining every hole from tee to green perhaps fearing this could be one of the last times to see the golfing icon at work. 
Woods had Augusta buzzing when he claimed a record 24th consecutive made cut at Augusta National on Friday and then boldly predicted a sixth Green Jacket was in reach. 
But the American great, who has conjured up a long list of magical Masters moments, could not produce another, enduring perhaps the most miserable weekend of his career. 
The 48-year-old’s injury-battered body appeared to quit on him Saturday as he carded a 10-over 82, his worst major round as a professional, and followed up on Sunday with a five-over 77. 
He said he plans to play the year’s other three majors. “Hopefully the next three my body will cooperate,” Woods said.

5,Half marathon probes controversial victory,BEIJING: Beijing half marathon organisers said Monday they were investigating after footage shared widely online...,"BEIJING: Beijing half marathon organisers said Monday they were investigating after footage shared widely online appeared to show three African runners deliberately allowing China’s He Jie to win.
Video clips of Sunday’s race showed the Kenyans Robert Keter and Willy Mnangat, Dejene Hailu of Ethiopia and home runner He approaching the finish.
The three African runners can be seen pointing to the finish line and apparently waving He out in front, while appearing to slow down.
He, the 2023 Asian Games marathon gold medallist, won by one second.
The four had stuck toge­ther throughout the course of just over 13 miles (21km), a broadcaster noted.
“We are investigating and will announce the results to the public once they are available,” a person from the Beijing Sports Bureau, who wished to remain anonymous, told AFP.
The event’s organiser — the Beijing Sports Competition Management and International Exch­ange Center — also said an investigation had been launched.
The incident received significant attention on Chinese social media site Weibo, with some users criticising what they saw as an  “embarrassing” result.
“This will certainly be the most embarrassing championship in He Jie’s career,” one wrote.
“With such a major organiser and such a well-known event, this really pushes sportsmanship to the ground in shame,” the post said.
Track and field’s international body said it was  “aware” of the footage online and the investigation into it.
“The integrity of our sport is the highest priority at World Athletics, while this investigation is ongoing we are unable to provide further comment,” Director of Communications Jamie Fox said.

6,Lyon come back to win against Brest,LYON: An Ainsley Maitland-Niles penalty 16 minutes into second-half added time gave Olympique Lyonnais a stunning ...,"LYON: An Ainsley Maitland-Niles penalty 16 minutes into second-half added time gave Olympique Lyonnais a stunning 4-3 win against Brest on Sunday, pushing the home team up to within two points of the European spots.
It was a topsy-turvy affair in which the lead switched hands three times before Lyon eventually emerged victors well beyond the original allotted period of added time to stun second-placed Brest at the Groupama Stadium.
Corentin Tolisso opened the scoring before Steve Mounie and Romain Del Castillo struck in the space of seven minutes to give Brest a 3-1 lead but Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Tagliafico and Maitland-Niles hit back in the final 20 minutes to grab all three points for Lyon.
Pierre Sage’s side sit seventh and, after an appalling start to the Ligue 1 season, now have a realistic chance of qualifying for European football next term.
“It shows us that anything is possible with this team looking towards the end of the season,” said Lyon boss Sage.
The defeat leaves Brest still in second place but 10 points off leaders Paris Saint-Germain and one point ahead of third-placed Monaco, both of whom have a game in hand.
“We’re being taken for fools. It’s a difficult evening but we’ve been through others this season already,” bemoaned Brest coach Eric Roy, who was angry his team were not awarded an early penalty for a handball appeal against Lyon’s Jake O’Brien.
“We’ve been dealt a few blows by unfavourable decisions but that’s football today.”
Both sides finished with 10 men apiece after Tagliafico and Pierre Lees-Melou saw red for an altercation in the 86th minute.
Lyon claimed for a penalty deep into injury time after the Brest ‘keeper cleaned out Lacazette, injuring the Lyon captain.
After a lengthy VAR review, the referee pointed to the spot and Maitland-Niles made no mistake from 12 yards to claim all three points for Lyon in the 16th minute of injury time.
Meanwhile, an injury-time winner gave Nantes a precious victory away to Le Havre as Antoine Kombouare’s side went three points clear of the 15th-placed hosts and five clear of Lorient in the relegation play-off spot.
Abdoul Kader Bamba fired home three minutes into injury-time at the end of the second half to give a Nantes a crucial 1-0 victory.
“Le Havre could have won... we were able to push our limits and snatch three points out of nowhere,” said Nantes coach Kombouare.
The result leaves Le Havre two points ahead of Lorient with the 16th-placed side having played one less match.
Elsewhere, Clermont Foot picked up a point at home to Montpellier following a 1-1 draw but remained rooted to the bottom of the Ligue 1 table and six points from safety.
Muhammed Cham put the home team ahead going into the break with a penalty five minutes into first-half added time, before Tanguy Coulibaly levelled matters for Montpellier in the 56th minute.

7,"Inter set up Milan derby title shot, Roma’s Ndicka collapses",MILAN: Inter Milan will have a chance to win the Serie A title in the Milan derby despite slipping to a 2-2 home ...,"MILAN: Inter Milan will have a chance to win the Serie A title in the Milan derby despite slipping to a 2-2 home draw with lowly Cagliari on Sunday, while AS Roma defender Evan Ndicka is recovering after he collapsed during their game at Udinese.
Nicolas Viola snatched a potentially huge draw in 14th-placed Cagliari’s bid for Serie A survival as Inter failed to extend their 14-point lead at the top of the league after their closest challengers AC Milan drew a spectacular match at Sassuolo 3-3.
Viola struck with seven minutes remaining at the San Siro, shortly after Hakan Calhanoglu had fired Inter back into the lead from the penalty spot following Eldor Shom­urodov’s 64th-minute strike which levelled Marcus Thuram’s early opener.
Italian Viola could have even given Cagliari, who are four points above the relegation zone, a stunning win in stoppage time had he not headed a golden opportunity straight at Yann Sommer.
“It’s annoying not to win after going ahead twice because we wanted the victory in front of our fans,” said Inzaghi to DAZN.
“We’re very close to a big goal but we know that we still need points to make it mathematically certain.”
A win would have left Inter needing only a draw in the Milan derby on Monday week to beat the local rivals to a 20th league crown.
Instead Sunday’s draw means Inter have to win a sixth straight match against their city rivals if they are to claim the Scudetto with five matches remaining.
Regardless, save for an unprecendented collapse, it is simply a matter of time until Simone Inzaghi’s team will win the league, and it could yet come in the derby.
That would be a bitter blow for Milan, who have not been in the title race as Inter have charged off into the distance since the turn of the year.
Noah Okafor salvaged a hard-fought point for Milan in the 84th minute on a hot spring day in Reggio Emilia.
Coach Stefano Pioli made a raft of changes in the wake of a first-leg defeat to Roma in the Europa League quarter-finals and his team were two goals behind after less than 10 minutes following early strikes from Andrea Pina­monti and Armand Lauriente.
Frenchman Lauriente struck again seven minutes after the break to ultimately ensure the point that lifted second-from-bottom Sassuolo to within two points of safety.
Milan visit Rome on Thursday trying to overturn a single-goal deficit, ahead of the derby and a trip to third-placed Juventus the following weekend.Meanwhile, Roma said that Ndicka is recovering from an on-pitch collapse with an apparent chest problem which caused play at his team’s match at Udinese to be abandoned.
“Evan is feeling better and is in good spirits. He will remain in the hospital for further observations,” said Roma on social media, alongside a photo of Ndicka flexing his right bicep while sat upright in a hospital bed in Udine.
Ivory Coast’s Ndicka dropped to the ground with an apparent chest problem in the 70th minute with the teams level at 1-1 after Roma striker Romelu Lukaku levelled Roberto Pereyra’s first-half opener in the 64th minute.
Serie A told AFP that the final minutes of the match will be played at a later date, yet to be confirmed, leaving Roma on 55 points in fifth place.
De Rossi’s side are in a strong position to reach next season’s Cha­m­­pions League as they are five points ahead of sixth-placed Atalanta.
A top-five finish will almost certainly yield a spot in Europe’s top club competition thanks to Serie A teams’ shows on the continent.
Napoli’s slim chances of finishing in that five were dealt another blow after a 2-2 home draw with struggling Frosinone left the ailing champions six points behind Roma in eighth.
Frosinone stay just inside the bottom three and level on 27 points with 17th-placed Verona, who are outside the relegation zone on goal difference.

The company, named Athletic Ventures, will organise the 2026 European Athletics Championships in Birmingham and will be involved in the bidding process to bring the World Athletics Championships to Britain in 2029.
UKA has been in financial difficulties for years and its CEO Jack Buckner said on Monday that, though the partner organisations would not put funds into UKA directly, the new collaboration would enable the governing body to benefit from the financial expertise and experience of the organisations behind some of the most highly successful mass participation events in world sport.
“This is a groundbreaking model for the development of athletics and for major sports events in the UK,” Buckner told reporters.
“We believe our new partnership will transform the future of athletics in this country. We are not in this for a short-term fix — this is a strategic move.”
The new organisation will be charged with finding commercial partners, offering opportunities from grassroots activities to national events and the UK athletics teams at major championships.

10,Nadal confirms return at Barcelona Open,Says he expects to retire after the 2024 season.,"BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal has confirmed he will play this week’s Barcelona Open in what will be the Spaniard’s first event since January and first appearance on clay since 2022 French Open.
“I arrived here a bit like in a last minute decision as I didn’t know if I was going to be able to play,” the 22-time Grand Slam champ told a news conference. “Tomorrow I’m going to be on court.”
Nadal, whose last ATP Tour match was in Bris­bane before he pulled out of the Australian Open, withdrew from last week’s Monte Carlo Masters saying his body was not yet ready for competition.
Nadal has said he expects to retire after the 2024 season but is keen to play at the French Open where he has won a record 14 titles. However, his struggle to recover from hip-flexor surgery has cast doubt on whether he could continue playing.
Addressing media after practising on Monday, Nadal said it was a gift to compete in Barcelona.
“I thought ‘Can I or can’t I?’ It has been a difficult two years. I come from a major hip operation,” he told reporters.  “Things happen in the body and I couldn’t follow the schedule I wanted...
“My last year and I want to enjoy every moment. I feel ready to play tomorrow. I don’t think about how I get there. I know what the situation is, that I’m just preparing, but I’m realistic. For me, being here is a joy.”

12,Tsitsipas dismantles Ruud to secure third Monte Carlo title,MONTE CARLO: Stefanos Tsitsipas made short work of Norwegian eighth seed Casper Ruud as he seized a third Monte ...,"MONTE CARLO: Stefanos Tsitsipas made short work of Norwegian eighth seed Casper Ruud as he seized a third Monte Carlo Masters title in four years with a 6-1, 6-4 victory on Sunday.
Tsitsipas dominated proceedings against fellow 25-year-old Ruud from the onset, cruising through six consecutive games to wrap up the opening set in 36 minutes.
The second set was a much closer affair but Tsitsipas proved too strong for Ruud, as the Greek became the first player in the professional era to win his first three Monte Carlo finals in straight sets.
Tsitsipas, who handed Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner just his second defeat of the year in the semi-finals on Saturday, secured his first title of 2024, taking his career haul to 11.
“It’s been very difficult. To be back on the podiums and winning tournaments feels amazing,” Tsitsipas said. “I can’t thank enough my family and friends... for making this possible.
“The trinity is even more special than the first or second time. This is purely unbelievable for me. Capturing that win today was nerve-wracking. I really wanted the trinity so I got it. I’m extremely happy today.”
Tsitsipas produced 30 winners to the 20 of Ruud who had reached the  final with victory over world number one Novak Djokovic on Saturday.
He  is the fifth man to win three or more Monte Carlo titles, joining  Rafael Nadal (11) and Bjorn Borg, Thomas Muster and Ilie Nastase who won  three apiece.
The Greek struck first with a break in the third game of the opening set, then saved three break points to lead 3-1.
Tsitsipas earned a double break for 4-1 and claimed the set as Ruud double-faulted after 36 minutes.
In the second set, Tsitsipas got out of trouble in a 13-minute game, saving three break points at 3-3 after leading 40-0.
He claimed the title three games later on a first match point, a forehand winner down the line.
Tsitsipas’s father and long-time coach Apostolos insisted he never doubted his son’s abilities. 
“Stefanos, he’s a dreamer. I could say that also he’s still young in his soul, in his mind,” Apostolos told atptour.com. 
“As every young person they need to believe in life, they need to  believe in the targets they put. That’s why we are there, to remind them  that they deserve to be whatever they are.”
Having come into the claycourt Masters 1000 event with an 11-6 win-loss record for 2024, Tsitsipas returned to the world’s top 10 on Monday after dropping out for the first time since 2019 earlier in the year.
But it was yet another heartbreak for former French and US Open finalist Ruud, who lost the Mexican and Los Cabos Open final earlier this year.
“I’d like to congratulate Stef for winning Monte Carlo once again,” Ruud said.  “You (Tsitsipas) love this tournament. Very, very well played all week.
“I know you fell out of top 10 a few weeks ago but you’re back again where I think you belong. You’re a fantastic player and especially on clay and Monte Carlo... Congratulations to you and your team.”
