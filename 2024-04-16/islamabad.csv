1,Centralised grade 5 exams discontinued in Islamabad schools,ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Federal Education and the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) have decided to...,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Federal Education and the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) have decided to discontinue the centralised examination system for grade five in Islamabad-based schools.
The FDE used to conduct centralised examinations of grades five and eight every year, and students of private schools were also allowed to appear in these examinations. The directorate had a complete directorate, but this year, the results were compiled by a private firm hired for teacher training.
On Monday, it was decided that from now on, the centralised exam for fifth grade would not be held to reduce the workload of students.
“After careful consideration, it has been decided to discontinue the centralised examination system for grade 5 in the FDE schools. This move aims to alleviate exam stress and anxiety, as well as eliminate unwarranted comparison and competition among peers. By removing this pressure, we can create space for children to focus on developing other essential life skills and engaging in sports activities,” read a statement issued here on Monday.
It added that while centralised exams will no longer be conducted, summative internal diagnostic assessments will continue to ensure teachers’ accountability.
“We believe that learning extends far beyond the stress of exams and that the early years of schooling should be joyful and enriching,” the statement said.
It added that to further enhance students’ experiences, “We [the Education Ministry and FDE] will introduce a range of co-curricular activities and non-assessed initiatives, providing children with opportunities for holistic development and exploration beyond traditional academic measures.”
The FDE also used to offer scholarships to around 150 students annually, and students were given a nominal annual scholarship. As per an FDE official, the exam for eighth grade will continue to be held as per routine.
Meanwhile, the ministry of education also notified the time-scale promotion of 529 FDE teachers who run schools and colleges. The meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) was held in January, but notification was issued on Monday. The teaching community appreciated Secretary Education for getting notification of their promotions.

2,Tandoors flout govt order for cut in Roti price,"Association president says order can only be followed after subsidy; Pindi admin arrests two bakers, imposes hefty fines","RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: The tandoors in Rawalpindi division and Islamabad refused to comply with a government directive which reduced the price of Roti from Rs20 to Rs16 and Naan to Rs20 from Rs25, as they continued to sell it at its previous rates.
The price of Roti was reduced by the Punjab government on Sunday without the input of the Naanbai associations whereas the Islamabad administration reduced the price on Monday with immediate effect.
Despite notifications, the price remained unchanged in almost all markets of the twin cities.
Residents in Rawalpindi said that the announcement of the government was merely a publicity stunt since the order ignored the situation on the ground. The bakers claimed that the ex-mill price of flour and a recent exorbitant hike in gas prices made it difficult for them to comply with new rates.

Association president says order can only be followed after subsidy; Pindi admin arrests two bakers, imposes hefty fines

Mohammad Rafique, a resident of Committee Chowk, said there was no reduction in the price of Naan in his area as he bought 10 Naans for Rs250. He said the government should implement the decision to bring down the prices.
Shahmir Khan, a resident of Chaudhry Bostan Khan Road, said the bakers did not accept the new rates and said they would sell the Roti and Naan at prices fixed by the local Naanbai association.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that the new rates of Roti were notified and the order would be implemented within a day or two. He said the price magistrates had been asked to check the markets and bazaars and register cases against all those bakers who refused to accept the notified rates of Roti.
He said the price magistrates inspected 81 sites and imposed Rs105,000 fines on 28 bakers. He claimed that the district officials held a meeting with the Naanbai association in the afternoon and it was decided that new rates would be implemented on the directives of the Punjab government in letter and spirit.
Islamabad reduces price
On the other hand, the capital administration on Monday fixed the price of Roti and Naan at Rs16 and Rs20, respectively. 
According to a notification issued by the office of the district magistrate, the price of a Roti weighing 120 grams each has been fixed at Rs16. Besides, the price of a Naan weighing 120 grams each has been fixed at Rs20. 
However, Roti is being sold between Rs20 and Rs25 in the capital. 
For instance, in G-8, it is being sold at Rs20 whereas in E-11, it is being sold at Rs25. 
The notification said the new rates would remain enforced till further orders, the notification said.
It added that contravention of the order will be punishable under Section 6 and 7 of Price Control, Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act 1977 and West Pakistan Food Stuffs (Control) Act 1958
After the issuance of the notification, the Secretariat assistant commissioner held a meeting with the Naanbai association and others to discuss the new price.
In June 2023, the capital administration fixed the price of Roti weighing 120 grams at Rs18, but the price of Naan remained unchanged.
Taxila tandoors fail to comply
In Taxila, a similar situation prevailed as the tandoors refused to follow the new prices.
A market survey by Dawn showed that tandoors in Taxila and Wah were selling the bread at the previous rate of Rs20.
All Pakistan Naanbai Association President Shafeeq Qureshi told Dawn that they were ready to follow the new rates if they were provided with subsidy. He said a 40-kilogramme bag of flour was available in the market for Rs1,250 while fine flour (maida) was available for Rs1,400 per 40kg.
He said the price could only be curtailed if there was a reduction in the ex-mill price. 
He threatened to announce a shutter-down strike across the province if the district administration imposed a fine or arrest the Naanbais to forcefully implement the new rates through price magistrates.
“The government needs to reduce the ex-mill price of the flour before we can provide relief to the public,” said Wali Khan, Taxila’s president of the Naanbai association
“We will sell roti at Rs16 if the provincial government provides us flour at cheaper rates,” he said, adding that the new rates would cause “huge losses” to tandoor owners.

3,CDA mulls changes to by-laws to incentivise skyscrapers,"Insiders claim amendments in payment plan, floor area ratio for commercial plots on the cards.","ISLAMABAD: The committee tasked to revise the by-laws of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to promote high-rise buildings in the capital held its first meeting on Monday, discussing various proposals to woo investors.
The meeting was presided over by CDA Member Engineering Dr Muhammad Khalid Hafiz and attended by director generals of planning, building and housing control, and officials of the finance and estate wings.
The meeting discussed various proposals and it was decided that a new policy would be formulated soon, which would be presented before the CDA board for approval.
On April 5, the director general of the building and housing control wing notified a six-member committee to be headed by the CDA member engineering.
The committee headed by the member engineering is tasked to review and propose amendments to the existing parameters, FAR (floor area ratio) for commercial buildings if deemed appropriate, review existing payment plans and procedures for auctioned plots, and suggest business-friendly measures in line with the policies adopted by other cities, such as Karachi and Lahore.

Insiders claim amendments in payment plan, floor area ratio for commercial plots on the cards

According to sources, the meeting held on Monday discussed various issues. As per the existing by-laws, the maximum allowed FAR is 1:10 for plots over 5000 square yards.
 
 

The participants were of the view that instead of the entire city, FAR should be increased in selective areas of the federal capital. Similarly, to make the commercial plots lucrative to investor, it also mulled increasing the payment plan from one year to three years.
“Yes, various proposals came under discussion today; we discussed the future needs of the city, its available infrastructure, and resources. We also discussed that if 1:17 FAR is allowed across Islamabad, then what will be the status of traffic management and utilities, such as water,” said a source. They added there should be some difference in the by-laws of Islamabad: the capital city and other cities.
The meeting did not reach a decision and proposals are likely to be finalised in the next sitting. It is relevant to note here after getting a lacklustre response in its auction of commercial plots in recent years, the CDA management had in principle decided to bring major policy changes to promote development and business activity as well as the high-rise buildings.
Sources said the government and the CDA management were planning to increase the payment plan for commercial plots from one year to three years. It is also planning to increase the floor area ratio to 1:16.
Similarly, there is also a proposal to give possession to developers after getting 50 per cent payment, instead of 100 per cent. Sources said that during the last two years, the CDA could not attract investors during the auction of commercial plots. In contrast, the central business district in Lahore has been an attractive opportunity for investors across Pakistan, including Islamabad.
In light of such policy measures, the investors are moving to Lahore from Islamabad, claimed sources.
Former president of Islamabad Developer Association Chaudhry Naseer Ahmed told Dawn that the developers had been advocating changes to the CDA by-laws for years to make them investor-friendly.
Meanwhile, Real Estate Association President Sardar Tahir Mehmood said that his association had been asking the CDA to amend the by-laws for the past six months at least. “We also wrote a letter on March 20 in this regard,” he said, urging the CDA to do the needful.

RCCI President Saqib Rafiq, in a statement, said that the timely payment of Eurobond has negated the negative propaganda that Pakistan is going to default.
He said that the payment will not only increase the confidence and trust of external investors, the IMF and the World Bank, in Pakistan’s economy but will also show significant progress towards economic stabilisation.
Despite the payment, the rupee has not come under pressure, and the value of the rupee has stabilised against the dollar, he added.
Mr Rafiq further said that there is only one demand from the government, which is that the chambers of commerce be involved in economic policy-making.
He noted that in order to stabilise the economy on a solid footing, it is necessary to reduce unnecessary expenses, focus on industrialisation so that the country’s economy can stand on its own feet, and minimise dependence on external financial institutions.

8,"Three drown as rain damages roads, properties in AJK",MUZAFFARABAD: At least three persons drowned and a fourth one was recovered with critical wounds in two different...,"MUZAFFARABAD: At least three persons drowned and a fourth one was recovered with critical wounds in two different incidents in Neelum valley of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Monday, as torrential rains continued to play havoc with road infrastructure and properties in some parts of the state, officials said.
Elsewhere, four persons were injured in rain-related incidents in the jurisdiction of Muzaffarabad district, they added.
Akhtar Ayoub, disaster management officer in Neelum district, told Dawn by telephone that Safeeda Bibi, 35, and her two children – Faizan, 10, and Adiba, 5 – were walking along the Rantha Galli stream near Kutton village of Jagran area when a mudslide hit and pushed them into the raging torrent.
Miraculously, the violent stream threw the young boy towards the bank after some 150 metres from where villagers rescued him in critical condition. He was rushed to CMH Muzaffarabad after preliminary treatment at a local facility.
The body of the woman was recovered by villagers some 500 metres away, but the young girl could not be found till late evening, Mr Ayoub said.
The Rantha Galli stream merges into the roaring Jagran nullah after one or so kilometres away from the site of the tragedy and after seven kilometres from there the Jagran nullah merges into Neelum River in the town of Kundal Shahi.
Mr Ayoub feared that the girl’s body might have been flown by Jagran nullah into the swollen Neelum River.
He said as a result of heavy rains, almost all water channels in most parts of the valley had flooded, posing serious risks to the adjacent properties and inhabitants. 
In the other incident, a 60 years old man, identified as Mir Abdullah, drowned in a water channel in Lawat village when he was returning home from a mosque after Maghrib prayers. 
The man slipped in the mud and fell into the stream. Though fellow villagers pulled him out of the channel in a short while but did not survive, Mr Ayoub said. 
Unrelenting rains had also triggered landslides along the main Neelum valley road at several places, blocking traffic beyond Shaikh Bela, some151km northeast of here and 5km before the town of Kel, he said, adding that the highways department personnel were braving harsh weather to keep it open for traffic, he said.
In response to a question, Mr Ayoub said at least 15,000 tourists were still present in the valley and they had been advised not to leave their respective accommodations until the weather condition improved.
Meanwhile, the hoteliers and local residents in the valley had offered free accommodation and free meals to tourists who had run out of money due to prolonged stay in the area. 
In Muzaffarabad, Saeed Qureshi, a senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn that four persons, identified as Mubashar Hussain, Zahida Bibi, Mehar Ali Shah and Noor Hussain, had sustained injuries in rain-related incidents in Patikka areas of district Muzaffarabad. In the same area, he said, three houses and a cattle pen were destroyed and as many houses were partially damaged by heavy rains.
Elsewhere, 11 houses were partially damaged in district Bagh and one house was partially damaged in district Jhelum Valley, he said.
Of the inter-provincial roads, Mr Qureshi said the Muzaffarabad-Islamabad road via Kohala was open for all kinds of traffic but the Muzaffarabad-Mansehra road via Lohar Galli was closed due to the huge landslide at Lohar Galli.
However, small vehicles were being diverted to the alternative route of Shaheed Galli to travel to Mansehra and beyond, he said.

The report was finalised by a committee headed by health authority CEO Dr Ejaz Ahmed Khan Galloo and consisting of Dr Kamran Zia Qureshi and Deputy District Health Officer Dr Safdar Malik.
According to the report (copy available with Dawn), Sabir Hussain was brought to the hospital’s emergency unit in a critical condition and the consultant prescribed an injection to save his life, but the hospital’s pharmacy refused to provide the vial. The patient was later referred to Rawalpindi. 
His attendant Qamar Shahzad raised the matter with the medical superintendent, but the lifesaving injection was not given to the patient despite being available in the hospital’s pharmacy. The inquiry was conducted on directives of the higher authorities.
According to the report, a junior pharmacy technician informed the patient’s attendant that the vial of Heparin injection was not available even though a half dose was present and could be given to the patient. 
The report also stated that the pharmacist failed to ensure the injection’s availability after only one vial remained in the store on March 31. Furthermore, the in-charge nurse tampered with the patient’s name in the emergency register while the head nurse failed to double check the records. It was also found that the cardiologist had not mentioned the patient’s name and age as well as the date and time on the prescription which was also against guidelines. 
Moreover, the hospital’s emergency director did not ensure that the emergency unit had sufficient stock of life-saving medications.
The inquiry committee sought disciplinary action against the hospital’s medical superintendent for lack of command and control and communication mismanagement. The report also recommended action against the other staffers and recommended warnings to the cardiologist, emergency director and chief nurse for their ‘minor mistakes’. —
