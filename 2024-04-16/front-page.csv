• Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud’s two-day visit to lay groundwork for MBS’ visit
• Negotiations to focus on energy, defence, IT sectors; Agreements to be signed during crown prince’s visit
ISLAMABAD: A Saudi delegation led by Foreign Minister Faisal Bin Farhan Al Saud arrived in Islamabad on Monday to lay the groundwork for the upcoming visit of the Saudi crown prince later this year and to kick-start formal negotiations on potential investment projects between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
Upon his arrival, the Saudi delegation — which is on a two-day visit — was welcomed by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar at the airport. During its stay, the delegation is scheduled to meet President Asif Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Foreign Minister Dar, Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir, and the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office highlighted that the visit aimed to “expedite follow-up on the understanding reached between Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif and Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and prime minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during their recent meeting in Makkah Al Mukarramah to enhance bilateral economic cooperation.”
During that meeting, the Saudi crown prince pledged to expedite the first tranche of a $5 billion investment in Pakistan. Overall, Saudi Arabia has committed to investing $25 billion in Pakistan over the next five years, focusing on energy, IT, minerals, defence, and agriculture sectors under the Special Investment Facilitation Council.
The Pakistani officials will present specific projects for potential investment to the visiting Saudi officials, who will assess their feasibility. “No MoUs will be signed during this visit. The agreements, once finalised, will be signed during the visit of Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman,” said a source.
“This visit is aimed at lending positive impetus to enhanced bilateral cooperation and a mutually rewarding economic partnership,” the FO said.
Particular interest has been shown in the Reko Diq gold and copper mines, with Barrick Gold Corp revealing last August that there might be involvement from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, given the Pakistan government’s 25 per cent equity in the project.
Further investment opportunities in the mining sector and some state-owned enterprises, which Pakistan is considering privatising, will also be proposed. According to a statement shared by state-run PTV, the delegation will consult on the next phase of investment and implementation.
The visit will also advance the achievement of the SIFC’s objectives and boost the economic recovery of Pakistan.
The Saudi FM is accompanied by a high-level delegation that includes Abdul Rahman Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadley, the minister of water and agriculture; Bandar Ibrahim AlKhorayef, the minister of industry and mineral resources; Badr AlBadr, deputy minister of investment; Mohammad Mazyed Al Towaijri, and other officials.

QUETTA / PESHAWAR: While the Balochistan government declared a rain and flood emergency in 25 districts, 18 more people were killed and several others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as the downpour continued to lash several parts of the province for the third consecutive day on Monday.
Lightning strikes and heavy rains have killed over 55 persons in KP, Balochistan and Punjab since Friday.
In KP, five persons were killed in Lower Dir, four in Khyber, two each in Swat and Dera Ismail Khan and one each in Manshera, Battagram, Mohmand, Charsadda and Bajaur districts on Monday. Most people died in roof collapse incidents following heavy rains accompanied by thunderstorms.
The continuous rains and floods also resulted in the closure of roads in several districts of the province.

Death toll in rain-related incidents rises to 55; more downpours expected until 21st

Heavy rains in the upper parts of the province also caused medium-to-high level flood in Kabul, Panjkora and Swat rivers.
The Met department has issued a high flood warning for the areas of Nowshera district falling on the banks of Kabul river and its tributaries over the next 48 hours. It forecast more rains as a strong westerly wave is likely to enter the upper parts of the country on Tuesday night and said that it may result in rain/thunderstorms with occasional gaps from April 17 to 21 in several districts of the province.
On Monday, Upper and Lower Chitral district also received a rare heavy snowfall.

The Balochistan government on Monday declared a rain and urban flood emergency in at least 25 districts of the province which have been badly affected by heavy rains and thunderstorms, killing and injuring several people.
Leaves of staff in the public departments concerned have been cancelled for launching rescue operations and extending other services to the flood-stricken people in the affected districts.
“The education department has extended Eid holidays for another two days in the districts which are continuously receiving heavy rains,” Shahid Rind, a spokesman for the Balochistan government said at a press conference in Quetta.
He said a meeting presided over by Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti reviewed the prevailing situation following a new spell of heavy rains. Commissioners and PDMA officials attended the meeting online.
CM’s Principal Secretary Imran Zarkoon and the PDMA director general briefed the meeting on the overall situation that occurred due to heavy rains in the province.
CM Bugti expressed his annoyance over public complaints about the blocking of sewerage system and directed the field officers to take precautionary measures to deal with any emergency situation in the rain-affected areas.
Meanwhile, Quetta Division Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat, while speaking at a separate press conference along with PDMA Director General Jahanzeb Khan, said Quetta had received 156mm rain over the last three days.

He said that over 200 employees of the departments concerned are being sacked for negligence in performing their duties during heavy rains. He said the main reason for rain damage was encroachment on 82 nullahs in and around the provincial capital that blocked the flow of rain water coming from roads and human settlements.
“The rain nullahs were 40 feet wide when constructed, but now they remained just 20 feet due to encroachment,” Mr Shafqaat said, adding that the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation and PDMA had launched an anti-encroachment drive to bring the size of these nullahs to their original size.
Routine life affected
Though the weather remained dry in Quetta and there was no rain on Monday, the overnight downpour ba­­dly affected the normal life as many downstream areas and roads of the city remained under floodwater.
The overnight rain flooded all main roads of Quetta and disrupted traffic causing difficulties to the people. The floodwater submerged even footpaths restricting the movement of pedestrians.
The entire city was presenting the view of a river as rain water accumulated due to blocking of the sewerage system and rain nullahs. Two to three feet of rainwater was flowing on main Jinnah Road, Kandahari Bazaar, Liaquat Road, Zarghoon Road and even in the red zone area.
Hanna Valley and Nawan Killi areas were badly affected as flash flood entered houses, damaging mud houses and washing away link roads.
Several mud houses were damaged and traffic affected in Panjgur, Dalbandin, Zhob, Sherani, Ziarat, Musakhail and Barkhan areas.
However, no human loss was repo­rted from any area of the province.
The Met Office said another spell of heavy rains accompanied by thunderstorms is expected from April 17 in Gwadar, Washuk, Kach, Panjgur and Chagai areas.
NDMA to coordinate with provinces
The prime minister expressing con­dolences for the lives lost, asked the National Disas­ter Management Au­­thority chairman to coordinate with provinces and provin­cial disaster management authorities to dispatch relief items to affected areas.

2,"Petrol price up by Rs4.53, diesel rises by Rs8.14",ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday increased the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel by Rs4.53 and Rs8.14 per...,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday increased the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel by Rs4.53 and Rs8.14 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight ending April 30.
In a late-night an­­nouncement, the Ministry of Finance stated since the prices of petroleum products had seen an increasing trend in the international market during the last fortnight, it decided to accordingly revise the existing consumer prices of petroleum products.
The ex-depot petrol price was thus increased from Rs289.41 to Rs293.94, up by 1.6pc (or Rs4.53 per litre), for the next fortnight. In the retail market, petrol would, however, be available for no less than Rs295 a litre.
Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.
On the other hand, the ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs8.14 per litre (2.9pc) to Rs290.38 per litre for next 15 days against Rs282.24 per litre over the past fortnight. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The government did not announce the prices of kerosene and light-diesel oil. Kerosene is mostly used by unscrupulous elements for mixing it with petrol and to some extent for lighting in very remote areas while LDO is consumed by flour mills and a couple of power plants.
Informed sources said the prices of petrol and HSD had increased in the international market by about $4 and $4.50 per barrel respectively in the last fortnight before the latest escalation.
Interestingly, the import premium on petrol has dropped by almost 21pc to $10.7 per barrel over the last fortnight when compared to $13.50 in last few days of March and the rupee strengthened by about 40 paisa, except on April 15 when it lost value against US dollar.
The HSD price, on the other hand, was up in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark PSO remained unchanged at $6.50 per barrel.
At retail stage, the HSD would be sold at about Rs292 per litre.
For the purpose of price calculations, officials said the price of petrol had gone up by about $4 per barrel to $98.5 last week from $94.5 earlier while HSD price went up by about $4.50 per barrel to $102.9 from $98.4.
On April 1, the government had increased the price of petrol by Rs9.66 per litre and reduced that of HSD by Rs3.32 per litre for the first fortnight of the month.

3,"Don’t need more policy prescriptions, says Finance Minister Aurangzeb",Seeks help with tackling climate change fallout on his first day in Washington.,"WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Monday that Pakistan doesn’t need too many policy prescriptions, it just needs to implement those policies.
Speaking at the Atlantic Council think tank on his first working day in Washington, the minister also urged institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help countries like Pakistan deal with the effects of climate change and achieve financial inclusivity.
The minister, who is in the US to attend the spring meetings of the World Bank group and discuss a new loan package with the IMF, stressed the need for promoting financial inclusiveness and climate resilience when asked to comment on the ongoing debate about reforming the two financial institutions.
The minister pointed out that Pakistan was not a major emitter, yet it was among the major victims of climate change. The country also needed financial inclusion to enhance the position of women in the national economy, he noted.

On his first day in Washington, finance minister seeks help with tackling climate change fallout

Mr Aurangzeb made it clear in the very beginning that during his almost week-long stay in Washington, he would seek a new programme from the IMF.
Responding to another question, he said Pakistan was looking for a larger and longer program from the IMF because “we need two to three years for structural reforms.”
He said he would like to conclude the formalities and get a new Extended Fund Facility (EFF) package from the IMF “as soon as we can, but these are just preliminary discussions”.
He said that during his negotiations with the Fund’s team in Islamabad, he learned that the IMF believed Pakistan had the capability, but it needed to carry out the reforms it pledged. “The PM is quite keen and vocal on the need for a new programme,” he added.
If the this week’s discussions are fruitful, Pakistan anticipates an IMF mission visiting Islamabad next month for further talks on the loan. Additionally, the delegation plans to negotiate increased financing with the World Bank.
Pakistan is also eagerly anticipating the release of $1.1bn under the current Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) expiring this month.
Talking about the need to expand the tax base and reform the system of tax collection, the minister said the reforms would not only increase the revenue but also bring transparency and improve the client experience.
He also emphasized the need to encourage public-private partnership, pointing out that the government couldn’t do everything.
Pakistan, he said, needed “timely decisions, timely execution” to build its economy as “no strategy works without execution.”
Asked how Pakistan could successfully rebuild its economy, the minister said: “We do not need too many policy prescriptions. We know what to do … it’s time for us to start moving”.
Business council
Earlier, the finance minister commenced his official engagements by meeting a delegation from the US-Pakistan Business Council. During the meeting, the minister highlighted the government’s dedication to attracting both foreign and domestic investments in key sectors, a press statement said. These sectors include agriculture, IT, mines & minerals, and energy.
He also met Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives and the current head of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.
“He highlighted Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change, the role played by the country in the establishment of Loss and Damages Fund and the way forward to address climate challenges in vulnerable countries,” said a statement issued by Mr Aurangzeb’s team.

4,Dharna commission suggests laws to regulate spy agencies,Recommends ‘zero tolerance’ for violent extremism; criticises past agreements with militant groups as ‘temporary fix’ that doesn’t,"ISLAMABAD: The Faizabad dharna commission, formed to investigate the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP) 2017 sit-in, has sent its report to the federal government recommending, among other things, legislation and drafting of rules and SOPs to regulate the working of intelligence agencies.
Sources told Dawn the report also noted that the involvement of the army or its affiliated agency in civilian matters adversely affects the fair image of the institution.
“Army is a sacred arm of the state, therefore to avoid criticism, the institution may not be involved in public matters. This task may be assigned to [the Intelligence Bureau] and civil administration,” it said.
The commission also advised against using the paramilitary FC and Rangers in the urban areas.

Recommends ‘zero tolerance’ for violent extremism; criticises past agreements with militant groups as ‘temporary fix’ that doesn’t work

The three-member body, headed by retired police officer Syed Akhtar Ali Shah and consisting of former IGP Islamabad Tahir Alam Khan and Additional Interior Secretary Khushal Khan, also called for “zero tolerance” towards violent extremism and suggested the government review its policies to address the root causes of the menace.
The commission was constituted under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 2017 to ensure compliance with the February 6, 2019, apex court verdict, authored by then-Justice Qazi Faez Isa.
The report said that the fallout from the Faizabad dharna was “more due to lack of courage of conviction of the leader handling the issue and in particular the government of Punjab”.
It recalled that while there was an agreement on the part of the government and official institutions to resolve the matter through negotiations and avoidance of the use of force. Initially, the federal government took the stance that the Punjab government should deal with the issue within its jurisdiction, but the government of Punjab maintained that since they had accepted 11 out of the 12 demands of the protesters.
Since the demonstrators’ final grievance pertained to the Centre, the provincial government argued that they should be allowed to proceed to Islamabad. The Punjab government reportedly assured the Centre that the demonstrators would peacefully disperse after registering their protest.
The commission also noted that since no one from among the then-PM, former ministers for law, interior and the former Punjab chief minister accused intelligence agencies of facilitating the protesters, nor was any evidence furnished to this effect, the commission could not connect any organisation or state official with the TLP dharna.
‘Dynamics of religious militancy’
The report also compared the agreement with the TLP with those signed with militant groups in the 2000s. “Without analysing the dynamics of religious militancy, government, as always, is only trying a quick fix rather than addressing the root cause and such a tendency has never worked in the past and will not work in the future … the inking of agreement on the terms of protesters and similar agreements in the past with other militant groups might have found a temporary solution to a deep-rooted problem,” the report said while calling for a review of approach in dealing with violent extremism. It also called for an effective system to curb terror financing.
According to the report, there should be coordination among law enforcement agencies, Pemra, and the interior ministry to surveil social media against “injurious material in violation of law”.
The commission also observed omissions in implementing the National Action Plan and sought to “strengthen the anti-terror agencies through basic reforms in the criminal justice system”.
It also called for action against those involved in terrorism and other crimes during the 21-day sit-in and said that cases “may be re-opened and investigated and taken to a logical conclusion”.
The report also noted that the Mustafa Impex case ruling, which diluted the executive authority of the PM, may be revisited.
The Islamabad Capital Territory may be given the status of a province with full administrative and financial authority and the Police Order 2002 may be implemented in the capital, it added.

5,‘Evidence of Indian role in attack on Sarabjit’s killer’,Interior minister says definite conclusion to be reached after probe; calls Bahawalnagar incident ‘fight between brothers’,"

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi addresses a presser at the FIA office, on Monday.—Murtaza Ali / White Star

 
LAHORE: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday said evidence has pointed towards India’s involvement in the attack on Amir Sarfraz Tamba, who was shot inside his house a day ago.
Addressing a press conference at the FIA office, the minister said the attack followed a similar pattern of assassinations in the past, which Pakistani officials claimed were carried out by India.
Tamba was one of the two men who had allegedly attacked Indian inmate Sarabjit Singh inside Kot Lakhpat prison in 2013.
Singh, who was awarded death sentence for involvement in a series of bomb attacks in Lahore and Faisalabad in 1990, died in a hospital a few days later.

Interior minister says definite conclusion to be reached after probe; calls Bahawalnagar incident ‘fight between brothers’

“India was directly involved in a few murder incidents here in the past,” the minister said, adding that an investigation was ongoing, but for now, “the doubt is that India was involved”.
“At this time, all evidence is pointing towards them (India),” Mr Naqvi said but added that any definite conclusion at this moment would be premature.
The attack on Tamba came days after the UK newspaper Guardian reported that the Indian government assassinated individuals in Pakistan as part of a wider strategy to eliminate “terrorists” living on foreign soil.
Due to the attack’s significance, the Punjab government has referred the case to the police’s Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment Punjab for investigation.
‘Fight between brothers’
The minister was asked about last week’s incident in Bahawalnagar, where police and army personnel came face to face following the arrest of a serving officer.
Mr Naqvi rejected the claims that Punjab Police was demoralised after the attack.
“This isn’t something [on the basis of which] we should say that the entire force has lost morale,” the minister said, adding that an investigation was underway to ascertain facts.
He said the incident was akin to a “fight between brothers at home” and added that, in his view, it “shouldn’t have been such a big issue”.
Mr Naqvi claimed that a similar incident had happened in India, but “it didn’t become a very big issue”.
On rising street crimes in Karachi, the interior minister said he was in contact with the Sindh police chief and the force was “aggressively working” to control the issue, APP added.
Mr Naqvi, whose ministry also oversees immigration at airports, said steps were being taken to increase the number of counters at Lahore Airport to process the passengers faster.
He said the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Federal Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif have been contacted in this regard.
He also said that the FIA’s Cybercrime Wing was being revamped, and the vacant posts in the investigation agency would be filled on priority.
Earlier, Mr Naqvi inaugurated a new investigation block in the FIA office, named after Shahzad Younis, an officer who was killed in an attack on the building in 2009.
The officer’s widow, Sub Inspector Faiza Shahzad, FIA Director General Ahmad Ishaque Jehangir, FIA Lahore Director Sarfraz Virk and other officers were also present on the occasion.
The interior minister paid tribute to the martyred officer and also visited different sections of the newly inaugurated investigation block.
