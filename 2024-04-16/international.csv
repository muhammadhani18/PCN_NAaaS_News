0,Harry loses bid to appeal UK security ruling,The High Court ruled in February that the UK government had acted lawfully.,"LONDON: Prince Harry will not be allowed to appeal the downgrading of his personal security when he visits Britain, a court ruled on Monday.
The youngest son of King Charles III took legal action after the British government told him in 2020 that he would no longer be given the  “same degree” of publicly-funded protection when he is in the UK.
The High Court ruled in February that the UK government had acted lawfully.
High Court judge Peter Lane said in a 52-page judgement that the  “bespoke process” devised for him by a committee which is under the remit of the interior ministry  “was, and is, legally sound”.
A legal spokesman for Harry said at the time that he would try to turn to the Court of Appeal  “to obtain justice”. A judicial spokesperson, however, said that Harry had lost his initial bid to appeal against the decision.
The prince, also known as the Duke of Sussex, sensationally relocated to North America in 2020 with his wife Meghan, eventually settling in California in the United States, and is no longer classified as a working royal.
Harry told a hearing at London’s High Court in December that security concerns were preventing visits back to Britain.
“The UK is my home. The UK is central to the heritage of my children,” he said in a written statement read out by his lawyers. “That cannot happen if it’s not possible to keep them safe.
“I cannot put my wife in danger like that and, given my experiences in life, I am reluctant to unnecessarily put myself in harm’s way too.” Harry’s mother Princess Diana was killed in a high-speed car crash in Paris in 1997 as she tried to escape paparazzi photographers.

1,"Singapore PM to step down, deputy to take over on May 15","Political analyst says deputy Lawrence Wong ""brings a style of leadership that’s more attuned to a different generation"".","SINGAPORE: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will step down next month and his deputy Lawrence Wong will take over, the second non-member of the Lee family to lead the wealthy nation.
“I will relinquish my role as Prime Minister on 15 May 2024 and DPM (Deputy Prime Minister) Lawrence Wong will be sworn in as the next Prime Minister on the same day,” Lee said on social media on Monday.
“I ask all Singaporeans to give Lawrence and his team your full support, and work with them to create a brighter future for Singapore.” Wong, who is also the finance minister, was chosen as Lee’s heir-apparent in 2022 from a new generation of lawmakers from the People’s Action Party (PAP) which has ruled uninterrupted since independence in 1965.
“I accept this responsibility with humility and a deep sense of duty. I pledge to give you my all in this undertaking,” Wong said on social media. The 51-year-old, US-educated economist is widely seen as a social media-savvy stalwart who effectively handled the Covid-19 crisis when he oversaw the government’s pandemic taskforce.
The city-state was one of the first in Asia to quickly get back in the saddle as the pandemic eased in 2022, with business and tourism numbers picking up.
Mustafa Izzuddin, a political analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said Wong was already well known in Southeast Asia and to the two major powers most important to the city-state, China and the United States.
“I think he brings a style of leadership that’s more attuned to a different generation. I think the core principle of what Singapore is about will remain because it is a system that has worked for many years,” he said.
“But I think his style may be maybe slightly different because he comes from a different generation.” Outgoing Premier Lee’s father, Lee Kuan Yew, was Singapore’s first prime minister when it became a sovereign nation after a brief, unsuccessful union with Malaysia.

2,"Frozen Russian assets on agenda in IMF, WB talks",Plan afoot to unlock value of immobilised assets to support Ukraine’s reconstruction,"WASHINGTON: The gathering of world leaders at the IMF and World Bank’s spring meetings brings an  “opportunity” for progress in tapping immobilised Russian assets to aid Ukraine, a senior US Treasury official said on Monday.
Leaders including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will represent the United States at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank talks this week in Washington — covering issues including the impact of Iran’s recent attack on Israel.
In particular, conversations are set to  “include ways to unlock the value of immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s continued resistance and long-term reconstruction,” the Treasury official told reporters.
The comments come on the back of mounting calls in Washington and Europe to set up a fund for Ukraine using billions of dollars in Russia bank accounts, investments and other assets frozen by the West over Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor in 2022.

Plan afoot to unlock value of immobilised assets to support Ukraine’s reconstruction

On Monday, the Treasury official also told reporters:  “I want to condemn in the strongest possible terms Iran’s attack on Israel over the weekend.” Calling Iran and proxies a  “destabilising force” in the Middle East, the official added that recent events are due to be a significant topic of conversation in meetings while President Joe Biden leads an international response.
On Wednesday, Yellen will have a meeting with counterparts from Japan and South Korea to coordinate on issues ranging from sanctions to secure supply chains, according to the Treasury.
Yellen will also stay focused on managing US relations with China, following her recent travel to the country where she raised concerns on its excess industrial capacity.
“We hope to make further headway on our shared work on sustainable finance,” the Treasury official said.
The Treasury Department is set to host a fourth meeting of the US-China economic and financial working groups this week as well.
The aim is to start exchanging more detailed data and try to make progress on issues like balanced economic growth — including the issue of overcapacity.
Asset swap scheme
The  Russian broker organising a frozen asset swap scheme that could free up  stranded funds for Russian and non-resident investors has seen tens of  billions of roubles of demand from foreigners including US banks and  funds, it said on Monday.
Moscow presents the plan as a way for  both Russian and foreign investors to free up assets that have been  blocked by Western sanctions and Russian counter-measures since the  start of the conflict in Ukraine more than two years ago.
There  has been strong demand from Russian retail investors, Alexei Yakovlev,  director of the finance ministry’s financial policy department, said  earlier this month. Retail investors wishing to participate have until  May 8 to submit offers.
Voronezh-based broker Investitsionnaya Palata (Investment Chamber) was appointed by the finance ministry to run the scheme.

3,Judge finds staffer committed rape in Australian parliament,Judge throws out a defamation suit brought by Bruce Lehrmann against TV channel for airing victim's interview.,"SYDNEY: An Australian judge ruled on Monday that a conservative political staffer likely committed rape in parliament, a dramatic twist in a case that sparked national protests.
The judge threw out a defamation suit brought by the former staffer, Bruce Lehrmann, against Network 10 television after it broadcast an interview with his alleged victim, Brittany Higgins.
Federal Court Justice Michael Lee made his finding on the balance of probabilities, as required in civil cases. In a criminal case, a conviction must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. “Mr Lehrmann raped Ms Higgins. I hasten to stress; this is a finding on the balance of probabilities,” the judge said.
“Mr Lehrmann remains a man who has not been convicted of any offence, but he has now been found, by the civil standard of proof, to have engaged in a great wrong,” Lee said. Higgins has alleged that Lehrmann raped her on a couch inside the national parliamentary office of a government minister following a night of heavy drinking in March 2019. Lehrmann has stridently maintained his innocence and has not been convicted of any criminal offence.
A criminal case against him on a charge of sexual intercourse without consent collapsed in October 2022. A courtroom sheriff had discovered a jury member with an academic paper on sexual assault — a document prohibited by the trial’s strict rules.

4,Court extends Kejriwal’s detention until 23rd,NEW DELHI: A Delhi court extended on Monday the detention of opposition leader Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case until...,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court extended on Monday the detention of opposition leader Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case until April 23, legal news website Live Law reported, a setback to the opposition which needs him to campaign in general elections that begin this week.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED), India’s financial crime-fighting agency, arrested Kejriwal, the chief minister of the national capital territory of Delhi, in a corruption case related to the city’s liquor policy and he had been remanded to custody until April 15.
Kejriwal has challenged his arrest saying it is unlawful and in a separate hearing on Monday, the Supreme Court of India asked the ED to respond to the challenge in the week of April 29, after which it will hear the case.
Kejriwal is a fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and rejects the charges against him and other opposition leaders as politically motivated. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) deny the accusations and say law enforcement agencies operate independently.
Kejriwal’s March 21 arrest sparked protests in Delhi and in the northern state of Punjab governed by his decade-old Aam Aadmi Party, and also drew the attention of the United States and Germany.

5,"Coral reefs going through fourth ‘global bleaching event’, scientists say","WASHINGTON: Along coastlines from Australia to Kenya to Mexico, many of the world’s colourful coral reefs have...","WASHINGTON: Along coastlines from Australia to Kenya to Mexico, many of the world’s colourful coral reefs have turned a ghostly white in what scientists said on Monday amounted to the fourth global bleaching event in the last three decades.
Fifty-four countries and territories have experienced mass bleaching among their reefs since February last year as climate change warms the ocean’s surface waters, according to the US National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch, the world’s top coral reef monitoring body.
Bleaching is triggered by water temperature anomalies that cause corals to expel the colorful algae living in their tissues. Without the algae’s help in delivering nutrients to the coral, the corals cannot survive.
“More than 54 per cent of the reef areas in the global ocean are experiencing bleaching-level heat stress,” Coral Reef Watch coordinator Derek Manzello said.
Announcement of the latest global bleaching event was made jointly by NOAA and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), a global inter-governmental conservation partnership. For an event to be deemed global, significant bleaching must occur in all three ocean basins — the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian — within a 365-day period.
Like this year’s bleaching event, the last three _ in 1998, 2010 and 2014-2017 _ also coincided with an El Nino climate pattern, which typically ushers in warmer sea temperatures. Sea surface temperatures over the past year have smashed records that have been kept since 1979, as the effects of El Nino are compounded by climate change.
Corals are invertebrates that live in colonies. Their calcium carbonate secretions form hard and protective scaffolding that serves as a home to many colourful species of single-celled algae.
Scientists have expressed concern that many of the world’s reefs will not recover from the intense, prolonged heat stress.
“What is happening is new for us, and to science,” said marine ecologist Lorenzo Alvarez-Filip at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
“We cannot yet predict how severely stressed corals will do,” even if they survive immediate heat stress, Alvarez-Filip added.
Recurring bleaching events are upending earlier scientific models that forecast that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the world’s coral reefs could be lost when global warming reached 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. 
To date, the world has warmed by some 1.2 C. In a 2022 report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, experts determined that just 1.2 C of warming would be enough to severely impact coral reefs, “with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature”.  
This year’s global bleaching event adds further weight to concerns among scientists that corals are in grave danger.
“A realistic interpretation is that we have crossed the tipping point for coral reefs,” said ecologist David Obura, who heads Coastal Oceans Research and Development Indian Ocean East Africa from Mombasa, Kenya.
Coral reefs are estimated to provide some $2.7 trillion in goods and services every year _ with benefits such as attracting tourists, protecting coastal communities from storm surges, and supporting coastal fisheries, according to a 2020 valuation by ICRI’s scientific network.

Thanks to the stratospheric success of its generative tools that can create text, images and even video, OpenAI has become a leader in the artificial intelligence revolution and one of the most significant tech companies in the world.
The Japan office is the latest part of the Microsoft-backed firm’s international push, having already set up bases in London and Dublin. “We’re excited to be in Japan which has a rich history of people and technology coming together to do more,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
“We believe AI will accelerate work by empowering people to be more creative and productive, while also delivering broad value to current and new industries that have yet to be imagined.” 
OpenAI said its Japan office would bring it closer to enterprise clients — including global auto leader Toyota, tech conglomerate Rakuten and industrial giant Daikin — that are using its products  “to automate complex business processes”.
“We chose Tokyo as our first Asian office for its global leadership in technology, culture of service, and a community that embraces innovation,” the company added.

7,Iran says attack on Israel marks strategic shift,"TEHRAN: Iran’s missile and drone barrage against Israel was the first act of a tough new strategy, Tehran said on...","TEHRAN: Iran’s missile and drone barrage against Israel was the first act of a tough new strategy, Tehran said on Monday, warning Israel that any future attack would spark “a direct and punishing response”.
This spells a dramatic shift from past years in which Iran and Israel have fought a shadow war of proxy fights and covert operations across the Middle East and sometimes further afield.
Israel’s military claimed it had intercepted 99 per cent of the aerial threats with the help of the United States and other allies, and that the attack caused only minor damage.
Iran said it had dealt “heavy blows” to Israel and hailed the operation as “successful”.
“Iran’s victorious... operation means that the era of strategic patience is over,” the Iranian president’s political deputy, Mohammad Jamshidi, wrote on X.
“Now the equation has changed. Targeting Iranian personnel and assets by the regime will be met with a direct and punishing response.” 
President Ebrahim Raisi said the operation had “opened a new page” and “taught the Zionist enemy a lesson”.
Western governments denounced Iran’s retaliation as  “destabilising the region”.
Iran, however, insisted the attack was “limited” and urged Western nations to “appreciate (its) restraint” towards Israel, especially since the outbreak of the Gaza crisis on Oct 7.
‘A new equation’ 
Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has frequently called for Israel’s destruction and made support for the Palestinian cause a centrepiece of its foreign policy.
But it had refrained from directly striking Israel until Saturday, an attack on a scale which appeared to catch many in the international community by surprise.
For decades, Iran relied on a network of allied groups to exert its influence in the region and to deter Israel and the United States, according to experts.
A 2020 report by the Washington Institute said that Tehran had adopted a policy of “strategic patience”, which had “served it well since the inception of the Islamic republic in 1979”.
Former moderate president Hassan Rouhani was a staunch defender of the strategy, especially following Washington’s 2018 withdrawal from a landmark nuclear deal, advocating for Tehran not to take immediate countermeasures and taking a longer view.
Even after the 2020 US killing of Qasem Soleimani, an IRGC commander revered in Iran, Tehran gave prior warning to Washington, US sources said, before it launched missiles against two American bases in Iraq, and no soldiers were killed in the attack.
After Saturday’s attack on Israel, Guards chief Hossein Salami also said Iran was “creating a new equation”.
“Should the Zionist regime attack our interests, our assets, our personnel and citizens at any point, we will counterattack it from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he was quoted as saying by local media.
The attack was also hailed as a “historic” success by Iranian media, with a government-run newspaper saying the offensive “has created a new power equation in the region”.
The ultra-conservative daily Javan said the attack was  “an experience Iran needed, to know how to act in future battles” and that it would make Israel “think long before (committing) any crime” against Tehran.
The reformist Ham Mihan newspaper said the attack  “ended the status quo and broke the rules of the conflict that pitted the two sides against each other for 20 years and pushed the situation into another phase”.
“This is no longer a shadow war,” it said.

9,Female Olympian wants Kabul to be kept out of Paris games over Taliban’s rights record,Judoka Friba Rezayee feels whatever she did to support women’s rights has been undone by International Olympic Committee.,"GENEVA: Friba Rezayee, the first woman to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics, has been appalled by the treatment of women since the resurgence of the Taliban and is now campaigning for the country to be kept out of the Paris Games.
Rezayee, a judoka who competed at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, has called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban Afghanistan due to the Taliban’s human rights record. She has argued that under such a ban, Afghan women should still be allowed to participate as part of the IOC Refugee Olympic Team.
 
 

“Given tons and tons of evidence about the Taliban, about their brutal treatment of women and children, they are very dangerous,” Rezayee, who now lives in Vancouver, told Reuters. “If the IOC allows them to enter the Olympics at the heart of Europe, in Paris in 2024, it’s very dangerous for the people.”
Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the Taliban administration, declined to comment.

Judoka feels whatever she did to support women’s rights has been undone by International Olympic Committee

The Taliban — who say they respect women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law and local customs — have closed girls’ high schools and placed travel restrictions on women without a male guardian and restricted access to parks and gyms.
Asked to comment on Rezayee’s call, the IOC referred to a statement made last month by James Macleod, its Director of National Olympic Committee Relations and Olympic Solidarity.
Macleod said at the time that the IOC was in dialogue with Afghanistan’s National Olympic Committee (NOC) and sport authorities “with the aim to reverse the current restrictions on access to sport for women and young girls in Afghanistan.” He said that although the IOC acknowledged different views on whether Afghanistan’s NOC should be suspended, it “doesn’t believe that isolation of the Afghan sporting community at this time is the right approach.”
Separately, the IOC said that athletes needed a refugee status confirmed by the United Nations refugee agency to be eligible for the IOC Refugee Olympic Team.
‘Stronger than men with guns’
Rezayee was 18 when she stepped onto the mat in Athens in a historic moment for her country. She was convinced her pioneering role would help advance women’s rights. “I actually believed that we would only progress from here,” she said.
“When I returned from Athens, I stayed in Afghanistan and I wanted to stay in Afghanistan. I continued my training because I saw the important changes it was making in every single girl’s life.” But her hopes of seeing her countrywomen gain more rights were crushed when the Taliban seized power in August 2021.
 
 

“It feels like whatever I did to support women’s rights and gender equality back in 2004, it has been all undone by the IOC and by the Taliban and people who tolerate the Taliban,” Rezayee said.
In February, a UN expert described the Taliban’s disrespect for the rights of women and girls as “unparalleled in the world,” and said their takeover had “exacerbated a high prevalence of gender-based violence against women and girls.”
The IOC suspended Afghanistan’s NOC in 1999.

10,"Israeli forces, settlers kill three Palestinians in occupied West Bank","RAMALLAH: Armed Israeli settlers shot dead two Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Monday, hours after Israeli...","RAMALLAH: Armed Israeli settlers shot dead two Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Monday, hours after Israeli forces killed a Palestinian teen during a military raid, officials said.
Monday’s violence brought to eight the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or armed settlers since Friday, as Palestinian authorities reported increased settler rampages across the occupied West Bank.
Salah Bani Jaber, mayor of Aqraba, a town near the northern city of Nablus, witnessed Monday’s settler attack. He said some 50 settlers, many of them armed, attacked members of his community and fired at Palestinian youth, killing two of them and wounding others.
“There were Israeli soldiers at the scene who stood idly by watching the settlers,” he said.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said soldiers blocked its ambulances from reaching the area and tending to the wounded.
The Israeli military said it was looking into the incident.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli forces entered Nablus, killing 17-year-old Yazan Ishtayeh and wounding three other people, the Palestinian health ministry said.
Over the weekend, hundreds of armed Jewish settlers raided Palestinian villages near the city of Ramallah, blocking roads, setting houses and cars ablaze, and firing at civilians, medics and civilians said.
Israeli authorities said the escalation began after a 14-year-old Israeli went missing in the West Bank. His body was discovered on Saturday.
The US State Department condemned the killing of the Israeli teen and also said it was increasingly concerned by violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
In one incident caught on video and published by Israeli rights group Yesh Din on Sunday, a group of masked settlers appeared to set fire to a car in a West Bank town under the watch of three Israeli soldiers.
In response to the video, the Israeli military said: “The behaviour of the soldiers in the video does not correspond to the values and orders of the army. The incident is being examined and the soldiers will be dealt with accordingly.”  Violence in the occupied West Bank was already on the rise before the Gaza crisis unfolded on Oct 7. It has escalated since, with stepped-up Israeli military raids and  settler violence. In addition to more than 33,000 Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza, the Palestinian health ministry says 466 people in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli forces.
Palestinians have long aimed to establish an independent state in the territories Israel occupied in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Most countries view Israeli settlements on occupied land as illegal, a view that Israel disputes.
