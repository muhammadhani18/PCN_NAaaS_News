0,Dollar gains belie hopes for higher inflows,State Bank reserves see a slight decline.,"KARACHI: Despite mounting optimism for increased inflows and a new IMF bailout package, the US dollar strengthened in the inter-bank market while the State Bank’s reserves saw a slight decline.
A financial team led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is currently in Washington seeking another loan package from the International Monetary Fund.
Despite the minister’s hopeful outlook before departing for the negotiations, the market remained indifferent to these developments. On Monday, the dollar appreciated by 18 paise to Rs278.12. The greenback saw a 29-paisa increase in the open market, reaching Rs279.66.
Currency experts assert that the market is driven by tangible realities, emphasising that only actual dollar inflows can sway market sentiments; good news is not enough.

State Bank reserves see a slight decline

There is a pervasive sense of disillusionment in the currency market regarding the country’s increasing foreign debt and debt servicing burden. Experts see little prospect of escaping the substantial debt servicing obligations consuming a significant portion of Pakistan’s export earnings.
A senior banker remarked that avoiding the $25 billion debt servicing in FY25 appears impossible, especially with the necessity for further borrowings to meet financial obligations.
Last week, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) disbursed $1 billion against maturing Eurobonds, depleting the central bank’s already modest reserves.
Although the State Bank on Monday reported a marginal decrease of $0.1 million to $8.040bn in its foreign exchange reserves during the week ended on April 5, this figure did not account for the $1bn Eurobond payment. Currency experts estimate the actual reserves post-payment to be around $7bn.
Nevertheless, the SBP intends to bolster reserves by purchasing dollars from the inter-bank market, as it has been doing to maintain reserves at a targeted level of $9bn by the end of this fiscal year under the IMF Standby Arrangement.
As a high-level Saudi delegation is currently in Pakistan, Islamabad is pinning hopes on investment from the kingdom, which is interested in injecting $5bn across various sectors in Pakistan.
March witnessed a notable influx of $3bn in remittances and over $82m in treasury bills, marking a significant uptick after four years. However, bankers caution that this trend in T-bill inflows may not persist due to declining returns.
The current return rate on T-bills stands at approximately 21 per cent, a level considered high, and stable exchange rates over the past three months have encouraged investors to enter the market.
The State Bank reported the country’s total reserves stood at $13.441bn, including $5.4bn held by commercial banks during the week ended on April 5.

ISLAMABAD: The 969-megawatt Neelum-Jhelum Hydro­power Project (NJHP), completed at an estimated approved cost of more than Rs510 billion, has been partially closed once again within days of its full capacity utilisation after almost 20-month-long repair works.
The project was closed in July 2022 due to major cracks in its 3.5km tailrace tunnel (TRT), which was repaired over the next 13 months. Power generation started again in August-September 2023, attaining its maximum 969MW capacity on March 29, as announced by the Water & Power Development Authority (Wapda).
Within a week, on April 3, the 48km-long headrace tunnel (HRT) dropped pressure, and power generation fell to about 400MW “soon after the project was restored to full capacity by international contractors because of debris or cracks in HRT”, inside sources told Dawn.
They said the project authorities and contractors, in consultation with the Wapda management, tried in-house emergency measures to restore the project but the fault was bigger than anticipated, although generation had incre­ased since then.
 
 

An official said a remotely controlled vehicle would need to be arranged abroad, most probably from China, to trace and potentially address the fault, at an estimated cost of about Rs6bn. He said the prime minister had not yet been intimated about the incident. The partial project closure is resulting in a substantial daily loss of electricity units, he added.

Repair works may cost national kitty Rs6bn

The earlier repairs of 3.5km TRT cost the nation about Rs6bn, in addition to about Rs37bn in energy loss during repairs, maintenance, and testing over the following 20 months. Wapda has filed about Rs43bn insurance claims for the losses and is reported to have already held a series of high-level meetings on the subject.
When contacted, Wapda confirmed a significant reduction in power generation due to a fall in HRT pressure but remained evasive about its actual cause. “Electricity generation from Neelum-Jhelum Hydel Power Station has been restricted to 530MW due to decrease in headrace tunnel pressure on April 3,” it said in a statement, attributing this to being a “precautionary measure…to observe the behaviour of pressure fluctuation”.
The Wapda spokesperson said the generation from the power station would be increased gradually after analysis and deliberations with the project consultants.
It is important to note that all possible maintenance has been carried out during the observation, he said, adding that this maintenance included cleaning of trash racks installed at the intake gates in the reservoir, flushing of all three de-sanders, flushing of pressure gauge installed at the powerhouse and inspection of the spiral cases of the generating units.
“The project has a tunnel system comprising 51.5km. It is prudent to observe and monitor such a vast network,” the statement said.
On March 29, Wapda announced that the Neelum-Jhelum project had achieved its maximum generation capacity of 969MW. Following the resumption of its operation in early March after inspection of the TRT, the project is continuously in operation as per the availability of water and contributing electricity to the national grid.
It had said that taking advantage of the low-flow season, operation of Neelum-Jhelum project was stopped on Jan 10 for inspection of the rehabilitated tail race tunnel. Subsequently, the detailed inspection was successfully carried out prior to resumption of generation from the project“ early last month. Most importantly, International Panel of Experts also inspected the tail race tunnel, it added.
Since its commissioning in 2018, the project has generated 19.829 billion units of electricity, while 1.54bn units have been generated since the resumption of electricity generation after the rehabilitation of TRT in August last year.

2,"Debt and climate back on IMF, WB spring meetings’ agenda","The World Bank “cannot tackle poverty without the broader view"", says head Ajay Banga.","WASHINGTON: The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are due to open on Tuesday, with two clear objectives: help countries combat climate change and assist the most indebted nations.
The meetings — which will bring central bankers, finance and development ministers, academics, and representatives from the private sector and civil society together to discuss the state of the global economy — will kick off with the IMF’s publication of its updated World Economic Outlook.
Even as they look ahead, the meetings will have an air of nostalgia this year, as 2024 marks the 80th anniversary of both institutions.
They were born of the Bretton Woods conference, held in 1944 as allied nations sought to regulate the international financial order after World War II, which was then still raging.
At the time the financial challenges were huge, with great swathes of Asia and Europe needing to be rebuilt.
In many ways, the problems now are no less daunting, particularly as the World Bank and IMF — which just reappointed its managing director Kristalina Georgieva to a second five-year term — seek a path forward on climate change.
“There’s the climate crisis, debt, food insecurity, pandemics, fragility, and there is clearly a need to accelerate access to clean air, water and energy,” World Bank head Ajay Banga said during a recent live-streamed press conference.
The Bank “cannot tackle poverty without the broader view,” he said, adding that it is taking steps to widen its scope in order to help “create a world free from poverty on a livable planet.” Providing financing as countries make the transition to a low-carbon energy future and prepare for the impact of global warming remains a central focus.
 
 

Trillions of dollars are needed in this area, and both the IMF and WB are clear: they will never be able to cover all the resources required.
But it’s not just a question of resources, as Rachel Kyte, a professor specializing in climate policy at Oxford University, pointed out on Wednesday.
“We need to see much more radical collaboration” between the IMF, WB and regional development banks at the country level, she said.
Doing so will call for “streamlining procedures and processes”.
Debt, another major challenge
And then there’s debt, with the money owed by emerging countries once again at the heart of the discussions.
Negotiations between creditors and indebted countries have stalled in a number of cases, further delaying the implementation of IMF aid plans and the release of funds.
“The basic problem is that the Chinese don’t necessarily agree among themselves on how to proceed. And they don’t have a clear picture of what they have lent and to whom, given the multiplicity of players involved,” a source close to the matter told AFP.
This issue will be a particular focus of Wednesday’s meeting of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, which brings together financial institutions, representatives of the main bilateral and private creditors, and indebted countries.
The urgency has been underscored by the effect that interest rate hikes by the central banks of major economies, such as the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, have had on debt.
Central bankers have sought to combat post-pandemic inflation with the hikes, but in doing so have sharply increased debt costs for borrowing countries.
And while the first cuts are expected this year, rates are likely to remain higher over the long term than they have been over the last decade, according to all concerned.
That presents an additional challenge for governments that can spend more than a third of their income just to pay the interest on their debt.
“The inflation news is not good news for the developing world, and it’s especially problematic for a lot of countries that face rollovers on their eurobonds that are coming due in 2024,” said Clemence Landers, a researcher at the Center for Global Development, during a Thursday press call.
“In the absence of easing global financing conditions, these EuroBond rollovers are going to be a big problem.”

3,Boosting exports must for economic stability: Privatisation Minister Aleem,"Asks business community and investors to take measures, especially in view of Pak-Saudi investment.","KARACHI: As a high-level Saudi trade delegation arrived on Monday, Privatisation Minister Abdul Aleem Khan has asked the business community and investors to take measures, especially in view of Pak-Saudi investment and export agreements.
While presiding over an important meeting of the business community and investors at Sindh Governor House, he said an increase in exports was imperative for enhancing foreign reserves and stabilising the national economy.
He urged the private sector to explore new opportunities in different fields. “We have to further expand by investing in export sectors, which will ultimately create more jobs.” He urged the private sector to find new opportunities to invest domestically and abroad, and the government would provide all necessary facilities in this regard.
Welcoming the arrival of the Saudi business delegation, he hoped that the private sector would take full advantage of this opportunity, which would also boost trade between the two countries.
The Saudi delegation led by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al Saud arrived on Monday night for a two-day visit after a recent meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in which the two agreed to expedite the planned $5 billion Saudi investment package for Pakistan.
Commerce Secretary Saleh Farooqui briefed the meeting on the present export situation. He said there was a broad scope in agriculture, textiles, information technology, pharmaceuticals, mobiles, sports equipment, minerals and other sectors.
Business people, investors and business community leaders attended the meeting, besides Trade Development Authority of Pakistan Chief Executive Zubair Motiwala.

4,Oil sheds 1pc after Iran attack,Eases concerns of a quickly intensifying conflict that could displace crude barrels.,"NEW YORK: Oil prices sank by about one per cent a barrel on Monday after Iran’s weekend attack on Israel proved to be less damaging than anticipated, easing concerns of a quickly intensifying conflict that could displace crude barrels.
Brent futures for June delivery fell 91 cents to $89.54 a barrel, a 1pc loss, by 1:17pm EDT (1717 GMT). US crude futures for May delivery fell 87 cents to $84.79 per barrel, a 1pc loss.
Oil benchmarks had risen on Friday in anticipation of Iran’s retaliatory assault, with prices soaring to their highest since October.
Israel’s interception of Iran’s attack, which involved more than 300 missiles and drones, calmed fears of a regional conflict affecting oil traffic through the Middle East. “The success of the Israeli defense implies that the geopolitical risk has pulled back considerably,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho bank.
Strong US retail sales data from the Commerce Department also hindered oil prices, Yawger added, by increasing the likelihood that  interest rates  in the world’s biggest economy would remain higher for longer and reduce demand for oil.

7,"Stocks scale new high above 70,500","FM's Washington visit and World Bank's spring meetings fuel a buying spree, contributing to PSX's bullish close."," 


KARACHI: After a long Eid break, the stock market extended its record-breaking spree to a fifth session on the prevailing bullish sentiments stemming from Saudi investment prospects, propelling the benchmark KSE 100 index to close at a new all-time high above 70,500 on Monday.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation attributed the market’s rally to speculations over the positive outcome of the visit by a Saudi delegation led by foreign minister to expedite the kingdom’s investment plans and bilateral trade.
He said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s departure for Washington for talks on a new Extended Fund Facility on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank’s spring meetings fuelled a buying spree, especially by foreign investors, contributing to the PSX’s bullish close.
The market opened the session on a negative note, but a geopolitical restraint triggered massive value-hunting by investors, taking the market back into green territory and recovering early losses.
Topline Securities Ltd said Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd rose 3.77pc and 1.48pc in the E&P sector amid growing expectations of progress on Saudi investment in the Reko Diq mining project during the delegation’s two-day visit.
Investors strategically reinforced their equity positions, engaging in value hunting, mainly targeting blue-chip stocks across the market. As a result, the E&P, power, and banking sectors made significant positive contributions, with Hub Power Company Ltd, OGDC, PPL and PSO collectively adding 325 points to the index.
On the flip side, MCB Bank, Systems Ltd and Engro Fertilisers Ltd saw profit-taking, wiping out 169 points.
As a result of a mixed session, the benchmark KSE 100 index touched an intraday low of 69,914.11, losing 400.61 points, and a high of 70,608.88, gaining 294.17 points. However, it closed at 70,544.58 points after rising by 229.86 points, or 0.33pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume surged 42.58pc to 555.21 million shares. The traded value also increased by 27.27pc to Rs21.98bn on a day-on-day basis.
