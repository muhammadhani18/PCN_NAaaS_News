0,Premature newborns weighing less than 1.5kg at risk of losing vision: expert,"Says issue can be fi xed through screening, surgery","RAWALPINDI: The majority of premature newborns weighing less than 1.5 kg are at a higher risk of developing retinal blood vessel disorganisation, which can result in visual issues, including lifelong blindness.
Every year, over 900,000 kids are delivered prematurely in the country, and 80pc of them have vision issues. 
The development of the baby’s eyes is one of the numerous challenges faced in those fi rst few vulnerable weeks by prematurely born babies that are born before 266 days, according to Dr Wajid Ali Khan, chief of medical services at Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital.
He said that the issue can be fi xed with screening and surgery to help prevent major vision issues in children in the future.
He explained that an infant’s eye development may be affected if delivered prematurely.

Says issue can be fi xed through screening, surgery

The retina’s blood vessels start to expand three months after conception and fi nish at the time of a normal birth. The smallest and sickest are most at risk of developing Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which is the primary cause of paediatric retinal blindness, he said.
This is because using extra oxygen to treat premature newborns in hospitals promotes aberrant vascular growth in the eyes, and research indicates that the rate of advanced retinopathy can be lowered by maintaining a lower oxygen saturation level.
He stressed that to ensure that their premature infant receives the ongoing care of an ophthalmologist due to their increased risk of developing amblyopia, eye misalignment, and the need for glasses to develop normal vision, parents should incorporate a vision screening into their schedule between the ages of six and twelve months.
Over 40 highly skilled eye surgeons, including some of the most experienced eye specialists in the paediatric department, work at Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi. With the hospital’s current expansion, the paediatric department can now care for more than 500 OPD newborns per day, he
informed.
According to Dr Wajid Ali Khan, the hospital has signed MoUs with the administrations of Benazir Bhutto, Combined Military, and Fuji Foundation hospitals.
Under these agreements, they will provide all medical services, including screening and surgery, for newborns born at these hospitals and transportation. 
He said that Al-Shifa is one of the few hospitals in the world and the only one in South Asian region with the most up-to-date equipment and trained medical professionals to treat newborns with Retinopathy of Prematurity.
Since March 2013, Al-Shifa has screened and treated newborns, focusing on those under seven months old. In the past ten years, the trust has successfully treated almost 15,000 babies. 
He asserted that as awareness rises, the number will inevitably rise, and he said that with the use of teleophthalmology, we are offering free consultation to all state-owned and private health facilities, including those located abroad.

Training Commission (NAVTTC) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) through which PSDF will impart training on behalf of NAVTTC among the youth across the country.
Speaking on the occasion, PSDF Chief Operating Offi cer Ali Akbar Bosan stressed the need to learn international practices and improve the local curriculum to global standards.
“There is a need to bridge the gap between the local and international curriculum so the country produces skilled manpower in accordance with international demand,” Mr Bosan said, adding that by doing so, the Pakistani workforce can place itself better in the international market.
NAVTCC Chairperson Gulmina Bilal Ahmad urged imposing the youth emergency. 
“There is a need to take targeted steps to stop failing the youth and make them useful and important to society.
There is also a need to focus more on Balochistan for churning out more and more training
there,” she said.
PSDF Board member Dr Ijaz Nabi observed that by signing the MoU with NAVTTC, the PSDF has now been moving towards its objective of creating a skill development institution.
He further suggested expanding the PSDF across the country and industries other than through government funding. 
By the virtue of MoU, the outreach of PSDF has now expanded across the country, previously limited to Punjab.
As per a statement, collaborative efforts would be made in digital training and certifi cations of locally trained youth so they could be placed in the international market easily.
“Both the organisations also agreed to conduct the sector studies and training need analysis (TNA) for local and international demand generation, other than the studies and impact evaluations of the skills training programmes. 
Both the organisations will collaborate in imparting skills training to the youth of the country through
training programmes in the construction, hospitality, and IT sectors.
These trainings will be imparted with a focus on at least 30 per cent of graduates getting employment,” it stated.
The training would be imparted in 16 districts across the country, including Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Rahim Yar Khan, Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Nowshera, Abbottabad, Quetta, Gilgit, and Muzaffarabad. 
Furthermore, both organisations have agreed to collaborate on curriculum upgrades.

3,Call to increase taxes on cigarettes instead of utilities,"“Prioritise public health over industry interests, recognising the health and economic burden of tobacco consumption,” policy paper recommends.","ISLAMABAD: While a study has found that absence of a clear strategy regarding tobacco industry resulted in a loss of Rs567 billion in the past seven years, health activists have demanded increase in taxes on cigarettes instead of utilities.
Indus Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) has exposed the staggering loss to the national exchequer in a policy paper titled ‘Rethinking Tobacco Taxation in Pakistan: A Call for Immediate Reforms’.
The study has quoted the revenue targets of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from the cigarette
industry and the tax collected in seven years.
The IBC has recommended the government to align the tobacco taxation policy with the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and safeguard it from the industry’s infl uence.
“Prioritise public health over industry interests, recognising the health and economic burden of tobacco consumption,” the policy paper recommended.
“Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cigarettes, a major source of tobacco taxation, has been manipulated by
powerful businesses to safeguard their interests at the expense of public health,” it said.
Meanwhile the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc) has suggested that the government prioritise increasing taxes on cigarettes to reduce the health cost burden and economic crisis.
Country Head of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids Malik Imran Ahmad stated that Pakistan faced a considerable challenge in combating the tobacco menace. He also presented statistics showing a high prevalence of tobacco use in the country, with 31.9 million adults (15 years and above) consuming tobacco products, accounting for about 19.7pc of the adult population.
He further added that tobacco-related illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes and heart diseases, contributed to over 160,000 deaths annually in Pakistan.
“These deaths not only affect individuals but also have broader impacts on families, communities and the healthcare system,” he said.
Sparc Programme Manager Dr Khalil Ahmad highlighted that low cigarette prices were the reason why
children and youth initiated smoking. He said smokingrelated illnesses and deaths incurred substantial economic costs, amounting to 1.6pc of Pakistan’s GDP each year.

5,"Heavy rain, strong winds lash Rawalpindi, Islamabad",Garrison city residents complain about garbage-littered streets after rain.,"• Garrison city residents complain about garbage-littered streets after rain
• CDA teams spend busy day de-watering low-lying areas
RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Heavy rain and with strong winds lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Saturday, disrupting energy supply and flooding low-lying areas of the cities.
Due to gusts, temporary shelters at mud houses and kiosks were flown away and garbage dumped by the roadside littered the streets in Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantt, exposing the efficiency of the civic bodies. According to residents, sanitary workers collected garbage from their houses and dumped it in overflowing dumpsters in their neighbourhoods and the windy weather dispersed this garbage from these bins onto the roads.
The rain started in the early hours of Friday and continued throughout Saturday intermittently due to a “strong westerly wave which is affecting most parts of the country and likely to persist in the upper parts till today.
On Saturday, the meteorological department recorded 19 millimetres of rain at Golra, 26mm at Zero Point, 28mm in Saidpur, 18mm in Bokra, and 6mm at the Airport in Islamabad. Chakala experienced 18mm and Shamsabad witnessed 21mm of rainfall.
According to a Met official, more rain and snowfall over the hills “is expected in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan, Islamabad, and the Potohar region. Cold and dry weather is likely elsewhere in the country”.
Wasa in Rawalpindi
In Rawalpindi, the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) deployed its machinery on major roads to drain out the rainwater. “We have already imposed a rain emergency in the city and in this regard, all the staff has been deployed in the low-lying areas, especially along Leh Nullah, to dewater the neighbourhoods,” said WASA spokesman Umer Farooq.
Meanwhile, Rawalpindi Commissioner Engineer Aamir Khattak cancelled the leaves of all officers and staff in light of the rain emergency. He chaired a meeting of the disaster management committee held at the commissioner’s office, which was attended by Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema, Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf, and other officers concerned.
Due to the expected flow of tourists in Murree as a result of snowy weather, the relevant deputy commissioner “should have a close liaison with Islamabad administration”, the commission said, adding that the entry and exit points of the newly-created district should also be monitored. He also directed Rescue 1122 to keep the early warning system functional to avoid any untoward situation.
Commissioner Aamir Khattak also visited different areas of the city to review the cleanliness situation. He visited the Committee Chowk Underpass, Waris Khan Circle Road, and the Committee Chowk dumping point. He directed the Saddar assistant commissioner to identify space for a separate transfer site in the urban union councils within the next three days to facilitate efficient garbage collection. “There is only one transfer station for garbage in the city which is the biggest obstacle in maintaining cleanliness,” he said, adding that separate transfer stations would reduce the transport cost and increase the efficiency of the civic agency. 
He further directed that an immediate summary be moved to increase the scope of the Rawalpindi Waste Management Committee (RWMC) besides the lack of machinery and resources so that it may not create any hindrance in the cleaning drive.
While reviewing the flow of rainwater on the Gawalmandi bridge, he directed timely measures for water drainage.
Meanwhile, a ‘Clean Punjab’ campaign which started on March 1 will continue till March 31. Under the campaign, garbage from open spaces, vegetable markets, markets, bus terminals, and graveyards will be removed. He said that for this campaign, a cleaning operation plan had been prepared in Rawalpindi and its tehsils.
He said that the streets and main roads should be cleaned through “manual and mechanical sweeping and washing” and should be destroyed in open plots and cemeteries. “Awareness camps will be set up at the UC level across Punjab. 
CDA spends busy day
According to a statement issued by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), its teams remained active in Islamabad and along with a timely response to the complaints regarding inundation in different areas of the city, the water accumulated on the highways was also cleared by the CDA.
The statement claimed that the helpline established by the administration made it possible to solve the complaints of water accumulation in a timely manner to facilitate the citizens.
Joint teams of the CDA, the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad, and the Islamabad Capital Territory were active in CDA’s sectoral areas, non-sectorial areas, including housing societies and other low-lying areas to drain water from low-lying areas, including houses, with dewatering pumps.
“It should be noted that in view of the rains, the holidays of the relevant staff have also been cancelled. Similarly, the duties of the respective staff have been distributed at different times while strict monitoring of low-lying areas is also being ensured,” it stated. Several flooded vehicles were also observed, parked by the roadside after the rainwater damaged the electrical wiring, bringing them to a standstill.
