0,Petroleum demand hits 5-month low,"Research house predicts challenges in IMF negotiations, oil market volatility","The demand for petroleum oil products has hit a five-month low at 1.12 million tonnes in February due to increased prices, sluggish industrial activities, the transition of agriculture tube wells from diesel to solar power, and the introduction of new local coal-based and nuclear power plants replacing furnace oil-run generation plants.
According to oil sales data compiled and reported by Arif Habib Limited, overall demand decreased by 8% to 1.12 million tonnes in February compared to the same month last year. Additionally, demand dropped by 19% compared to January 2024.
In the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of the current fiscal year 2023-24, the demand for oil products decreased by 13% to 10.18 million tonnes compared to 11.69 million tonnes in the same period last year.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Mohammad Awais Ashraf, Director of Akseer Research, highlighted that the upward trend in petroleum oil prices has squeezed people’s purchasing power, leading them to reduce their reliance on expensive products.
Additionally, an economic slowdown, exacerbated by sluggish industrial activities, also contributed to the decrease in demand for these products in the domestic economy.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the price of high-speed diesel increased by almost 3% to Rs288.39 per litre in February 2024 compared to Rs280.85 per litre in the same month of the previous year.
Similarly, the price of super petrol increased by 1.39% to Rs276.66 per litre in the month compared to Rs272.86 per litre in the corresponding month of the previous year.
Ashraf noted that the demand for petrol remained stagnant, falling by only 1% this February compared to the same month of the previous year. However, the notable increase in diesel price resulted in a 7% reduction in its demand compared to February 2023.
He noted that diesel is primarily used by farmers and industrialists. A considerable number of farmers have transitioned their tube wells to solar power systems from expensive diesel-based ones, facilitated by government and central bank initiatives to install cost-effective and environmentally friendly solar equipment.
Additionally, the reduced demand for diesel in agricultural practices in February can be attributed to the limited need for watering crops and minimal use of tractors in the fields during this period.
He mentioned that the use of diesel in industries also remained stagnant due to moderate industrial output in the country.

The senior research analyst observed a significant decline of 56% in furnace oil consumption in February compared to the same month of the previous year, following the commissioning of new local coal-based and nuclear power plants in Pakistan.
With the availability of better and low-cost power options, the government opted to phase out expensive furnace oil-based generation, thereby reducing the demand for costly fuels like furnace oil and diesel in the system.
The cost of furnace oil-based power production has risen to Rs35-36 per unit (fuel cost only) at present, compared to around Rs29 per unit approximately this time last year. Similarly, diesel-based generation now costs Rs45-46 per unit.
In contrast, local coal-based power costs Rs12 per unit, and nuclear power costs Rs1.33 per unit (fuel cost only) in the country.
He anticipates that the demand for petroleum oil products may remain stagnant, near current levels, in the remaining four months of the ongoing fiscal year 2023-24.
The full-year demand for the products in FY24 may decrease by 10-12% compared to the previous year, FY23.
He mentioned that industrial demand for petroleum products would likely remain sluggish, as the high-interest rate would continue to discourage businessmen from increasing industrial output.
Ashraf anticipated that the central bank would maintain its policy rate at the current level of 22% for the remaining four months of FY24. He suggested that the bank might make its first rate cut in September 2024, which contradicts the general consensus among financial experts that the bank would make the first cut in the rate in March or April 2024.
He noted that Pakistan is poised to enter a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme once the current $3 billion one ends in March-April 2024. The potentially challenging negotiations during that period with the leading lender team might hinder the central bank from cutting the rate in March-April 2024.
Furthermore, he highlighted that if oil prices rise in international markets due to a surge in global demand preceding a softening of interest rates in world markets or due to geopolitical tensions, the demand for petroleum products in Pakistan may further decline.

1,AGP objects to Rs15b lent to PIA without approval,"Finance ministry under scrutiny as auditors highlight oversight failures, call for accountability","The Auditor General for Pakistan has recommended holding individuals accountable for disbursing Rs15 billion to Pakistan International Airlines in the last fiscal year without first obtaining a business plan or government approvals for the fund release. Federal auditors have raised an audit objection against the Ministry of Finance during their examination of accounts for the fiscal year 2022-23, concluding in June of the previous year.

The audit objection highlights the ad-hoc approach taken by successive governments, including the caretaker setup, in tackling the deep-seated financial challenges encountered by Pakistan’s third-largest public sector loss-making entity in 2022. 

The Auditor General for Pakistan (AGP) department has raised the objection regarding the payment of Rs15 billion in interest on loans on behalf of PIA without a thorough analysis of borrowing and business plans for the fiscal year 2022-23.

Since 2018, the finance ministry has been making such payments, and if the audit extends to previous years, the total could approach nearly Rs100 billion. The decision to cover PIA’s interest costs was made in December 2017 by the then government. However, the finance ministry failed to obtain any approval from the federal cabinet subsequently.

According to the audit objection, “The payment of markup without an analysis of PIA’s borrowings and business plan represents a serious lapse in management.”

The audit recommends holding individuals accountable for disbursing grants without obtaining a business plan or formal government approval.

The auditors observed that the finance ministry paid interest on PIA’s borrowings without scrutinising the borrowed amount or the purpose for which the funds were acquired from various banks. Additionally, the finance ministry neglected to analyse the borrowing agreements and other financial documents with the banks.

Furthermore, the objections revealed that “no business plans for Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) were approved even after five years had passed”.

Despite significant support from the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the interim government failed to bring about any improvements in PIA’s affairs. The privatisation ministry had assured the SIFC of privatising PIA before the end of January.

The privatisation ministry also presented a partial plan for the debt restructuring of PIA, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) did not endorse last month. The IMF requested comprehensive details instead of solely focusing on the restructuring of commercial banks.

The federal auditors highlighted that before securing the Rs15 billion annual grants, PIA did not furnish “expenditure reduction details” to the finance ministry.

Read Cabinet okays PIA restructuring

However, finance ministry officials were of the view that auditing expenses was not within their purview. They stated that scrutinising expenses fell under the responsibility of the PIA board and the aviation ministry.

In response to the AGP, the finance ministry stated that the Economic Coordination Committee of the cabinet rectified a decision in April 2023 to increase the sovereign guarantees’ limit to Rs263 billion for PIA. However, the AGP did not accept this response.

The finance ministry asserted that it rigorously negotiated every loan facility obtained by PIA from banks. It said that the cost of PIA borrowings was only 1.45% higher than the prevailing Karachi Interbank Offered Rates (Kibor).

According to the financial advisors’ report as of September 2023, PIA’s equity had turned negative by Rs663 billion. Last month, the federal cabinet endorsed inviting interest from potential investors to purchase 51% to 100% of PIA’s shares.

The Ministry of Finance opposed transferring the Rs622 billion debt to the holding company and instead recommended retaining some portion of it within the core PIA.

Financial advisors have suggested transferring PIA’s liabilities of Rs622 billion as of September 2023 to the new holding company, along with its assets. These transferable liabilities include Rs268 billion in commercial bank debt as of September 2023.

There is a prevailing sentiment that the federal government picking up the commercial banks’ debt would not resolve the issues, stressing the necessity to directly tie any debt settlement with the proceeds from privatisation.

In order to expedite the privatisation of PIA, the interim government has engaged a financial advisor at a substantial fee without adhering to the international competitive bidding process. Last month, the Privatisation Commission’s budget was increased by 175%, or Rs2.2 billion, to compensate Ernst & Young, the financial advisor for PIA.

This significant budget increase allocates the majority of the $14.53 million or Rs4.3 billion payments to the financial advisors tasked with the privatisation of PIA and the restructuring of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York.
The financial advisor for PIA is set to receive a total of $6.9 million or Rs2 billion, with 95% or Rs1.9 billion disbursed during the current fiscal year.

Likewise, the financial advisor for the Roosevelt Hotel will receive a staggering $7.65 million or Rs2.2 billion, with 60% of this payment allocated for the current fiscal year. These payments represent some of the highest compensation amounts granted to financial advisors contracted by the Privatisation Commission.

2,Pakistan Single Window to take over WeBOC,Officials will meet regularly to remove hurdles in way of providing access to PSW,"The federal government has decided to transfer the Web-based One Custom (WeBOC) system of Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited (PRAL), which works under the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), to the Pakistan Single Window (PSW) under a restructuring and reforms drive.
They have reached a consensus on the procedure for transferring the WeBOC system to PSW. The PSW governing council has asked the FBR to ensure that PRAL cooperates with the single window and provides immediate access to the WeBOC system.
According to documents available with daily Express, FBR’s Member Information Technology Dr Ashfaq Ahmed Tunio has officially released a circular, which revealed that it had been decided to transfer WeBOC immediately to PSW.
It was agreed that PRAL, along with the development and business intelligence sources code, would provide user ID and password for full access to WeBOC.
It was also decided that the PSW chief executive officer, PRAL CEO and director general reforms and automation would cooperate with each other for the provision of WeBOC to PSW.

In addition, these officials will meet every week to assess and remove hurdles standing in the way of WeBOC transfer.
According to the documents, the application of WeBOC and the deployment of database will be the responsibility of PRAL. Apart from this, PRAL will provide all necessary support including the network and infrastructure, user support, MIS and operational support.
The documents further stated that to ensure software development, system analysis, design and quality, the officials posted at Karachi station would work under the PSW but they would remain on the payroll of PRAL.

3,Kaspersky reveals 30% rise in ransomware attacks,Spike is mirrored by 70% rise in number of victims targeted globally from 2022-2023,"The proliferation of targeted ransomware groups has surged, with these entities now notorious for attacking governments, specific high-profile organisations, or select groups within larger entities, said a press statement. Research conducted by Kaspersky experts reveals a 30% increase in the number of targeted ransomware groups globally from 2022 to 2023. According to the statement, this spike has been mirrored by a 70% rise in the number of victims of targeted ransomware attacks during the same period.
Much like conventional businesses, targeted ransomware groups recruit cybercriminals as employees to orchestrate extensive and sophisticated operations. Kaspersky researchers closely monitored approximately 60 targeted ransomware groups in 2023, up from about 46 groups in 2022. They uncovered incidents indicating collaboration between these groups, with some known for trading access points into corporate networks selling initial entry points to more advanced ransomware groups capable of executing more sophisticated attacks. Such collaborations streamline the process for cybercriminals, allowing them to bypass preliminary stages and proceed directly to network reconnaissance or infection, reads the statement.

According to the press release, in 2023, Kaspersky celebrated its seventh year as a vital contributor to the No More Ransom initiative. Its free decryption tools were downloaded over 360,000 times, facilitating data recovery for over two million ransomware victims. However, despite these efforts, global ransomware payments exceeded $1.1 billion in 2023, reaching an unprecedented high.
“Targeted ransomware groups are highly persistent and aggressively pursue extortion. They often resort to threats of publicising stolen data if ransom demands are not met. In certain cases, cybercriminals file GDPR or SEC complaints against victim organisations in specific regions for alleged data protection violations,” remarked Maher Yamout, Senior Security Researcher at Kaspersky.

Speaking at a meeting with members of the Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) on Saturday, the consul general announced that a delegation of Malaysian traders and businessmen would visit Hyderabad soon. He said although 45 MoUs had been signed between Pakistan and Malaysia, in the absence of government-level agreements Pakistani students had limited academic opportunities in the Far East nation.

He was of the view that various areas of Pakistan had immense tourism potential and ideal opportunities. He was surprised to note that despite having a rich coastline in Karachi, required attention was not given to it for tourism purposes.
He said he would talk to the Malaysian government to increase the import of Pakistani rice, adding that Pakistani exporters could use Malaysian ports for trade with other countries as a transit facility.
HCCI President Adeel Siddiqui said the Pakistani government was offering all sorts of guarantees but there was a big gap between the countries’ trade balance.

5,PSX remains buoyant on political stability,"KSE-100 index surges 2,510 points, or 4% WoW, settles at 65,325.69","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained buoyant during the outgoing week as the KSE-100 index climbed around 2,500 points, propelled by investor optimism about political stability caused by the initiation of the process of forming a new government.
Foreign investors continued to engage in stock buying and they further built their portfolio while Moody’s maintained Pakistan’s credit rating with a stable outlook.
These developments, along with a further decline in trade deficit, fall in inflation and world stocks at record highs, provided investors the enthusiasm required to push the market higher.
At the beginning of the week on Monday, the bourse spiked as investors were encouraged by the easing of political turmoil following the election of chief ministers of Sindh and Punjab provinces.
Next day, stocks came under selling pressure, triggered by political uncertainty owing to delay in calling the first National Assembly (NA) session after general elections in early February.
Bulls held their firm grip on Wednesday when bullish momentum returned, which helped the KSE-100 gain nearly 500 points. It came after Moody’s maintained a stable outlook on Pakistan’s credit rating.
As political clarity emerged on Thursday, the market extended its bullish run where investors resorted to hefty buying over the commencement of formal legislative proceedings, propelling the index higher by over 870 points. The market rallied again on Friday as uncertainty about the formation of a new government evaporated, which dispelled investor fears and helped the KSE-100 gain nearly 750 points.
Overall, the benchmark KSE-100 index rose 2,510 points, or 4% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 65,325.69.
JS Research analyst Shagufta Irshad, in her report, stated that the KSE-100 index gained 4% WoW as investors welcomed the initiation of the process of installing a new government.
Average volumes were up 24% during the outgoing week while foreign investors made net buying of $10.4 million. She pointed out that first sessions of NA and provincial assemblies were called during the week and the election for the prime minister and president would be held on March 3 and 9, respectively. It would be followed by Senate elections later in the month.
Moody’s maintained Pakistan’s credit rating at “Caa3” with a stable outlook but highlighted liquidity and external vulnerability challenges ahead.
On the macro front, February’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in at 23.1%, a 20-month low. As per Pakistan Bureau of Statistics’ data, the trade deficit was recorded at $1.7 billion for February 2024, with 8MFY24 deficit at $14.9 billion, down 30% year-on-year (YoY).
Besides, the State Bank’s foreign currency reserves slid to $7.9 billion. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed the February 2024 tax collection target by Rs33 billion, however, higher receipts in previous months enabled it to meet the 8MFY24 goal.
Meanwhile, the government announced an increase of Rs4 per litre in petrol prices while diesel prices were kept unchanged for a fortnight, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that the stock market continued its positive momentum during which it surged from 62,000 to 65,000 points, reflecting investor optimism amid the government formation process. With the swearing in of NA members and the impending election for the prime minister on Sunday, the PSX responded positively to expectations of political stability and the government formation.

On the economic front, the forex reserves decreased by $63 million to stand at $7.95 billion. Additionally, the FBR collected Rs681 billion during February against the target of Rs714 billion, showing a shortfall of Rs33 billion. Pakistani rupee closed at Rs279.19 against the US dollar with the appreciation of Rs0.17, or 0.06% WoW.
Foreign buying continued during the week under review, which stood at $10.5 million compared to net buying of $2.9 million in the previous week, AHL added.

6,IT experts stress on empowering women,"Highlight female workforce participation in driving productivity, exports","Information Technology experts have underscored the pivotal role of female workforce participation in accelerating Pakistan’s IT sector productivity and exports. With a significant share of the local population and exceptional talent in computer and technology fields, their inclusion is deemed essential for sector growth.
Jehan Ara, former president of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), highlighted the significance of women’s inclusion in the workforce for fostering smarter and faster growth. Highlighting their unique perspectives, she noted their ability to address a significant segment of women users and consumers in businesses. She mentioned that IT companies have recognised this importance, leading to a notable increase in the ratio of women in the industry, rising from 12% to over 22% within the last five years.
Maha Shahzad, Founder and CEO of Buscaro, underscored the increasing working opportunities for women in Pakistan, whether onsite or remotely. She highlighted the need for women to navigate challenges and barriers while balancing their careers and family responsibilities to achieve their goals. Shahzad expressed confidence in Pakistani women’s ability to excel in various fields and roles, including founding startups and securing investments, despite prevalent issues, challenges, and cultural mindsets.
During the Women Tech Quest 2024 event hosted by 10Pearls University, Zeeshan Aftab, Co-Founder and Managing Director of 10Pearls, reiterated the substantial contribution of female professionals in Pakistan’s IT sector. He highlighted their robust skill sets in areas such as design, coding, and quality assurance, among others. Aftab urged IT companies to adopt flexible work cultures, including remote and hybrid models, to better accommodate women in the workforce and ensure a balanced approach to gender diversity.

In conversation with The Express Tribune, Alpha Beta Core (ABC) Analyst Sarwat Khan said, “One in four roles in top-tier tech companies like GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft) is held by women, with 44% of leadership roles filled by women at Apple. Pakistan ranks among the bottom two countries on the gender gap index, which assesses disparities in economics, politics, education, and health, just above Afghanistan.
While Pakistan’s IT sector shows strong growth in recent years, sustaining this growth becomes questionable if we neglect to include half the population in the IT industry. Despite many programmes, funding, and grants supporting women-led ventures, we are far behind the global ratio of women’s inclusion in tech roles. It is increasingly important to create a pipeline of women in the tech workforce who can step into the next available senior roles.
To promote women’s inclusion in tech roles, it is vital to build skills and create opportunities at each layer of the organisation rather than solely celebrating the advancement of a few women into senior roles.”

7,Ejaz urges 9-cent energy rate for industries,Says industrial sector shouldn’t shoulder burden of subsidising other sectors,"Federal Minister of Commerce, Interior, Industries, Investments, and Overseas Pakistanis, Dr Gohar Ejaz, stressed the importance of maintaining energy prices at 9 cents per unit for industries to ensure the survival of Pakistan’s industrial sector.
In a recent statement, he emphasised the critical role of energy prices in sustaining industrial growth and competitiveness in Pakistan. The minister highlighted the necessity of providing industries with affordable power rates to support their operations and contribute to the country’s economic development.
Ejaz underscored the importance of maintaining energy prices at 9 cents per unit for industries, stating it is crucial for Pakistan’s industrial sector survival. He highlighted that industries shouldn’t shoulder the burden of subsidising other sectors, given their pivotal role in job creation, exports, and import substitution.

Addressing the dilemma of subsidising households versus creating employment opportunities, Ejaz stressed the need to prioritise industrial growth to stimulate economic prosperity. He unscored the importance of boosting exports and ensuring Pakistan’s manufacturing sector’s viability to meet ambitious targets in global markets, including China, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Africa, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.
Providing electricity at 9 cents per unit to industries aims to level the playing field for local industries and enhance their global competitiveness. The proposal has received approval from the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), underscoring the government’s dedication to supporting industrial growth.
Ejaz expressed optimism that the incoming government would address the issue, enabling industries to operate more efficiently and make significant contributions to Pakistan’s economic prosperity.

In a letter written to the commerce minister, the members of the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association said molasses is a major byproduct of the sugar industry and its annual production is almost half of the total quantity of sugar produced in the country, said the millers.

9,Govt to divert Rs10b from provincial projects,Will pour funds into digital information infrastructure,"The federal government has decided to divert funds worth Rs10 billion from provincial projects for their injection into the Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative.
The decision was made as the Planning Commission opposed the diversion of funds from development to non-development projects.
In a recent meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), the Planning Commission argued that the National Economic Council (NEC), in its meeting held on June 6, 2023, had approved guidelines that restricted the diversion of development funds to non-development expenses during the current fiscal year.
The commission was of the view that the demand for Rs10 billion was for “recurring-nature expenditure”, which should be provided by the Finance Division from the current budget through a technical supplementary grant.
In the case of supplementary grant, the size of Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) 2023-24 would be further reduced, thereby adversely affecting public investment. Hence, the transfer of funds from the development to non-development budget was not supported, in principle, by the ministry, the commission said.
However, it said that because of the immediate requirement, the Finance Division may consider surrendering Rs10 billion from the allocation for provincial projects under the development grant. The amount may be recouped by the division in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year.
The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication briefed the meeting that Pakistan’s information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure was a key component of the cyberspace and was prone to cyber-attacks.
“Implementation of the initiative is crucial to mitigate the challenges posed by cyber-attacks by protecting the critical national information infrastructure,” it said. The Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative is aimed at providing technical capabilities to proactively identify potential cyber threats besides blocking cyber-security incidents/ breaches in real time.
On the directive of the Prime Minister’s Office to firm up implementation modalities, several consultative sessions were held among the stakeholders, where it was agreed that the IT ministry would act as a coordinating ministry while the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the relevant law enforcement agencies (LEAs) would be the implementing agencies for the initiative.

Read ECC okays Rs10b for Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative
It was also agreed that owing to the sensitivity of the initiative, LEAs would serve as the procuring agency. Various options for funding the initiative were also discussed.
It was recalled that a summary had been sent to the ECC by the IT ministry in November 2023. The ECC approved Rs5 billion in bridge financing from the Research and Development (R&D) Fund, which would be recouped by the Finance Division in the last quarter of FY24.
The federal cabinet ratified the decision in its meeting on November 15, 2023. The said funding had already been utilised by LEAs/ procuring agency for making advance payments for the initiative.
The procuring agency pointed out that the first installment of Rs10 billion for the initiative was due by February 15, 2024. In order to make funds available for installments, it was proposed that the planning ministry may identify financing sources from the FY24 PSDP.
The ECC considered a summary submitted by the IT ministry titled “Allocation of Rs10 billion through technical supplementary grant during CFY for the Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative” and approved the proposal.
It said that as proposed by the Ministry of Planning and Development, the technical supplementary grant should be arranged through surrendering Rs10 billion from the allocation for provincial projects under the development grant for FY24.
