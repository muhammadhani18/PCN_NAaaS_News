• Party terms protest ‘successful’, claims several leaders, workers rounded up
LAHORE / ISLAM­ABAD: PTI leaders and workers came face to face with the police once again on Saturday as the party staged protests across the country, despite inclement weather, against the alle­ged rigging in the February 8 general elections.
Police in Punjab thras­hed and arrested several workers and leaders in Lahore and other cities. PTI claimed that around 80 protesters were arres­ted from Lahore alone.
Protests were held in 38 cities of Punjab on Saturday. In Lahore, the protesters at GPO Chowk and Liberty Chowk were greeted by a heavy contingent of police.
PTI leaders and workers who gathered at GPO Chowk chanted the slogans, but as leaders tried to address the crowd, they were stopped and arrested by police.
PTI leaders Mian Shahzad Farooq and Afzaal Azeem Pahat, who contested the election last month against Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif, respectively, were also arrested.
Former Supreme Court Bar Secretary Aftab Bajwa and several party workers were arrested from GPO Chowk, as well as Liberty Roundabout in Lahore.
The protesters vowed to continue their struggle to get their due mandate back and said the incumbent government could not silence them by registering “fake FIRs”.
They said it was their right to hold peaceful protests.
PTI leader Zubair Khan Niazi, who has been in hiding since May 9, appeared at the demonstration at GPO Chowk.
Videos of people being dragged out of cars and arrested for displaying PTI flags on their cars were also doing the rounds on social media.
In one footage, police could be seen beating and dragging a man out of his jeep, bearing a PTI flag. The PTI leadership has condemned the police actions to sabotage what they called “peaceful protest” against the alleged rigging in elections and stealing of mandate.
PTI central Punjab general secretary Hammad Azhar, who has been in hiding since May 9 last year, said the “controversial” chief minister, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, had committed fascism by using the state’s machinery against peaceful protesters.
The former federal minister added that his party would provide legal assistance to all those arrested by the police and annou­nced that PTI would stage another protest next week.
In Gujrat, police deta­ined several PTI workers after they staged a protest at Kutchery Chowk.
The demonstration was led by PTI’s candidate for NA-64, Qaisara Elahi, the wife of former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and her sister Sumaira Elahi.
The PTI workers reached the venue in the form of rallies from across the district, while the main rally started from the Zahoor Elahi Palace.
Protests in Sindh In Sindh, protests were staged outside press clubs across the province.
Led by senior party leaders, a major demonstration was held outside the Karachi Press Club. PTI Sindh chapter president Haleem Adil Sheikh led the protest in rural towns and small cities of Sindh, including Dhabeji, Gharo, Gujjo, Thatta, Jamshoro and Hyderabad.
In his address, Mr Sheikh said the PTI won 22 National Assembly seats and 38 of the Sindh Assembly in the province, but it was deprived of the mandate through “fake Form 47”.
“Even Sindh, which is falsely dubbed as PPP’s stronghold, has rejected the politics of corruption and nepotism,” Mr Sheikh claimed.
Demos in Islamabad
In Islamabad, a large number of PTI workers held the protest despite heavy rain. The demonstration was led by the party’s election candidates from Islamabad, Amir Mughal, Shoaib Shaheen and Ali Bukhari.
The rally started at the F-6 Super Market, and later, the protesters gathered in front of the National Press Club.
While addressing the rally, Mr Mughal said 250 million people were supporting PTI and standing shoulder to shoulder with Imran Khan.
“From Karachi to Khyber, people gave a clear message that their leader is Imran Khan. We will not allow the assemblies to run if our leader is not released and the mandate of people not returned,” he said.
While talking to Dawn, Mr Mughal said that the huge demonstration, despite rain, showed that no difficulties could stop people from supporting Mr Khan.
He said that although a heavy contingent of police was present, it did not interfere with the protest.
‘People came out in droves’
A PTI spokesman called the protests a success and said a large number of people came out on the PTI founder’s call.
Despite the use of state machinery to disrupt peaceful protests across the country, a large
number of people held demonstrations across the country against the “theft of the public mandate” on Saturday.
He said people came out “in droves” on the call of Imran Khan against election “fraud”.

1,Shehbaz poised for another term at helm,"PML-N chief enjoys support of 205 MNAs, needs 169 votes to defeat Omar Ayub; PTI-backed MNAs in no mood to cease anti-rigging protests in NA.","• PML-N chief enjoys support of 205 MNAs, needs 169 votes to defeat Omar Ayub
• PTI-backed MNAs in no mood to cease anti-rigging protests in NA
ISLAMABAD: PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, who is the joint candidate of the newly-formed eight-party alliance, looks poised to win the election for prime minister for the second time, as he faces PTI-nominated Omar Ayub Khan in the contest scheduled to be held in the newly-constituted National Assembly on Sunday (today).
Both candidates submitted their nomination papers to the National Assembly Secretariat, which were declared valid by Speaker Ayaz Sadiq after the scrutiny, conducted in the presence of the leaders from both sides.
According to the National Assem­bly Secretariat, eight nomination papers had been submitted by Mr Sharif whereas four papers were submitted by Mr Khan carrying the signatures of different proposers and seconders.
Omar Ayub had raised an objection against Shehbaz Sharif, saying the PML-N leader was ‘gifted’ his NA seat through manipulation in Form-47. He said the lawmaker could not contest the PM election because he had lost the constituency as per Form-45. He has been wrongly administered the oath as MNA and thus cannot be a candidate for the prime minister’s position, Mr Ayub said in a tweet. The objection was rejected.
After getting the offices of the speaker and the deputy speaker in nearly one-sided contests on Friday, the newly-formed alliance seems confident to win the office of the country’s chief executive whereas the PTI lawmakers, who had been elected as independents and later joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), are expected to continue their noisy protest in the house over the alleged rigging in the Feb 8 elections.
Besides the PML-N, Mr Sharif has the backing of the PPP, MQM-P, PML-Q, BAP, PML-Z, IPP, and the NP having a total of 205 members. Two MNAs-elect from the MQM-P and PPP have yet to take oath. In order to become the leader of the house, Mr Sharif requires 169 votes in the 336-member house.
On the other hand, the PTI-backed opposition has 102 lawmakers, out of which one member has not taken the oath. Meanwhile, the JUI-F and BNP-Mengal are likely to boycott the poll.
 
 

At present, 304 lawmakers have taken oath whereas the ECP has so far withheld the notification of 23 reserved seats for women and minorities.
On Friday, Mr Sadiq of PML-N won the speaker’s election after securing 199 votes against his rival Amir Dogar of PTI, who secured 91 votes in the house.
 
 

The elections of the speaker and deputy speaker were conducted through a secret ballot amid protests by PTI lawmakers who declared it “unconstitutional” saying the house was incomplete without allocation of reserved seats.
The eight JUI-F members and BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal, who had boycotted the elections for the speaker and the deputy speaker, have not made any categorical announcement about their participation in the Sunday’s election.
However, the Maulana flew to Karachi on Saturday night, indicating he would not be in the assembly for the PM’s poll.
The election will be conducted in the NA under Article 91 of the Constitution.
Article 91(3) says: “After the election of the speaker and the deputy speaker, the National Assembly shall to the exclusion of any other business, proceed to elect without debate one of its Muslim members to be the prime minister.”
“The prime minister shall be elected by the votes of the majority of the total membership of the National Assembly: provided that, if no member secures such majority in the first poll, a second poll shall be held between the members who secure the two highest numbers of votes in the first poll and the member who secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting shall be declared to have been elected as prime minister,” reads Article91(4) of the Constitution.
The procedure for the election, however, has been given in Chapter IV and Second Schedule of the Rules and Procedure for the Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007.
“Before voting commences, the speaker shall direct that the bells be rung for five minutes to enable members not present in the chamber to be present.  Immediately after the bells stop ringing, all the entrances to the lobby shall be locked and the assembly staff posted at each entrance shall not allow any entry or exit through those entrances until the voting has concluded,” according to the Second Schedule.
The speaker shall then ask the members who wish to vote in favour of the candidates to go to the allocated lobbies through the entrance where tellers shall be posted to record the votes.
On reaching the desk of the tellers, each member shall, in turn, call out the division number allotted to them under the rules. The tellers shall then mark off the number on the division list simultaneously calling out the name of the member.
In order to ensure that his vote has been properly recorded, the member shall not move off until they have clearly heard the teller call out their name.  After a member has recorded his vote, they shall not return to the chamber until bells are rung.
When the speaker finds that all the members who wished to vote have recorded their votes, he shall announce that the voting has concluded.  Thereupon the secretary shall cause the division list to be collected, count the recorded votes, and present the result of the count to the speaker.
The speaker shall then direct that the bells be rung for two minutes to enable the members to return to the chamber. After the bells stop ringing, the speaker shall announce the result to the assembly.

2,PTI fields Mahmood Khan Achakzai to face Zardari in presidential election,Nomination comes after Achakzai delivered a forceful speech in the NA against alleged role of establishment in politics.,"ISLAMABAD: Backed by PTI, firebrand Pashtun nationalist leader from Bal­o­chistan Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Satur­day submitted nomination papers to contest the upco­ming presidential election on March 9 against PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari.
Three other citizens have also filed nomination papers with the presiding officer, Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, through their respective representatives.
Advocate Farooq H. Naek filed the nomination papers for Mr Zardari, while PTI’s Sardar Latif Khosa submitted the papers for Mr Achakzai, who is the president of the Pakhtoonkhwa Mili Awami Party (PkMAP).
Former president Zardari is being backed by the PML-N-led eight-party coalition as per an understanding reached after the February 8 elections, while Mr Achakzai is the candidate of the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) alliance.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Mr Naek are the former president’s proposer and seconder, respectively. PPP’s Senator Saleem Mandviwalla was also present in the IHC during the submission of the papers. PTI’s Asad Qaiser and Ali Mohammad Khan are the proposer and seconder of Mr Achakzai, respectively.
Three other candidates, Asghar Ali Mubarak, Abdul Qadoos and Waheed Ahmed Kamal, also submitted their nomination papers as under the Constitution, any Muslim citizen of Pakistan having attained the age of 45 and eligible to become  a member of the National Assembly can contest the election for the office of the president.
However, it is expected that their papers will be rejected on technical grounds as nomination requires proposers and seconders who should be the voters, which means that they should have been nominated by members of any of the country’s six legislatures.
Secretary to the IHC chief justice, Noor Muhammad Mirza, has submitted the nomination papers to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
As per the election schedule issued by the ECP, the commission will scrutinise the forms on March 4 (tomorrow). The final list of candidates will be issued the next day, while polling will take place on March 9.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq will preside over the election proceedings in the National Assembly where MNAs and senators will poll their votes.
Polling for the president’s election will also be held in all the four provincial assemblies.
The presidential election is taking place on March 9, in line with Article 41(4) of the Constitution, which states that the election for the president must take place within 30 days after the general elections.
Since the general elections were held on Feb 8, the presidential election is required to be conducted by March 9, two days before the retirement of half of the senators after completing their six-year term.
Mr Zardari previously served as the president from September 2008 to 2013 after the resignation of the military ruler Pervez Musharraf.
But Mr Achakzai’s nomination for the president’s office was a surprise, coming only a day after the Baloch nationalist leader delivered a forceful speech in the National Assembly against the alleged role of the military establishment in politics and in support of the jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
Commenting on the development, PML-N’s Khawaja Asif, during an informal chat with some reporters at the Parliament House, taunted the PTI by saying it seemed that “the party has changed its brand.”
PPP’s Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also said while he has great respect for Mr Achakzai, if he becomes PTI’s candidate for the post of president, he cannot refer to himself as a nationalist.
Meanwhile, after his nomination for the office of the president by the PTI, Mr Achakzai called on JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to seek his support.

3,CM Bugti extends olive branch to Baloch insurgents,"""I will invite the angry people repeatedly to come down and become good citizens and join the struggle of the government,"" Bugti says."," 

Balochistan Governor Malik Wali Khan Kakar administers the oath to newly elected Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti at Governor House, on Saturday.—APP

QUETTA: The newly elected Chief Minister of Balochistan, Mir Sarfraz Ahmed Bugti, has urged the Baloch insurgents to abandon their armed struggle and join mainstream politics for the achievement of the people’s rights.
Speaking on the floor of the house on Saturday after being elected unopposed as Balochistan chief minister, Mr Bugti said: “Rights could not be achieved through arms.”
He said dialogue was the right path for resolving all issues and his party believes in dialogue and reconciliation for resolving any conflict and wants that the insurgents sitting on the mountains should come down, join mainstream and take part in the development of Pakistan, especially the province of Balochistan.
“I will invite the angry people repeatedly to come down and become good citizens and join the struggle of the government in its efforts for the development of the country,” Mr Bugti said. He said the government would extend all help and cooperation for the achievement of their rights determined in the constitution.
He said that parliament is the forum which ensures the rights of every citizen. He said that there are two tolls of dealing with violence; one is dialogue and other deterrence.
However, Mr Bugti made it clear that despite repeated appeal for abandoning violence, if they would continue to challenge the writ of the state, the government would fulfill its responsibility to maintain the writ and supremacy of law and protection of the life and priority of the people.
While referring to other issues said that the government will take all possible steps for resolving the issue of governess, education, health in the province.
Earlier, the Balochistan Assembly formally elected Mr Bugti as the 18th chief minister who took the oath of office at a ceremony held at Governor House, here on Saturday.
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari along with party leadership, government officials and party workers attended the ceremony.
Balochistan Governor Malik Wali Muhammad Kakar administrated the oath to the new chief minister of Balochistan.
 


Earlier, the Balochistan Assembly in its session, which was presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, elected Mr Bugti as leader of the house through voting. He obtained 41 votes in the house of 65 members while the National Party, headed by Dr Malik Baloch, did not take part in the election. The NP, which has four seats in the house, had earlier boycotted the election of the speaker and deputy speaker too while announcing that their lawmakers would sit on the opposition benches.
The JUI-F, which has a strength of 10 members, remained absent from the house during voting for the election on the top slot of the province.
Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Abdul Majeed Badini and Haq do Tehreek’s leader Maulana Hidaytur Rehman cast their vote in favour of PPP and Pakistan Muslim League-N’s joint candidate for the top slot of the province. The Awami National Party who has three members in the assembly also supported Mr Bugti.
Mr Alyani, who has been elected to a seat of both national and provincial assemblies, was not present in the house. He has yet to decide which seat he wants to retain.

4,"Amid X outage, ban sought on all social media","Reports of blanket ban on VPNs worry industry; activists warn of threats to fundamental rights, economic growth, country’s reputation.","ISLAMABAD: While there are serious concerns among users over the continued disruption of the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) for over a fortnight now, a member of the upper house of parliament has called for a permanent ban on all social media.
Meanwhile, there are reports that the authorities are considering a blanket ban on all Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), prompting the IT and services sector to express concerns that such action could severely harm the country’s economy.
Senator Bahramand Khan Tangi, who was recently expelled by the PPP after he moved a resolution seeking the delaying of the Feb 8 polls, has submitted another resolution, this time calling for a complete ban on all social media platforms, deeming them detrimental to the future of the young generation.
The resolution is listed on the agenda of the Senate session scheduled for Monday (March 4).
The resolution submitted by Senator Tangi, who is set to retire on March 11, states that “social media platforms are adversely affecting the young generation in the country… [and] being used for promotion of norms against our religion and culture, creating hatred among people on the grounds of language and religion”.

Reports of blanket ban on VPNs worry industry; activists warn of threats to fundamental rights, economic growth, country’s reputation

The resolution notes with concern “the use of such platforms against the interests of the country through negative and malicious propaganda against the armed forces of Pakistan” and calls upon the Senate to recommend to the government to put a ban on Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, and YouTube to save the young generation from their negative and devastating effects.
 
 

The X website has been largely offline since February 17, with occasional service restorations, mainly after former commissioner Rawalpindi Liaquat Ali Chatta made a statement in front of the media claiming that the “elections were rigged”.
On the other hand, a majority of users are using VPNs to access the platform. There are numerous posts mocking the authorities, even caretaker IT Minister Umar Saif for using a VPN, as his current location in recent tweets is showing as Hong Kong.
But so far, no authority has taken responsibility for restricting the services of X, which activists see as a dangerous trend.
“This way, those in power are telling that they can ban any platform without any reason or being answerable to anyone,” said Nighat Dad, a digital rights activist and member of the UN Secretary General’s advisory board on AI.
She added that such a blanket ban on any platform is a violation of fundamental rights, and those in power are not considering the reputation of the country worldwide, especially concerning those who are being invited to invest in Pakistan.
Rumours that even VPNs will be banned in the country have rung alarm bells in the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA).
P@SHA expressed its concern, claiming that such a proposal for a blanket ban on VPNs in the country would have detrimental consequences for Pakistan’s economy and its burgeoning reputation as a tech and innovation hub.
P@SHA said that a VPN ban would not only disrupt business operations but also stifle growth for companies and individuals heavily reliant on dynamic IPs for their work.
“The banking sector, in particular, faces severe financial repercussions due to restricted access to VPNs, hindering their ability to manage international transactions effectively,” a statement by P@SHA said, adding that such bottlenecks would obstructs the government’s vision of achieving the $15 billion exports target for the IT and IT services and also undermines the extensive endeavours of SIFC to facilitate the ease of doing business.
“Without losing reputational credibility, competitive advantage, and clientele, we advocate for the formation of a joint working group with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to ensure the uninterrupted operation of internet services while addressing regulatory concerns,” P@SHA said.
Currently, all commercial users are required to get their VPNs registered at PTA in two categories for companies and freelancers, while IP Whitelisting is required for call centres and for video conferences for organisations and companies.
Currently, more than 3,540 VPNs and 25,085 IP addresses have been registered with the PTA, but there is no bar on individuals using VPNs for non-commercial purposes.
