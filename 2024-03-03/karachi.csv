Later, talking to the media, the CM hoped that Mr Zardari would win the presidential poll with highest votes.
When asked whether the party would seek votes from the MQM-P, the CM replied that the PPP had “a good working relationship with the MQM-P and they had been our coalition partners”. 
“We would seek their voter for Asif Ali Zardari,” he said and added his party would visit all the political forces in the parliament to seek their vote.
About the MQM-P’s recent agreement with the PML-N on empowered local government system, he claimed that the local government system in Sindh was “more effective, powerful and efficient than other provinces”.
The MQM-P had taken up the issue of strengthening local governments in Punjab, where this level/tier of government had not been properly established, he added.
CM stated that the MQM-P wanted to replicate better works of the Sindh government in the Punjab local governments for which it had made an agreement with the PML-N.
Mr Shah also stated that he would form his cabinet soon in consultation with his party leadership.
Later in the evening, he told reporters in Sehwan that the PPP would not only approach the MQM-P but wanted to see it voting for Mr Zardari, who is the joint candidate of the PPP and PML-N for presidency.

The CM said being the president Mr Zardari had transferred his powers to parliament. He recalled that in 2008 he had brought about reconciliation among all political parties and formed a coalition government with the MQM in Sindh. 
He said that the PPP wanted stability in the country and that’s why it was working with PML-N. He said that the PPP had made it clear that no government could be formed without its support.

3,Four held for stealing oil from refinery pipeline,KARACHI: Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested four suspects for their alleged involvement in stealing oil ...,"KARACHI: Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested four suspects for their alleged involvement in stealing oil from a pipeline in Korangi.
Police said that they got a lead that an organised gang had raised some structure at a desolate place within the remit of the Awami Colony police station to steal oil from an underground pipeline that transports the commodity from port to a refinery in Korangi.
They said that the suspects filled their tankers with the stolen oil and sold it in the market.
The police said that they had arrested the owner and driver of the oil tanker and two others in a raid carried out on Saturday.
Earlier in January, the Pak-Arab Refinery Company (PARCO) had filed a police case against some suspects and stated that they leased a warehouse only to tap into an underground pipeline to steal oil.
Meanwhile, a 60-year-old woman, identified as Sabira Khatoon, was found dead in her Arambagh flat on Saturday.
She was a widow and lived alone, said a police official. “There were visible marks of strangulation around her neck. We suspect that the victim knew the murderer well, who might be a frequent visitor or her place,” said the official.

He submitted that the utilities connections had been disconnected and the SBCA officials were intending to demolish the building, which was constructed around five years ago.  
The bench took exception to the inaction of SBCA officials regarding illegal and unauthorised constructions and directed the director general to appear along with a complete record of illegal and unauthorised buildings built in Central within 15 days.  
It sought details of buildings erected without approval of building plan, the time period of such constructions and completion year and number of occupants residing in such buildings and whether the utility connections had been provided with consent of the SBCA.  
The bench also asked the DG to also file details of owners of such buildings/companies who raised constructions and said that the SBCA would be competent to seek assistance from the Karachi Development Authority and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation in respect of legal status of such properties.  
The bench ruled that the operation of SHC’s order issued on Jan 24 about demolition of subject building would remain suspended till next hearing.

5,PTI stages Sindh-wide protests against ‘rigging’ in Feb 8 polls,A large number of protesters converge outside Karachi Press Club to observe sit-in,"KARACHI: In line with a call of party founder Imran Khan to protest against alleged rigging in Feb 8 elections, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf organised protest demonstrations, took out rallies and staged sit-ins outside press clubs across Sindh on Saturday.  
Led by senior party leaders and legislators, the protest activities were held in major cities of the province with a major show outside the Karachi Press Club.  
The Sindh chapter president of the party, Haleem Adil Sheikh, led the protest in rural towns and small cities of Sindh including Dhabeji, Gharo, Gujjo, Thatta, Jamshoro and Hyderabad.  
Earlier in the day Mr Sheikh left the city in a caravan to Sindh cities with a number of party workers and leaders.  

A large number of protesters converge outside Karachi Press Club to observe sit-in  

He first stopped at Dhabeji where he addressed a protest demonstration attended by a large number of people.  
“The nation has rejected all cases against Imran Khan,” he said.  
“Even Sindh which is falsely dubbed as Pakistani Peoples’ Party ‘stronghold’ has rejected the politics of corruption and nepotism. We have won from all Sindh districts but the fake mandate was imposed through Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan and the PPP. But the people have spoken out and no one can silence them.” 
He drove to Thatta, Jamshoro and Hyderabad and addressed the protest demonstrations and sit-ins along his route.  
In Karachi, led by senior leaders, PTI workers joined protest marchers arriving from different parts of the city in rallies and converged outside the Karachi Press Club for a big demonstration.  
Carrying PTI flags, chanting slogans and dancing to the tunes of party songs, the participants, including women and children, demanded free and fair inquiry into rigging allegations during Feb 8 elections.  
Addressing the party workers at the Karachi Press Club, PTI leader Saifur Rehman said that the participation of Karachiites in huge numbers in the demonstration reflected the fact that they had rejected the results of Feb 8 polls.  
“Imran Khan has called on the people across the country to protest against the theft of the mandate in the streets and these protests across the country prove that the people of Pakistan stand with Imran Khan,” he said.  
Another party leader Alamgir Khan in his address claimed that the PTI had won 22 seats of National Assembly from Sindh, including 20 alone in Karachi.  
“We have won 38 seats of the provincial assembly of Sindh and similarly, we have won 183 National Assembly seats across the country. But the result of all were altered through rigging in Form-47,” he added.  
He said that Karachi and Hyderabad’s mandate were snatched from the people and given to the MQM-P.  
“Those who have actually won the elections are out from the parliament and those who rigged the elections under fake Form-47 are sitting inside the parliament,” he added.

6,The temporariness of home,KARACHI: In William Shakespeare’s comedy The Taming of the Shrew after Kate (shrew) finally understands the...,"

KARACHI: In William Shakespeare’s comedy The Taming of the Shrew after Kate (shrew) finally understands the importance of a married life defines home as a place where one feels ‘secure and safe’. This is the most basic aspect of having a home: to feel unafraid. In modern times, however, sociopolitical, in certain cases psychological, upheavals have caused large-scale displacements divesting people of their homes. This implies a constant sense of insecurity. The artist community knows it very well. 
Ayessha Quraishi’s latest exhibition titled Temporary Homes Cast Temporary Shadows that concluded on Friday at the Koel Art Gallery in an is an insightful reminder of the situation.
Quraishi has carved a niche in the art world by virtue of a visual language that’s her own. In that regard, while praising her technique, the gallery highlights her ‘gestural mark-making’ style; it is indeed of top-notch quality. But the other thing that the artist does with remarkable creative alacrity is that she imbues her work with certain tenderness through the feathery use of mediums such as ink and oil. This tenderness, in turn, augments the poignancy of the subject matter she wishes to put across. ‘The Waters’ and ‘The Stolen Wave’ series are two very fine examples.
In order to get the drift of what it means to the artist to lose a home she predicates the idea on her discussion with a poet about water: “…How it flows from and with memories that have sometimes personal, sometimes internal and sometimes global meanings.”
Now in art water is a symbol of change, which is what Quraishi is hinting at. However, in literature, especially with reference to mythology, it also symbolises fertility. While the energy that the artworks exude talks about change, it can be interpreted not just in terms of loss but also as something that may change… for the better.Good stuff!

7,"Experts discuss ways to combat human trafficking, bonded labour in Sindh",Say Pakistan’s ranking in Tier II watch list of the crimes improved in the last two years,"KARACHI: Experts on Saturday discussed ways to combat human trafficking and bonded labour in Sindh during a session organised by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO) in collaboration with Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) and US Embassy Islamabad. 
Speakers from the US, representatives of the Sindh Government, academia, media, parliamentarians and civil society participated in the session.
It was pointed out that despite being on Tier II watch list, Pakistan had improved to Tier II in 2022 and 2023 due to government actions such as curbing trafficking and prohibiting child soldier recruitment.
The speakers said Pakistan’s strategic location fostered Trafficking in Persons (TIP) and smuggling of migrants, which was compounded by refugee influx.
Syed Kausar Abbas, executive director SSDO, emphasised the importance of implementation and awareness at the district level and identifying government departments responsible for enforcing TIP regulations. 

Say Pakistan’s ranking in Tier II watch list of the crimes improved in the last two years

He also highlighted specific cases handled by the SSDO, stressing the police’s obligation to act against TIP. Plans for an MOU between the SHRC and SSDO regarding TIP were mentioned, along with expanding human rights topics in the judiciary.
Mr Abbas added that capacity-building efforts, supported by the international community, were ongoing and that the SSDO aimed to establish a network of civil society organisations to combat TIP effectively.
Chairperson SHRC Iqbal Detho expressed gratitude to newly elected members and government departments for their participation in the session. He said the country’s Constitution prohibited slavery and human trafficking under Articles 3 and 11.
Mr Detho mentioned Pakistan Penal Code’s provisions on human trafficking, bonded labor, commercial sexual exploitation, and child labor and added that the SHRC intended to collaborate with the standing committee to review laws related to those matters.
With the authority to review laws, SHRC aimed to improve conditions for labor and agricultural workers in the informal sector, advocating for a wage increase from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 32,000 through the labor department, he said and commended the labor department’s dedication to the cause.
Joseph Salavarria, former law enforcement officer of the US and expert on combatting TIP, suggested a deeper understanding of what could be accomplished positively whereas Ansa Noreen, a TIP survivor and executive director of US based organisation ‘Empowerment Square’ in New York mentioned her provision of legal services in the US and said there was a need to work on the survivors of TIP to mainstream them in the society. The state needed to allocate resources for rehabilitation services of the victims, she added.
Pakistan Peoples Party’s Marvi Rashdi emphasised the complexity and time-consuming nature of addressing organised crime, noting its substantial financial incentives worldwide. She also stressed the challenge of identifying the locations of such crimes and highlighted the ongoing need for legislative amendments. She proposed the establishment of dedicated human trafficking courts to effectively address those issues.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Ali Khursheedi emphasised the vital role of police. He highlighted various issues that needed attention as well as the importance of raising awareness about available acts and institutions dedicated to addressing such issues. He urged all political parties to prioritise the matter collectively.
MQM-P’s advocate Sofia Shah pointed out the challenges individuals faced in identifying appropriate authorities for specific cases and spoke about the importance of broadcasting public service messages to raise awareness about human trafficking. She also highlighted how economic hardships worsened the issue, which led to increased suffering among affected individuals.
TIP expert Waqar Haider said human trafficking was a form of organised crime. He noted its coverage in FIA courses and highlighted discussions surrounding compensation under the relevant act.
SSP CTD Fida Hussain highlighted efforts to educate initial responders about human trafficking and stressed the need to raise awareness among the general public. He discussed the confusion victims faced in seeking help and the lack of clarity among law enforcement regarding appropriate actions, emphasising the need to clarify roles outlined in police and FIA regulations.
SP Zafar from the police department mentioned that 406 TIP cases were registered, with 1900 police officers receiving training on TIP. He stressed organising awareness sessions for new staff and utilising the 1715 CPO helpline. Mr Zafar also highlighted Sindh police’s inclusion of women at the district level in child and women cells. He added that despite TIP being relatively new, efforts were made to register cases under TIP, alongside the Pakistan Penal Code, aiming to enhance police’s contributions to combat it.
Rejomal, law officer from the labour department, discussed the enactment of the Labor Act, noting its shortcomings and the challenges faced by oversight committees under the deputy commissioner’s control. He mentioned the introduction of new laws such as Women’s Agricultural Act and regulations for home-based workers.
The speakers also stressed the importance of explicitly including TIP section in related cases, citing specialised acts relevant to each specific case and nderstanding the root causes behind the issue was also emphasised. 
They said that while acts were available, there was need for effective implementation. TIP cases, including specific instances such as the Shikarpur and Jacobabad cases, were also highlighted during the session and attention was also drawn to the issue of bonded labour.
Zakiriya Rizvi, representative of the US Embassy Islamabad, said that the role of SSDO to strengthen the coordination and bridge the gap between different stakeholders was commendable. Rida Tahir, legal expert at SHRC, discussed the legal aspects of TIP during the event and moderated the programme.

According to co-patron of the team TEDx and director of IBA, Prof Dr Imamuddin Khoso, the event scheduled for March 5 will prove to be an intellectual extravaganza, leaving attendees captivated and inspired.
He said the thought-provoking gathering would feature an array of dynamic speakers, each offering their unique 
perspectives on a wide range of subjects, from education to environmental preservation.
He said the TEDx University of Sindh would be an event full of wisdom, inspiration, productivity and entertainment, adding that Qawwali, Mushaira and musical band performances would also be the part of the conference.
On the other hand, the university’s spokesman termed the conference being organised under a license from the US-based company a milestone for the varsity. The TEDx University of Sindh would help empower ideas and celebrate freedom of thoughts, he said.
SU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Muhammad Siddique Kalhoro would address the inaugural ceremony, setting the tone for a day filled with intellectual stimulation.
The TEDx SU 2024 is officially licensed by TED, after ensuring strict adherence to TEDx standards and guidelines.
TED stands for “Technology, Entertainment and Design” — three broad subject areas that are collectively shaping our world. But a TEDx conference is broader still, showcasing important research and ideas from all disciplines and exploring how they connect, says the press release.
