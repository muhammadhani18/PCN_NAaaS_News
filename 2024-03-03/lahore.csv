Mr Shah also highlighted the achievements of Pakistani art in the last 75 years and the challenges posed by the dictatorship of Gen Ziaul Haq who had halted all cultural societies. He said he wanted the conversation happening in Multan to reach the whole world. He said Lahore was not only the scientific, literary and central city of Pakistan but also of India.

4,Caretakers’ step to give e-Library to PCB raises eyebrows,Move seems to be a challenge to Maryam’s vision,"LAHORE: The former caretaker cabinet’s hastily approval of giving control of the e-Library situated in the Nishtar Sports Complex near the Gaddafi Stadium to the Pakistan Cricket Board has raised many an eyebrows as interim ex-CM Mohsin Naqvi was to take the reins of the PCB after the new dispensation is in place. 
The move seems to be a challenge to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz who, in her maiden speech, had said that e-library is the vision of the PML-N under which a good number of libraries were set up in the province by Shehbaz Sharif’s government. 
According to a Punjab Sports Department’s official, Mr Naqvi as caretaker chief minister and PCB chairman paid a surprise to visit to the e-Library during the PSL-9 matches and decided on the spot to hand it over to the PCB to set up a cricket museum in the building. 
According to the official, 9,600 students doing PhD, MPhil and CSS [aspirants] were benefiting from the e-Library as regular members, without any fee. 

Move seems to be a challenge to Maryam’s vision

“They have access to free net service, computers and a comfortable environment to continue their study and they all are unhappy over this decision of Mohsin Naqvi,” the official said. He said the caretaker Punjab government had also got the approval of the cabinet in its Feb 18 meeting ‘in haste’. 
According to the minutes of the cabinet’s meeting, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Mohsin was showing haste in taking over the e-Library. 
“9.5: The Law Department observed that e-Library situated at Abdul Hafeez Kardar Road, Nishtar Sports Complex, being administered through Youth Affairs and Sports, is an asset of Government of the Punjab, therefore, Provincial Cabinet is duly authorised to transfer the same to the Pakistan Cricket Board, an autonomous body of Federal Government, for setting up a Cricket Museum, as per its request. 
“However, it may be observed that the modalities for such allotment are required to be worked out by the administrative department with the PCB, in the shape of an agreement/MoU to be vetted by this department, with the foregoing observations, if deemed appropriate the chief minister may like to place the matter before provincial cabinet for consideration/decision. 
“9.6: Accordingly, the cabinet was requested to consider and approve that the administrative control of e-Library may be handed over to PCB for setting up a Cricket Museum. The terms and conditions of the agreement shall be finalised by the PCB and the Punjab Sports Board. 
“Decision No. 09: The cabinet considered and approved the proposal contained in para 9.6 above. In the meanwhile, the operational control of e-Library may be handed over to PCB without waiting for the issuance of the minutes of the cabinet meeting,” it concluded. 
Meanwhile, the official said the sports secretary was reluctant to hand over the e-Library. One of the member students said CM Maryum should take an immediate action to stop it. 
The member also said the PCB had a good number of shops in the Gaddafi Stadium and it would be better to set up the cricket museum in some shops, instead of renting them out. 
When contacted, the PCB media department kept mum and spokesperson of Punjab government Marrium Aurangzeb also did not respond. 
It merits mentioning that the PCB had already taken over the high performance centres of the Punjab Sports Department, which were established in Sialkot and Faisalabad. The game of cricket is not included in the list of the Punjab Sports 
Department, as it has to promote other games like hockey, football, boxing and others. Owing to the glamour of the game in the country, the department had been involved in cricket activities. In the previous Punjab government, Shahbaz 
Sharif as chief minister had hired the services of former Test cricketer Zaheer Abbas to set up the cricket academies in the province. The project rolled over soon after the end of the Shahbaz’s government in 2018. Later, in PTI’s government in Punjab, Sports Board Director General Tariq Qureshi ‘unnecessarily’ prepared two high performance centres in Sialkot and Faisalabad, while it was the job of the PCB to set up such centres. 
Moreover, the PCB had already taken control of the LCCA ground, adjacent to the e-Library, which had never been its property as it belonged to the Lahore City Cricket Association since 1962. The ground was given to the PCB some three years back by the Lahore commissioner, despite the fact the cricket board is not the owner of the ground. The infrastructure of the LCCA ground is in a bad shape as no renovation work was done by the PCB in the last three years.

“The best medical professionals and technical members should be included in the boards of management of public sector hospitals purely on merit,” she said.
The meeting said that a special hospital should be established to provide best cancer treatment facilities to poor patients.

8,Young filmmakers urged to leave TV style of filming,Veteran filmmaker says Pakistani market very sizable and needs to be explored.,"LAHORE: Veteran film actor from Pakistan with international fame Salman Peerzada says the younger lot of filmmakers in the country need to understand the business of film and come out of TV style of filming, paying more attention to the visual part of storytelling.
The Blood of Hussain actor was a part of panel discussion on ‘The Future of Films in Pakistan’ as a part of the 40 years celebration of a private chain of schools at a hotel on Saturday. Film producer, director and theatre actor Sana Jafri, premier transgender actor Alina Khan, film producer Zakir Thaver, and producer, writer and director Kamil Cheema were the other participants.
Mr Peerzada saw a lot of hope as the younger lot of filmmakers was doing a marvelous job. He saw a lot of hope for the future of films as new subjects were coming up from time to time.
He said the Pakistani market was very sizable and the filmmakers needed to explore the home market while the movies needed to be seen in the cities like Multan besides Lahore.
“When I was working there were 1,000 cinemas in the country but now there are only 300 cinemas,” he lamented at the less number of screens with the passage of time.
Perzaada said the young filmmakers needed to come together and form unions to help each other in making films.
When asked how her journey had been in the film as a woman, Sana Jafri, the co-prouder of Joyland, said she had been asked this question so many times that she would like to move forward from that. However, she talked about how people on the sets would not take her seriously at the start but things had changed for her now and she did not feel being discriminated against on the sets for being a woman. “But if I go out of the industry to get things like NOCs etc in govt offices, I feel a lot of hardships. I think that comes from the general attitude towards women in society.”
Sana acknowledged that just being a filmmaker in itself was hard as there were so many other problems such as censorship would start with the start of scriptwriting.
Kamil Cheeema, the writer and producer of Laal Kabootar, said when he started there was a boom in the cinema in Pakistan as every week we had a premiere of some Indian movie with the visits of Bollywood stars and there would be a Pakistani film released every fifth or sixth week. “That boom ended just two weeks before the release of Laal Kabootar as the attack happened (in India) and India stopped sending films here,” he lamented.
Alina Khan, who played the lead in Joyland, talked about how her life as a trasnperson changed after the release of her film and the response it got. “It was a dream for me as earlier my community was shown in comic roles only but the producers and director of Joyland gave me an opportunity to represent my community in a more humanising way.” She said the movie gave her a chance to work with senior actors like Salman Peerzada in the industry who encouraged her.
Alina said she had got some success too in changing the mindset of the people regarding the transpersons.
Zakir Thaver, the producer of Salaam—The First**** Nobel Laureate, said the Sacred Games was made with a million dollar budget. “The delta between the kind of budget that we have here in Pakistan and other film industries is huge,” he said.
Zakir rued the fact that Pakistan did not have archives and it was so hard to get archives from the PTV which was acting as a gatekeeper regarding the archive. He pointed out that he spent years to collect archives on Dr Abdus Salam from Multan to South Africa, adding that it was easier to get archives even in Italy compared to Pakistan and whatever archives he had got from Pakistan were from personal collections of private people, not the government institutions like the PTV.
Cheema said if we had Bollywood films being screened in Pakistan, we would have a different discussion right now due to the influence of Bollywood cinema. “Bollywood has essentially a South Asian storytelling style and we have forgotten that that’s our art of storytelling with song and dance. Since the time of Waris Shah (Punjabi classic poet) we have been narrating our stories with poetry.” He called it a really very indigenous style of storytelling, saying that he would reclaim a Bollywood style of story and tell it for the audience here in an independent way.
Sana Jafri endorsed the point of view of her fellow panelists, saying that Bollywood had a big budget to tell its stories in the cinema which was missing in Pakistan. “All the films that do well in Pakistan are actually inspired by Bollywood, having songs and action.” She said the filmmakers tended to do the films that the audience wanted to watch but there should be indigenous stories made with the local resources without replicating what they do in Bollywood.
