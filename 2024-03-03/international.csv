2,Less invasive kidney treatment launched,"This enables precise identification and removal of kidney stones, which can be fragmented and drained effectively","The Mayo Hospital has introduced a modern procedure for the treatment of kidney stones.
According to sources in the hospital, Professor Fawad Nasrullah, Chairman of the Urology Department, spearheaded the initiative aiming to provide comprehensive stone removal solutions.
During the procedure, a minimally invasive approach is adopted, wherein a small incision is made in the lower back, allowing for the insertion of a tube equipped with a microscopic camera and advanced surgical instruments. This enables precise identification and removal of kidney stones, which can be fragmented and drained effectively.
Professor Nasrullah emphasised the efficiency of the procedure, highlighting that it can be completed within two hours, with patients being discharged after a short postoperative observation period.

3,DIG transferred amidst murder probe,There are concerns that the incident could reignite a wave of violent gang warfare in the city,"In the midst of the ongoing investigation into the high-profile murder case of Balaj Ameer Tipu, DIG Captain (retd) Liaqat Malik, head of the Organised Crime Unit (OCU), has been transferred, with no major breakthrough yet in the case.
DIG Malik has been reassigned as the DIG Establishment at the Central Police Office (CPO) in Lahore.
Taking his place as the DIG OCU is DIG Imran Kishwar, his fellow alumnus from the National Police Academy (NPA), who was previously serving as the DIG Investigations in Lahore.
Meanwhile, DIG Zeeshan Asghar, who held the position of DIG Establishment at the CPO, has been appointed as the new DIG Investigations in Lahore.
The murder case of Ameer Balaj Tipu, son and grandson of Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala and Ameerul Din alias Bila Truckanwala respectively, has been under investigation by a joint team led by SP Couth OCU Aftab Phularwan and SP Investigations Sadar Mustansir Bajwa.
The suspects in the case, including Teefi Butt and Gogi Butt, are accused not only of Balaj's murder but also of the killings of his father and grandfather in 2010 and 1994, respectively. Both families, the Truckanwalas and the Butts, wield considerable influence and have ties to various sectors including the police, political circles, and the underworld of Lahore.
There are concerns that the incident could reignite a wave of violent gang warfare in the city, which has enjoyed relative peace for over a decade. Imran and Liaqat have officially handed over their duties in their respective positions.
