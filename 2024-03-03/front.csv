0,Omar decries beginning of a fascist regime,Says treasury benches beneficiary of Form 47; expresses resolve to struggle until Imran is released,"Omar Ayub, the prime ministerial candidate of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), has described the upcoming PML-N-led government as a fascist regime, representing a continuation of the last Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government.
In his speech on the floor of the National Assembly after the election of PML-N’s Shehbaz Sharif as the 24th prime minister of the country on Sunday, Omar decried the ruling coalition for its alleged lack of ideology. “The only ideology of the upcoming government is financial corruption,” he said.
Omar, who received 92 votes against 201 votes cast for Shehbaz in the prime ministerial election, lamented that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not allocate reserved seats to the SIC.
He claimed this unconstitutional move made the entire process for the election of NA speaker, deputy speaker, and the prime minister illegal.
""We had raised the point under the Constitution that this house is out of order, but outgoing NA speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf overruled our objection.""
The SIC’s candidate claimed that the incoming government was formed based on the ECP’s Form 47.
He said if election results were based on Form 45 then the SIC would have 180 lawmakers in the lower house.
ECP’s Form 45 is also known as the ""Result of the Count"" form. It is filled out at the polling station level after the counting of votes is completed.
Form 45 contains details such as the number of votes cast for each candidate and is signed by the presiding officer of the polling station. It serves as a record of the results at the polling station level.
Form 47, on the other hand, is compiled at the constituency level and contains the consolidated results from all polling stations within that constituency.
It provides an overview of the election results for a particular constituency and is an important document for the tabulation of results at higher levels of the electoral process.
Omar said: “The government lawmakers sitting here are beneficiaries of Form 47. However, the government that they are going to form is an ill-assorted group.”
The politician who originally belongs to the PTI lamented that when he was given the floor of the house after the speech of the newly elected prime minister, the cameras of the state-owned television channels stopped their live broadcast of the assembly session.
“My speech should also be live-broadcast,” he said.
The SIC candidate said the faces of the lawmakers belonging to the PML-N and its allies were faces of defeated people. “Their faces show that they have stolen the elections. When a thief flees after snatching something there is fear on his face,” he said.
Referring to the PTI’s protests against alleged rigging in the February 8 polls on Saturday, he said in the wake of the protest, 80 cases were registered only against the PTI workers in Lahore.
“And despite this highhandedness, they claim that they are democratic people.”

He said the PTI was deprived of its election symbol and later it was also deprived of its success based on Form 45. “However, despite all challenges, the party remained steadfast and will continue to do so until former PM Imran Khan is released from jail and elected as the country’s prime minister,” he said.
The ECP deprived the PTI of its election symbol weeks before the February 8 elections. The PTI candidates later contested the elections as independents and collectively won more seats than the biggest political party, the PML-N.
The PTI backed independents later joined the little-known SIC and applied for the allocation of reserved seats. However, the ECP reserved its decision on its petition.
Talking with reference to the acts of vandalism that occurred across the country on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Imran Khan, Omar said innocent people were also martyred on May 9 when authorities opened fire on peaceful protestors.
“Who is responsible for this? We demand a judicial inquiry into the events of May 9. Video footage should be presented to reveal the facts,” he said.
During Omar Ayub's speech, some members of the PML-N, including Atta Tarar, gathered around his desk and continued shouting slogans. They, however, returned to their seats at the request of former speaker Asad Qaiser.
Earlier, the NA session convened to elect the new prime minister commenced amid ruckus as PTI-backed SIC and PML-N lawmakers chanted slogans against each other.
The speaker commenced the proceedings to elect the PM amid noisy protests by PTI-backed lawmakers carrying posters of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan and chanting slogans against the PML-N.
Throughout the day, PTI-SIC members kept resorting to calling opponents ""chor"" (thief)—a reference to corruption allegations that have been following Sharifs and others over the years.
The PMLN-led alliance on the other hand kept repeating the slogan of ""Ghari Chor"" — watch thief — in a reference to the Toshakhana case in which Imran Khan was convicted for misusing the state’s gift repository by selling precious gifts including a watch gifted by Saudi royals in open market.
Soon after the speaker declared Shehbaz as the new prime minister of the country, PTI-SIC lawmakers encircled the newly-elected PM’s chair. The assembly was abuzz with slogans of 'sher' and 'chor'. Amid the sloganeering, PM Shehbaz began his maiden speech.
Shehbaz delivered the speech while standing beside his elder brother and three-time former PM Nawaz Sharif who was elected as an MNA but opted out of the race for the prime minister just days after the general elections.
Gohar’s reservations
Later, speaking to the media at Gate No 1 of the Parliament House, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan expressed reservations about the proceedings of the National Assembly.
He said while Shehbaz Sharif was shown live on TV, Omar Ayub was not given coverage despite the fact that the NA deputy speaker did not censor any of Omar's words.
“If such incidents happen again, it will become very difficult to function here. Despite all injustices, we are present in the Parliament House, but if this trend continues, it will be difficult for the parliament's proceedings and cooperation,” he said.
Khan lamented that the PTI leaders and workers were in jails, “which should not have been the case under any circumstances.”
On the occasion, Omar Ayub stated that according to Shehbaz Sharif, the country's debt has soared to $80 trillion. “Our reserves and economy are in dire straits, and the country's economy has shrunk. No investor will come in this environment.”
He said the party is eager to bring improvement and change in the country. “We want the drama orchestrated under Form 47 to be exposed,” he added.

1,JUI-F announces it will sit on opposition benches,Fazl says nationwide movement will be launched to bring about change,"Maulana Fazlur Rehman, announcing the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F)'s intention to organize a nationwide movement against alleged vote rigging, stated on Sunday that they would take a firm stance by occupying the opposition benches in the National Assembly and abstaining from voting in parliamentary proceedings.
Speaking at a press conference in Karachi, Fazlur Rehman acknowledged the current lack of conducive conditions for a grand alliance. ""While we haven't proposed a grand alliance yet, we are devising a comprehensive plan to drive the movement forward across the country,"" he informed reporters.

Casting doubt on the legitimacy of the present parliament, Fazlur Rehman remarked, ""This assembly does not truly represent the will of the people. It is a result of electoral manipulation, where some may claim authority, yet they will govern over bodies, not the hearts of the people,"" emphasized the JUI-F leader.
“Parliament is losing its importance, and democracy is losing its case. We have rejected the results of the elections. Our Majlis-e-Amila [executive committee] decided that we will go to parliament but with reservations,” he continued. The position we have taken is supported by the evidence.”

According to Fazl, the elections in 2018 and 2024 were both rigged as they produced the same results for the PML-N [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz], the PPP [Pakistan Peoples Party], and the PTI [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]. “So when the 2018 elections were rigged, why not the 2024 elections,” he asked.
“We will prepare a strategy to run a movement in the whole country. We will carry out a public campaign with full force, which will lead to change,” he said. Responding to a question, he added that the JUI-F had not proposed a grand alliance.
Fazl defended contacts with other parties. “We have no personal quarrel with anyone, we respect those who come to us. Meetings with political leaders help understand the situation,” he said. He reiterated that his party would sit with other parties on the opposition benches.
Responding to a question about the presidential elections, the JUI-F chief stated that he wanted to vote for the opposition’s candidate Mahmood Khan Achakzai against the ruling coalition’s Asif Zardari, but added that he was bound by the party’s decision.
Fazl also criticised the establishment role in the election process. He added that sometimes the establishment came under international pressure. “If I meet the leadership of Hamas, the international powers will be angry,” he said.

2,Shehbaz takes the helm with G20 dreams,New PM shoots for G20 membership by 2030; vows to make nation 'self-sufficient'," 
In a not-so-shocking spectacle on Sunday, Shehbaz Sharif took the reins as the 24th Prime Minister of Pakistan and wasted no time in diving into the nation's ongoing challenges while setting his sights on the lofty goal of steering the country into the elite G20 club by 2030.
The new captain of the ship sailed smoothly to victory – returning to the throne after a brief hiatus since August 2023 – leaving his opponent Omar Ayub securing a mere 92 votes, precisely 24 days after the country's 'controversial general elections.'
The magic number to seize the prime ministerial office was 169 votes.
The inauguration ceremony for the newly elected premier is scheduled to take place today at the President House. All the necessary arrangements for the swearing-in have been finalised, and invitations have been dispatched.
The event is set to take place at Aiwan-e-Sadr at 3:00 p.m. where President Dr Arif Alvi will administer the oath to Shehbaz.
Sources from the President House confirmed that invitations have been distributed for the upcoming event. The swearing-in ceremony is expected to be attended by prominent figures, including the army chief, caretaker prime minister, Senate chairman, National Assembly Speaker and governors as well as chief ministers of all four provinces.

Shehbaz, the PML-N president and the newly-stitched coalition’s candidate for prime minister, has returned to the role he held till August 2023, when the National Assembly completed a five-year term for the third consecutive time in over seven-decade-old political history of the country.
Amid rigging allegations and in the face of massive economic challenges, the newly-elected premier vowed to steer the country out of crisis and set the goal for his government to make Pakistan a member of G20 countries by 2030.
The G20, formed in 1999, is a group of 20 of many of the world’s largest economies that meets regularly to coordinate global policy on trade, health, climate, and other issues. It consists of 19 countries as well as the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU).
The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.
In his maiden address, Shehbaz acknowledged the alarming debt crisis and promised to make Pakistan ""self-sufficient."" He spoke of necessary surgery on the system, embracing basic reforms to cut the chains of debt enslavement.
""We will rise, and we will make Pakistan self-sufficient,"" he proclaimed.
Referring to the economy, Shehbaz said that the incoming government would bring investment into the country and create economic conditions to spur growth, emphasising that “one window” export zones will be established in all provinces.Hitting at his opponents, Shehbaz while recalling that PML-N was thrown out thrice said his party could never even think of bringing any harm to the country, unlike his opponents, saying they put the entire opposition behind bars and used language that cannot be uttered out loud.
Claiming that his party and leadership never thought of the politics of revenge, Shehbaz recalled that the country saw a day when GHQ, corps commander houses, and airfields were attacked on May 9, saying such events were unforgettable.

Shehbaz left nothing to the imagination when he said that the perpetrators of the May 9 riots would not be forgiven as action against all those who were involved in the attack on state installations would be taken.
Meanwhile, he promised that his government would put an end to terrorism and its roots once and for all, revealing his aim was to take the National Action Plan forward.
He maintained that the people of Pakistan were suffering the burden of sky-high electricity and gas prices, emphasising that the “electricity and tax thefts are a matter of life and death for Pakistan. “It is difficult and a long and thorny journey full of hurdles, but countries that surmounted these challenges became one of the most prosperous nations around the world,” he said.
Shehbaz said that he would bring a technological model to reduce tax theft, which he maintained, would “reduce inflation, increase employment, the country will grow”. He also promised subsidies for farmers and said a package on solar tube wells would be soon announced.

He promised that the “seed mafia” would soon be eliminated and Pakistan would import seeds from the best countries in the world to provide them to farmers. He added that the federal government would work with all provinces in the agriculture sector.
Shehbaz also said efficient public transport and state-of-the-art hospitals and medical facilities will be provided to the people. Referring to the justice system, he said the government would work on introducing a system through which the people will get swift justice, announcing that the women and children, who are currently serving sentences that are less than two years, will be freed.

He also called out the international community for its deafening silence and inaction on the situation in Gaza and held Kashmir. While urging all to come together, he called upon passing a resolution for the freedom of Kashmiris and Palestinians. He further said that the issue of the missing persons should end now as peace cannot be established in Balochistan without solving it.

3,Unsung heroes ‘overlooked’ in Ichhra Bazaar rescue,Shopkeeper risked life to shield woman; low-ranking police officials lament 'discrimination',"While ASP Gulberg Shehrbano Naqvi received well-deserved accolades for her role in averting a tragedy fuelled by blasphemy allegations, the spotlight has seemed to inadvertently dim the heroic actions of other unsung figures who risked life and property.
Among the silent champions, a shopkeeper and two courageous salesmen played a crucial role in shielding the woman from an angry mob before the police could arrive.
Johnson Tariq, the quick-thinking owner of a food point, took the bold move to secure the woman within his shop as the belligerent mob outside clamoured to chop her into pieces. Meanwhile, two salesmen formed a human chain, attempting to calm the approaching mob that sought to breach the shop, even risking arson.
The incident unfolded when a frenzy erupted outside a shop in Ichhra Bazaar, triggered by an allegation that a woman's shirt bore Quranic verses, leading to cries of ""blasphemy.""
As per the details, the woman, wearing the shirt, was strolling through the bazaar with her husband when a man, noticing the Arabic calligraphy, began following the couple, eventually intercepting the woman near Pakistan Chowk, demanding she change her shirt.
When she asked him to leave and do his own job, the man persisted and, at one point, even attempted to strip her of the shirt. In reaction, she shouted at him and cried out for help. The situation escalated, leading to a large crowd charging towards the woman upon hearing allegations of blasphemy.
Seeking refuge in a nearby food point, the woman faced a volatile mob, with one suspect brandishing a knife, threatening harm.
In no time, the entire street was galvanised against the woman with tensions reaching crescendo over her refusal to remove the shirt and charges of blasphemy.
Sensing the escalating tension, she sought refuge in a nearby eatery. The unruly mob was spiralling out of control, unleashing vehement threats. A perpetrator emerged, brandishing a sharp-edged knife, menacingly vowing to dismember the victim, accusing her of affronting the religious sentiments of Muslims.
Wisely, Johnson Tariq, the shop owner, swiftly lowered the shutter and secured it from within. Despite the mob's menacing threats to set the shop ablaze, two salesmen valiantly stood guard outside.
Simultaneously, the police arrived and intervened to bring the situation under control.
Prior to ASP Shehrbano's arrival, an ASI from Ichra Police, followed by SHO Bilal Ahmad, had already secured the premises. SP Model Town Irtaza Komail, accompanied by police officials from nearby stations, had also arrived at the scene to support senior officers in managing the law-and-order situation.
However, beneath the surface, a wave of discontent swelled among the police ranks. ASP Shehrbano received official accolades, while the efforts of the rank-and-file, particularly the shopkeeper and salesmen, went unnoticed.
Allegations of discrimination against rankers by the PSP cadre dominated the department, echoing a longstanding norm where rankers undertook groundwork, only for PSP officers to claim credit and accolades.
According to a low-ranking officer, the disparity was due to discriminatory practices against lower-ranking personnel by the predominant PSP cadre within the department.
Traditionally, he lamented, the norm within the department involved rankers carrying out the groundwork, while the PSP members received nominations for awards and medals, often claiming credit for the work done by their subordinates.
The story behind registration of FIR
The drama continued at the police station, where the mob insisted on filing an FIR against the woman, claiming an offence despite the Arabic calligraphy. Local religious leaders demanded a public apology, captured in a video officially released in the presence of ASP Shehrbano and other officers.
Reluctant due to potential backlash, the police hesitated to take any action nor register a case, only doing so after intervention from top government authorities, particularly the newly elected government.
It is pertinent to note that PML-N leaders, including Khawaja Saad Rafique, have promised strict action against such incidents during their election campaigns.
During its previous term, the PML-N had to endure the brunt of such elements, facing multiple attacks and humiliations as their leaders were accused of playing a role in a bill aimed at amending blasphemy laws.
The gravity of the issue was reportedly recognised within the military top brass, spurred by recent incidents, including a smear campaign on social media against a former chief of army staff and a TLP's long march to Islamabad over the blasphemy issue.
This occurred just ahead of the appointment of a new army chief and the change of DG ISI.
In response, an FIR has been filed against five nominated accused persons and hundreds of unidentified suspects. The case has been sealed and subsequently transferred to the investigations wing for further examination.

4,Shehbaz on course to easy win in PM vote,NA speaker rejects SIC’s Omar Ayub objection to alliance’s candidate for premiership,"The forecast may be cloudy for Sunday, but PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif is poised for a political sunrise, expected to assume the mantle of the country's next prime minister, just 24 days after the ‘controversial’ general elections.
At a time when the country is close to seeing the formation of a new federal government, rigging allegations have cast a shadow over the country’s political landscape, leading to intensified tensions between former allies, the PML-N and the JUI-F.
Attempts at finding common ground between the two have proven challenging, even with PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif's charm offensive failing to sway JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to support his brother, Shehbaz Sharif. Instead, Maulana Fazlur Rehman has opted to skip the election altogether, embarking on a three-day visit to Karachi.
Meanwhile, the PTI was protesting against the alleged rigging in the polls. Its candidate for the prime minister’s slot, Omar Ayub Khan, submitted his nomination papers to the NA secretariat from the platform of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for the post.
In addition, he submitted an objection over Shehbaz’s nomination papers to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, claiming that the PML-N leader had lost the election in his constituency -- NA-123 (Lahore-VII) but was declared victorious after manipulation in Form-47.
He added that therefore, Shehbaz was ‘ineligible’ for the post of the premier. The NA speaker has approved the papers of both the candidates for the PM’s slot.
Knowing that the alliance of the PML-N, the PPP, the MQM-P and other parties has a clear numerical strength in the NA, the PTI while learning lessons from the past --especially after seeing the stunning results of the recent general elections despite being cornered -- has decided not to leave the battlefield empty and give a walkover to the other side.
While lending legitimacy to the emerging government, this development simultaneously completes a full circle in the broader political context. After the 2018 general elections, Shehbaz said that his party was participating in parliamentary politics as a form of protest. In 2024, the PTI finds itself in the National Assembly, aligning with the SIC, citing similar reasons.
As far as the numbers are concerned, the newly-stitched ruling alliance has a clear majority to form the government in the Centre.
Currently, the votes of 169 out of the total 336 members of the NA are required to elect the premier and form the government.
It became evident during the elections for the speaker and his deputy a day earlier that the PMLN-led alliance had 199 votes -- 30 more than required -- to clinch the office of the prime minister. The PTI-SIC candidates received 90-plus votes.
The election for the post of the premier is scheduled to be held on Sunday (today) at 11am. The premier is elected by MNAs in accordance with the Second Schedule of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007.
As per the NA rules, before the voting commences, the speaker shall direct that the bells be rung for five minutes to enable the members not present in the chamber to reach there.
Immediately after the bells stop ringing, all the entrances in the lobby will be locked. The assembly staff posted at each entrance will not allow entry or exit through them until the voting has concluded.
Then the speaker will read out to the House the names of the validly nominated candidates, who have not withdrawn in the order in which their nomination papers were received and proceed to hold the poll in accordance with the procedure set out in the Second Schedule.
After that, the speaker will ask the members to pass in a single file through the entrance where the tellers will be posted to record their votes.
On reaching the desk of the tellers, each member will, in turn, call out the division number allotted to them under the rules.
The tellers will then mark off their number on the division list, simultaneously calling out the name of the member.
In order to ensure that their vote has been properly recorded, the member will not move off until they have clearly heard the teller call out their name.
After a member has recorded their vote, they will not return to the chamber until the bells are rung.
At the end, when the speaker finds that all the members, who wished to participate in the polling process, have recorded their votes, he will announce that the voting has concluded.
Later, the NA secretary will ensure the collection of the division list, count the recorded votes, and present the result to the speaker. The speaker will then order that the bells be rung for two minutes to enable the members to return to the chamber. After the bells stop ringing, the speaker will announce the result to the House.
Once the votes are tallied, if there is only one contesting candidate and they secure the votes of the majority of the total membership of the assembly, the speaker shall declare them to have been elected as the leader of the house or the prime minister.
However, if there is only one contesting candidate and they fail to secure the votes of the majority of the total membership of the assembly, all proceedings will commence afresh. If there are two or more contesting candidates and none of them secures a majority in the first election, a second poll will be held between those who bagged the two highest numbers of votes in the first one.
The candidate, who secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting, will be declared to have been elected as the prime minister.
However, if the number of votes secured by two or more candidates bagging the most is equal, another election will be held between them until one of them secures a majority.
Seeing the number game in the NA, Shehbaz is set to become the premier again. He served as the premier after the then-prime minister Imran Khan was ousted through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022.

In another incident, two girls died and as many were injured when the roof of the house of Sherzaman collapsed in the Sakhakot area.
Further, the Garam Chashma Road has been closed to all traffic due to the heavy snow, stranding around 40,000 people and cutting them off from other parts of Chitral.
Heavy snowfall continued in Chitral and its suburban areas throughout the night, with two to three inches accumulating in Chitral City since Thursday. Meanwhile, up to two feet of snow was recorded along the Loweri Tunnel Road. After two days of continuous rain, snow began falling across Upper and Lower Chitral districts. The snow has intensified the bitter cold, with markets unusually quiet and traffic sparse on roads. Authorities have warned residents to avoid unnecessary travel to steer clear of avalanches and landslides.
In the Kailash Valley areas of Bomburit, Barir Rambur, and Shekhanandeh, up to two feet of snow has accumulated. Over two feet of snowfall also hit Midgalshit, where avalanches have damaged the road in multiple locations.
Meanwhile, heavy rains, which have been continuing for the last one week across Balochistan, paralysed life in 22 out of 35 districts of the province.
An incident in Kharan resulted in the loss of three lives, two among them children.
The situation in Gwadar and Kech districts of Makran was the worst as hundreds of houses collapsed, rendering a large number of families homeless.
Makran and other districts were completely cut off from other parts of the province due to damaged highways and inter-district roads.
The non-stop rains also cut off rail and road links between Pakistan and Iran as railway tracks between Noshki and Dalbandin were washed away by floodwater and a bridge at Coastal Highway near Pleary area of Gwadar was damaged.
Further, traffic between Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan and Islamabad was suspended when heavy rains triggered landslides blocking the highway near the Dhanasar area of Sherani district of Balochistan.
Gwadar, experiencing heavy rain, faced challenges as the drainage system and rescue infrastructure were severely affected, prompting residents to seek safer locations.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on Saturday announced the suspension of flight operations at Gwadar Airport until Tuesday.
According to a private news channel, the decision came in response to the flood situation in Gwadar, as stated by the CAA spokesperson.
A new notice has been issued, confirming the suspension of flight operations at Gwadar airport until Tuesday.
Earlier, the Balochistan government had declared a state of emergency and declared Gwadar a calamity-hit area following heavy rains that caused significant damage in the city.
In Sibi and nearby areas, heavy rains persisted for 14 hours, leading to rising water levels in rivers and canals.
The irrigation department issued a high alert, urging emergency rescue teams to be prepared for any unfortunate situation.
The heavy rain and snowfall sweep disrupted daily life and caused tragic incidents in various parts of Pakistan.
According to a private news channel report, from Lahore to Balochistan, Karachi, and the northern mountainous areas, the country faced a myriad of challenges due to the adverse weather conditions.
A day earlier, authorities declared a 'rain emergency' in Karachi as several parts of the province were in the grip of unpredictable weather.
In Lahore, light rain was reported in Gulberg, Lahore Cantonment, Lakshmi Chowk, and on Mall Road on Friday.
Johar Town, Defence, Canal Road, Thokar Niaz Baig, Wahdat Road, and surrounding areas also witnessed rainfall.
The cascade of rain extended beyond Lahore, with cities in Punjab such as Kasur, Muridke, Phoolnagar, Sharaqpur and Jhang experiencing downpours.
Tragically, the heavy rains proved fatal for three people in Kamalia, where a dilapidated house collapsed.
Additionally, northern mountainous areas, including Azad Kashmir, witnessed intermittent rain and snowfall, leading to a drop in temperatures.
However, the possibility of highway blockades due to snowfall and landslides looms large.
According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department, as the country grapples with the unprecedented weather conditions, citizens were urged to exercise caution, and emergency services were on high alert to respond to any untoward situation.
Pakistan Army started rescue operations following the heavy snowfall in the areas around Lowari Tunnel, Kalam, Chitral and Malam Jabba.
