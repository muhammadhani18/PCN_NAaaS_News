Taking notice of the growing complaints about unchecked environmental pollution caused by the manufacturers in the economic zone, the district & sessions judge consumer and commercial disputes court on Saturday directed the authorities concerned to compel the industrialists to install air pollution control system.
Through a letter sent to the HEZ chairman, District & Sessions Judge/Consumer/Commercial Disputes Court, Haripur, Muneera Abbasi pointed out that steel mills and factories in the HEZ were the major contributors of environmental pollution caused mostly by use of tyre powder and oil. 
The letter pointed out that these factories avoided using natural gas to save production costs, thus compromising the human life and health insurance.
The judge pointed out that due to frequent burning of tyres and their oil in the furnaces of steel mills and other factories the life of residents of surrounding localities, wildlife, passersby and workers and officers of factories was at risk due to health hazards.
The judge asked the chairman HEZ to ensure that the units creating environmental pollution stopped the practice. 
The judge also advised him to appoint a monitoring officer from his office, who should liaise with the registrar of her court, director Environment Protection Agency and assistant director industries, Haripur, to launch an effective drive against the polluters.
She also directed the chairman HEZ to make the industrialists to ensure that their air pollution control system was functional, and the industrialists, who had not yet installed the system, must be forced to do so.
The Hattar industrialists are accused of using the old tyres and oil extracted by processing the unusable tyres in the furnaces of steel mills and some other factories, causing respiratory complications to workers, passersby and residents of neighbouring localities. 
The local media has drawn the attention of EPA and local authorities to the grave issue many a time, but to no avail.
The industrialists are also held responsible for causing water pollution, but environmental culprits are yet to be punished.

1,"Prices of vegetables, fruits surge in Mansehra ahead of Ramazan",Residents flay price control body over ‘failure to deliver’,"MANSEHRA: Prices of vegetables and fruits have surged significantly before the advent of Ramazan in Mansehra.
“Rates of essential kitchen items and fruits have experienced a significant spike in recent days as the district administration is yet to initiate preemptive measures before the start of Ramazan,” Ajmal Khan, a local resident said.
He decried the sudden jump in rates of essential items in the local markets, saying if the district administration didn’t take measures to curtail the soaring prices the people would experience the highest-ever inflation in the fasting month.
Mr Khan said the price control and review committee at its meeting held the other day couldn’t bring prices of essential commodities down, putting an extra financial burden on the pockets of consumers.

Residents flay price control body over ‘failure to deliver’

Another local, Zeeshan Khan, said butchers were already receiving high prices for beef, but the price control body had further enhanced it rates. “The China garlic, which was sold at Rs400 per kilogramme earlier this week, has now experienced a sudden surge in its price and is being sold at Rs600 per kg,” he said.
The rates issued jointly by the food, revenue departments and wholesalers revealed a sudden rise in vegetable and fruit prices.
Potato, which was sold at Rs50 per kg, is now being sold at Rs70 per kg.
Price of onion surged to Rs200 from Rs170 per kg, tomato to Rs130 from Rs100 per kg and okra to Rs220 from Rs180 per kg.
Prices of fruits increased significantly as bananas are being sold at Rs200 per dozen and oranges at Rs300 per dozen.
RECEPTION PARTY: MNA Shahzada Gustasab Khan on Saturday said he would make all-out efforts to address the issues facing the people of his NA-15 constituency.
“I would work for the uplift of the people of my constituency,” he said while speaking at a reception hosted in his honour in Shinkiari town. The jubilant Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf workers received Mr Khan on his arrival here from Islamabad for the first time after taking oath as MNA.
“My rival party made all possible bids to block notification of my victory, but the Election Commission of Pakistan decided the case on merit and set aside petition moved by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo Nawaz Sharif seeking withholding of final results,” he said.
Mr Khan said his constituency was stretched over rural parts of Mansehra and neighbouring Torghar district. “The people of Torghar are without civic necessities and I would ensure that all development projects announced by the federal government in the past are executed,” Mr Khan said.
Meanwhile, Laiq Mohammad Khan, who joined PTI after being elected MPA from Torghar’s only provincial assembly constituency as an independent, said health and other projects inaugurated by him in the last government would be completed.
“I have ordered initiation of work on the Kotkay Bridge at a cost of Rs10 billion, which would link Torghar with Peshawar,” he told reporters.
Mr Khan said with the construction of the bridge the distance between Torghar and Peshawar would be reduced significantly.

3,Action sought against PTI workers for ‘throwing’ shoe in KP Assembly,PML-N's Amir Muqam says party will move FIA if FIR not registered.,"PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has submitted an application to the police for the registration of an FIR against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf workers for throwing a shoe and a lota at its woman lawmaker, Sobia Shahid, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Feb 20.
PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam told reporters at the Peshawar Press Club on Saturday that the PTI workers, who were involved in the incident, also shouted slogans and used derogatory language against the woman lawmaker.
He said that the Feb 20 incident showed that the PTI workers didn’t know how to behave when it came to women.
“The PTI had invited goons to the assembly who disrespected opposition members, particularly women. The PTI violated the sanctity of the house,” he said.

Muqam says party will move FIA if FIR not registered

Mr Muqam demanded of the assembly’s speaker to take action over the “attack” on the woman MPA.
Accompanied by lawmaker Sobia Shahid, PML-N Women’s Wing provincial general secretary Farah Khan and other office-bearers, the party leader said that what happened in the newly-elected provincial assembly in its maiden session was regrettable.
“Why do you take this thing [opposition] to enmity? If you’re given so many seats in the provincial assembly, what else do you want?”
Mr Muqam said that it was a serious matter and should be investigated immediately.
He said that the incident had brought dishonour on the entire province.
“We have video clips to prove that bottles and hashish were thrown at Shobia Shahid in the assembly. Whoever is involved in this should be arrested and punished,” he said.
The PML-N leader said that on one hand, the PTI’s lawmakers were protesting to claim assembly seats reserved for women and non-Muslims, but on the other, the party called the assembly’s session showing its double standard.
He said the Federal Investigation Agency should investigate the incident if the local police didn’t register an FIR against the shoe- and lota-throwers in the assembly.
“Having the majority in the house doesn’t mean that you’re not to tolerate the opposition. Political things should not turn into personal enmity.
We have submitted an application to the police [Sharqi police station] for the registration of FIR for action against those who threw a shoe and a lota at MPA Sobia Shahid and will also approach the FIA for it,“ he said.
Mr Muqam said that the newly-elected provincial chief minister should announce plans for the people’s development instead of giving an ultimatum to the police for the release of those detained over the May 9–10 violent protests.

Talking to reporters on Saturday, they said that the urban and the adjoining rural areas were hard hit by unannounced and prolonged spells of electricity and gas outages, troubling the business community to a great extent. 
They said that women suffered the most due to prolonged breakdowns of power and gas supply.
“On one hand people have been subjected to face the brunt of increase in power and gas tariffs, and on the other, they are being deprived of gas and electricity facilities,” Arshad Khan, a traders’ leader, deplored.
He said that paying utility bills had become a hard nut to crack for poor consumers owing to frequent hikes in gas and electricity prices.
Karim Khan, a civil society activist, said that people were forced to pay inflated bills of utilities but the service providing companies were unable to ensure smooth power and gas supply to them.
“During the last over one year, the government enhanced prices of electricity and gas many times,” he maintained, deploring that loadshedding duration had also increased in the southern district.
They said that there was no check and balance on local authorities of power and gas supply companies, that was why they were involved in carrying out gas and electricity outages to cover losses caused by their poor performance.
The traders said that power shutdowns had badly impacted their businesses, leaving them with no option but to come onto the streets to record a protest.
They asked the government to take notice of ‘unjustified and unfair’ electricity and gas breakdowns and direct local authorities concerned to ensure smooth supply of these critical utilities.

11,Resumption of Sehat Card Plus on cards as govt agrees to clear dues of State Life,"Official says SLIC to get Rs5bn next week, Rs3bn every month afterwards","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has agreed to pay Rs5 billion to the State Life Insurance Corporation next week for the resumption of the health insurance programme Sehat Card Plus in the province from the first day of Ramazan.
“The government has agreed to pay Rs5 billion next week and Rs3 billion every month afterwards to the State Life [Insurance Corporation],” CEO of the Sehat Card Plus Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli told Dawn.
He said newly-elected Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur and finance department bosses were informed about the due SCPpayment of Rs17 billion to the SLIC for the restoration of the health insurance programme.
Dr Tanoli said first, 85 per cent of the SCP services would resume, while the rest, including liver and renal transplants, implants of artificial limbs, and some surgical procedures, would be included in the programme after the cabinet’s approval.

Official says SLIC to get Rs5bn next week, Rs3bn every month afterwards

He said only dialysis, cancer, and emergency services had been available to those entitled to the SCP since Oct 19, 2023, taking the costs down from Rs3 billion a month to just Rs300m per month.
The CEO said the SCP was pioneered by the PTI’s government towards the end of 2015 with a population of three per cent population in four selected districts, but it was later extended to the entire population in phases.
“Until now, three million people have benefitted from the programme with women (54pc) outnumbering men (46pc). A total of 10.2m families, or 33.2m people, are registered for free treatment on the basis of their national identity cards registered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Each family is eligible to avail itself of healthcare up to Rs10m per year,” he said.
Dr Tanoli said the government had so far spent Rs76.5bn on the health insurance programme covering most of the diseases requiring hospitalisation.
He said of the amount incurred on free healthcare, 60pc went to private hospitals and 40pc to public sector ones. On average, Rs28,500 is spent on a patient,” he said.
The CEO said after the first Ramazan, all secondary and selected tertiary care services under the SCP would resume at 119 empaneled hospitals in the province.
“We can later increase the number of empaneled hospitals, for which we will wait for the policy board’s meeting. It will be possible only after the notification of the health minister,” he said.
Dr Tanoli said until now, 159 kidney transplants were carried out under the programme with the cost of every procedure totalling around Rs1.4m.
He said a total of 64 people got liver transplants, with each surgery costing Rs5m. The CEO said 169,107 cardiac procedures, 530,041 dialysis, and 54,710 chemotherapy sessions were also performed under the SCP.
Meanwhile, the representatives of public sector hospitals hailed the government’s move to clear the SLIC’s dues for the resumption of the health insurance programme.
They said the Lady Reading Hospital was waiting for the SLIC to pay it Rs2bn for the treatment of those entitled to the SCP, while the Peshawar Institute of Cardiology also expected its unpaid amount of Rs1.5bn.
The Hayatabad Medical Complex and Khyber Teaching Hospital await payment of Rs600m and Rs500m each from the insurer. These four major hospitals have stopped services on the SCP due to non-payment of dues by the SLIC.
Sources said the SLIC didn’t make any payments to the hospitals in the last six months as it wasn’t receiving dues from the government.
They said not only big hospitals but the insurance company, too, had to clear the dues of district hospitals to ensure the continuation of their services.
“We are ready to start free healthcare after the assurance of regular payments by the new government. We hope that the programme will have smooth sailing like in the past when PTI ruled the province,” a hospital’s representative told Dawn.
He said non-payment of funds by the caretakers limited services under the health insurance scheme to emergency patients only.

Elders of the Shahi Banda village told Dawn that women both from the area and far-flung localities carried their babies with disabilities through the natural narrow passageway firmly believing that the exercise will turn the infants healthy.
The elders said that the women also tied colourful pieces of cloth to the branches of a nearby tree hoping that their desires would come true.
Elder Abdul Basit said that the people brought babies with disabilities to the passageway for cure. 
He said that the miracle site was destroyed with the help of hammers.
The elder said that though young, educated people were opposed to superstitions, the elderly, especially women, still believed them.
