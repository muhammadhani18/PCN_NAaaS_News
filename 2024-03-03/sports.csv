1,Cleanliness drive kicks off in Pindi,Duties assigned to sanitary workers for citywide campaign,"A cleanliness drive has been kicked off in Rawalpindi under the Clean Punjab campaign to remove garbage from open spaces, vegetable markets, bus terminals, and graveyards.
Rawalpindi Commissioner Engineer Aamir Khattak said the drive had been launched as per the instructions of the newly-elected Punjab chief minister.
He visited different areas of Rawalpindi city to review the cleanliness situation amid the current rain spell.
He visited Committee Chowk Underpass, Waris Khan Circle Road and Itwar Bazaar Committee Chowk Dumping Point. While reviewing the flow of rainwater on the Goalmandi Bridge, he directed to ensure timely measures for drainage of rainwater. He directed Saddar assistant commissioner to identify space for a separate transfer site in urban union councils within the next three days.
There is only one transfer station in the city which is the biggest obstacle in maintaining cleanliness, he added and further said that separate transfer stations will reduce transport costs and increase efficiency. He directed to pay special attention to the cleanliness campaign, and the complaints received should be resolved immediately.
“Apart from this, the city should be divided into zones for cleanliness. It will become easier to cater zone-wise cleaning and this will also improve its quality.” The Rawalpindi commissioner said the Punjab chief minister has adopted zero zero-tolerance stance regarding cleanliness. He further directed that an immediate summary be moved to increase the scope of RWMC, highlighting the lack of machinery and other resources so that it may not create any hindrance in the drive.
Chairman RWMC Saqib Rafiq and other officers concerned also accompanied him during the visit to different areas of the city early in the morning.

4,Sasta Ramazan Bazaar in limbo,"Official sees no visible progress regarding setup of stalls, parking lots","As the holy month of Ramazan is just two weeks away, Rawalpindi faces a setback as the traditional setup of 16 Sasta Ramazan Bazaars and 23 Sasta Ramazan Cart Markets hangs in uncertainty.
For the first time in 45 years, the prospect of no Sasta Ramazan bazaars raises concerns among citizens, leaving them vulnerable to the profiteering practices in the open market.
The Deputy Commissioner (DC) has not yet called a meeting for the establishment of Sasta Ramazan Bazaars, hindering the issuance of tenders for necessary equipment such as tents, chairs, tables, baskets, CCTV cameras, and canopies. The District Market Committee has also lagged in preparations, with only eleven days remaining until the start of the Ramazan.
The schedule for security duties in the bazaars remains unprepared, and no visible progress has been made regarding the setup of stalls and parking spaces in the customary locations. The Acting Chairman of the District Market Committee confirmed the lack of effort this time and highlighted the absence of any official notification or meeting by the district administration on the matter.
The Civil Defense Office, responsible for duty schedules of volunteers in the bazaars, has not yet received the roster.
This longstanding tradition of Sasta Ramazan Bazaars in Rawalpindi was started by former President General Ziaul Haq in 1979 and afterwards, every government continued to set up these bazaars during their tenure, but this time, for the first time Rawalpindi will be deprived of this facility.
Financial constraints pose a significant challenge this year, preventing the provision of subsidies on fruits, vegetables, and groceries in Ramazan bazaars.
District administration sources revealed that due to the severe financial crisis, a final decision on establishing a Ramazan bazaar is pending, awaiting guidance from the new Punjab government.
