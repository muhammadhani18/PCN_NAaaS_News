5,"Over 90% of rainwater drained, says CBC","More than 150 pumps, ranging from 5.5 to 75hp were used during the operation","The Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) administration has claimed that 90% of rainwater has been drained out from Clifton and DHA areas. Following Friday’s heavy rain, CBC teams continued their efforts on Saturday, focusing on cleaning secondary roads such as Cross Avenue, Shehbaz Street, Commercial Avenue 4, etc.
Assistant Engineer Imran Ahmed Khan, head of storm water at CBC, told the media that Clifton and some low-lying areas of DHA often experience waterlogging during winter and monsoon rains. Despite the recent rains, there was minimal deterioration reported. However, due to water flowing from the elevation of Cross Avenue Khayaban-e-Shahbaz towards the decline, rainwater accumulated in certain areas.
