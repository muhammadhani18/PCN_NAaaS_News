0,UK PM Sunak rails against ‘extremism’ after Galloway’s win,"""There is no ‘context’ in which it can be acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes onto Big Ben in the middle of a vote on Israel/Gaza,"" says Sunak.","LONDON: For the first time since he became prime minister 16 months earlier, Rishi Sunak made an impromptu speech from outside his office, not to call a general election but to rail against extremist groups, which, according to him, are trying to tear the nation apart.
Standing in the rain, his back to 10 Downing Street, PM Sunak in speech to the nation on Friday night said: “There is no ‘context’ in which it can be acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes onto Big Ben in the middle of a vote on Israel/Gaza. And there can be no cause you can use to justify the support of a proscribed terrorist group, like Hamas. Yes, you can freely criticise the actions of this government, or indeed any government: that is a fundamental democratic right. But no, you cannot use that as an excuse to call for the eradication of a state — or any kind of hatred or antisemitism.”
After months of pro-Gaza public demonstrations and growing pressure on both the government and Labour party to take a tougher stance on Israel, it appears that the victory of George Galloway in a by-election in the erstwhile Labour stronghold of Rochdale is the straw that broke the camel’s back.
He won with overwhelming numbers that night, beating both the Labour and Tory candidate by wide margins.

UK PM calls victory of far-left candidate ‘alarming’

A much-loathed figure in British politics for his populist rhetoric, pro-Gaza Galloway lured Rochdale’s Muslim voters through a targeted campaign centering on Gaza and the British government’s silence on Israel’s continued bombardment.
His victory was painted by Sunak as a crisis for Britain’s democracy. Sunak said, “…it is beyond alarming that last night the Rochdale by-election returned a candidate… who dismisses the horror of what happened on October 7th, who glorifies Hezbollah…”
His remarks come just days after the House of Commons Gaza vote ended in chaos, with the speaker breaking protocol after claims that MPs felt threatened to vote a certain way.
Though there are some in and outside his party that applauded Sunak’s speech, including Sajid Javed who called it “powerful” and Labour leader Keir Starmer who said the PM was right to condemn “intimidatory behaviour”, there were many left questioning it.
In an interview to Geo News, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan hit the nail on the head when he asked, “When there is any incident of antisemitism we say that it is wrong and antisemitic. We also condemn misogyny and sexism. Then why is it that when Pakistani origin Britons and Muslims are attacked, nobody says that it is Islamophobic and anti-Muslim?”
The Guardian wrote in a report, “He [Sunak] painted a picture of political bedlam which some opponents argue is overstated.”
It added, “The address contained no new policies, beyond a vague commitment for a ‘robust framework’ for government to tackle extremism at its roots.”
English television presenter Matthew Wright said on LBC, “Whenever he had to choose an example of an extremist, he went with Palestinian peace marchers rather than some of the hate peddlers on his own benches.”
Writing for Socialist Worker, Thomas Foster said Rishi Sunak’s speech on ‘extremism’ is a sign of Tory panic. “The Palestine movement has shaken up British politics.”
Taj Ali, co-editor of Tribune Magazine, said, “Rishi Sunak is talking about division, about nasty politics. What we’ve seen from his party is the demonisation of British Muslims who are disproportionately working class, they care about housing, NHS, child poverty, which is 40pc in places like Rochdale.”
Commentator Owen Jones remarked, “A moral panic is whipped up against dissenting voices, who are portrayed as dangerous extremists who threaten the social order and national unity, and who are fifth columns for foreign enemies.”

1,Many aid distribution victims were shot in Gaza: UN,11 killed as airstrike hits tent in Rafah; Hamas-Israel talks set to continue in Cairo.,"GAZA CITY: A UN team has reported seeing “a large number” of gunshot wounds among Gazans after Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinian civilians scrambling for food supplies near an aid convoy, killing 115 people and wounded more than 750. 
The aid convoy deaths pushed the number of Palestinian dead in Gaza since Oct 7 to 30,320, mostly women and children. Hossam Abu Safiya, director of Gaza City’s Kamal Adwan Hospital, said all the casualties it admitted were hit by “bullets and shrapnel from (Israeli) occupation forces”.
There are contradictions within the Israeli claims; BBC News reported that officials first claimed that “dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling” during looting, then saying that tanks in the area “tried to disperse the mob with a few warning shots”.
In a video statement posted on X, the Israeli armed forces spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari claimed: “Hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand.”

11 killed as airstrike hits tent in Rafah; Hamas-Israel talks set to continue in Cairo

A UN team visited some of the wounded from the aid incident, in  Gaza City’s Al Shifa Hospital, on Friday and saw a “large number of  gunshot wounds”, a spoke­sperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres said. 
The hospital received 70 of the dead, and around 200 wounded were still there during the team’s visit. 
11 Palestinians killed   
Separately, at least 11 Palestinians were killed on Saturday when an Israeli air strike hit a tent in Rafah, in Gaza’s south where people have been seeking refuge from Israel’s devastating bombardment. 
Another 50 people were wounded in the strike next to a hospital in the Tel Al Sultan area of Rafah. One of the dead was a medic at the hospital.  
“The strike hit one tent, where people took shelter, directly, shrapnel came inside the hospital where I and friends were sitting, we survived by a miracle,” a witness said by phone from the area. 
And in the territory’s north, three people searching for food in farmland in Beit Hanoun were killed by Israeli strikes. 
Ceasefire uncertainty
The killings came amid uncertainty over whether negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire would resume on Sunday. 
US President Joe Biden has said he hopes a ceasefire will be in place by the time Ramazan begins on March 10 or 11.  
Two Egyptian security sources said Israeli and Hamas delegations were expected to arrive in Cairo on Sunday to resume indirect talks. 
However, Israel’s Ynet news agency, citing an unnamed senior official, reported that Israel would not send a delegation to the Cairo talks until it received a full list of prisoners held in Gaza who were alive.

2,Seizure of commercial consignment draws FO ire,Indian agencies confiscated goods on Karachi-bound ship.,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Saturday issued a sharp rebuke in response to India’s interception and seizure of a commercial consignment en route to Pakistan, labelling the action as an “unjustified seizure” and criticising India’s self-assumed role as a regional enforcer.
“Pakistan condemns India’s high-handedness in seizure of commercial goods. This disruption of free trade underscores the dangers inherent in the arbitrary assumption of policing roles by states with dubious credentials,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said.
Her comments came after media reports about the interception by India on Jan 23 of a Malta-flagged merchant vessel, CMA CGM Attila, near Mumbai’s Nhava Sheva port. The Karachi-bound ship from China was boarded, and its cargo was inspected based on what Indians claimed to be specific intelligence inputs.
Indian customs officials, according to statements made to Indian media, found an Italian-made computer numerical control (CNC) machine within the consignment, alleging its potential utility in nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and subsequently confiscated it.

Indian agencies confiscated goods on Karachi-bound ship

Ms Baloch clarified that the item in question was “a commercial lathe machine”. The intended recipient of the seized machinery has been identified as Cosmos Engineering, a Karachi-based firm that manufactures automobile parts and home appliances.
The consignment was seized after the port officials had alerted the Indian defence authorities, who inspected the heavy cargo and reported their suspicions. Officials in India were quoted as saying that the seizure fell under the “prevention of possible proliferation by Pakistan and China”.
According to Indian media reports, documents such as the bill of lading and other consignment details purportedly showed that the consigner was Shanghai JXE Global Logistics Co Ltd and weighed 22,180 kilograms.
“This is a simple case of import of a commercial lathe machine by a Karachi-based commercial entity, which supplies parts to the automobile industry in Pakistan,” Ms Baloch elaborated. “Speci­fications of the equipment clearly indicate its purely commercial use. The transaction was being conducted through transparent banking channels with all the relevant documentation.”
Criticising the Indian action, she remarked, “Such acts also highlight the growing impunity of certain states in violating international norms and taking arbitrary measures in violation of international law.”

3,Calls for probe into Sikh singer’s killing in US,"Raj Sindh, also known as Goldy, was shot dead outside a gurdwara, Indian media reports.","WASHINGTON: A Sikh musician (ragi) was shot dead outside a gurdwara in the US city of Selma on Feb 23, making it the second killing of an Indian-origin person in less than a month.
Indian media reported this week that Raj Singh, also known as Goldy, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Selma, a city in the southern US state of Alabama.
However, it was later emerged that the shooting actually took place in another city of the same name in the state of California.
A Sikh website, Sikh Vox, called the murder “a chilling incident that has sent shockwaves through the Sikh community.”
Raj Singh, 29, “fell victim to what is suspected to be a hate-fueled attack outside the Selma gurdwara,” the website added.
According to reports, Mr Singh, hailing from Tanda Sahuwala village in Bijnor district of India’s Uttar Pradesh state, was part of a musical group and had been living in the US for one and a half years.
While Raj’s family members have urged the authorities to also look into racial or religious motives for the murder, Selma police have stated that there had been no indication of it being a hate crime.
Selma police have said that the shooting was linked to a car-jacking attempt and that it is being investigated.
In a statement, the police department said the search for suspect or suspects is underway and sought information from public.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has also supported the family’s demand.
“[B]ecause this shooting occurred near a house of worship, we urge state and federal law enforcement authorities to investigate this crime with the possibility of a bias motive in mind,” CAIR’s Communications Director Ibraham Hooper said in a statement.
The news of Raj’s demise has left the family in a state of shock and anguish.
“We were informed about the incident by relatives … We have reached out to the gurdwara committee for more information, and they are helping us. We have also appealed to our government for justice and the arrest of the killers,” Gurdeep Singh, the victim’s brother-in-law, told Times of India.
According to the Indian media, the victim was the only breadwinner of his family, and his father had died five years ago.
Days before Raj Singh was gunned down, Pravin Raojibhai Patel, a 76-year-old motel owner of Indian origin, was shot dead following an altercation with a customer over a room rental in Alabama on Feb 15.
The murder has again put the spotlight on the killings of the Sikh diaspora overseas.
In September 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian agents of being involved in the murder of a Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Reuters reported.
Mr Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a gurdwara on June 18 in Surrey, a suburb in Vancouver, three years after India had designated him as a “terrorist”.
Later that year, the US thwarted a plot to kill a Sikh separatist and warned India over concerns that the government in New Delhi was involved.

4,Germany probes possible wiretapping of secret Ukraine war talks,"In an audio recording, German army officers can be heard discussing strikes on Crimea.","BERLIN: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday promised a full investigation after what appe­ared to be a recording of confidential army talks on the Ukraine war was posted on Russian social media, in a potentially huge embarrassment for Berlin.
The head of Russia’s state-backed RT channel, Margarita Simonyan, on Friday posted the 38-minute audio recording of what Scholz claimed were German army officers on Feb 19 discussing striking Crimea.
“What is being reported is a very serious matter and that is why it is now being investigated very carefully, very intensively and very quickly,” Scholz said on a visit to Rome.
In the recording, discussions can be heard on the possible use by Ukrainian forces of German-made Taurus missiles and their potential impact.

In an audio recording, German army officers can be heard discussing strikes on Crimea

Topics include aiming the missiles at targets such as a key bridge over the Kerch strait linking the Russian mainland to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The discussions also cover the use of missiles provided to Kyiv by France and Britain.
Experts consulted by Der Spiegel magazine said they believed the recording was authentic.
A defence ministry spokeswoman said it was investigating “whether communications in the air force sector were intercepted”.
‘Sworn enemies’
Kyiv has long been clamouring for Germany to provide it with Taurus missiles, which can reach targets up to 500kms away.
Scholz has so far refused to send the missiles, fearing that it would lead to an escalation of the conflict.
“If this story turns out to be true, it would be a highly problematic event,” Green party politician Konstantin von Notz told the RND broadcaster.
“The question arises as to whether this is a one-off incident or a structural safety problem,” he added.
Speaking at a diplomatic forum in Turkiye on Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the recording indicates that Ukraine and its backers “do not want to change their course at all, and want to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield”.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakh­arova demanded that Germany “promptly” provide explanations for the discussion.
“Attempts to avoid answering the questions will be regarded as an admission of guilt,” she said.
“Our age-old rivals — the Germans — have again turned into our sworn enemies,” former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Security Council and the foreign ministry, wrote in a Telegram post.
Taurus missiles 
The acquisition of German Taurus missiles would provide a massive boost for Ukraine amid the ongoing war.
France and Britain have supplied Kyiv with SCALP or Storm Shadow missiles, both of which have a range of about 250kms, but Scholz said last week Germany could not justify matching British and French moves in sending long-range missiles to Ukraine and supporting the weapon system’s deployment.
“This is a very long-range weapon, and what the British and French are doing in terms of targeting and supporting targeting cannot be done in Germany,” Scholz said, without specifying exactly what he meant.
Britain denied that it had any direct involvement in operating the missiles.
“Ukraine’s use of Storm Shadow and its targeting processes are the business of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said.
However, Roderich Kiesewetter from Germany’s opposition conservatives warned that further recordings may also be leaked.
