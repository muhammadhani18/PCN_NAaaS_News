1,"Coleman trumps Lyles, Crouser adds to shot put medal haul","GLASGOW: Christian Coleman raced to his second global 60 metres title at the world indoor championships on Friday,...","GLASGOW: Christian Coleman raced to his second global 60 metres title at the world indoor championships on Friday, exploding out of the blocks with his reliably fast start to edge American team-mate Noah Lyl­es by three-hundredths of a second. 
The 27-year-old Coleman clocked 6.41 seconds, the world’s fastest time this season. 
“I had a lot of confidence in myself coming in, I set my mind on letting my body do what I have been doing in practice and I came out with a win,” Coleman said. “I can look forward to the rest of the summer [including the Paris Olympics].” 
Lyles, triple gold medallist at last summer’s outdoor worlds in Budapest, crossed in 6.44 in what he calls his weakest event. 
“It was a great run, to be honest, it’s probably one of my best runs,” said Lyles, a 100m and 200m specialist who usually does not hit top speed until the second half of his races. “I’ve never had an indoor season this great, I’ve never been to a world indoors. 
“It only makes me so much more excited because [the first 60m] is the worst part of my race. I’m ready to take this newfound 60 ability and put it into the 100.” 
Ackeem Blake of Jamaica took the bronze in 6.46. 
In a good night for the US team, double Olympic champion Ryan Crouser, also a two-time world outdoor gold medallist, improved on the world indoor silver he won in Belgrade two years ago with victory in the shot put. 
The American world record holder went out to a dominant 22.77 metres with his fifth effort, New Zealand’s Tom Walsh taking silver with 22.07m and Italy’s Leonardo Fabbri bronze (21.96). 
Noor Vidts of Belgium successfully defended her 2022 world indoor pentathlon title, climbing from the silver medal position into gold with a solid 800m, the pentathlon’s final event. Vidts scored 4,773, while Finland’s Saga Vanninen won silver with 4,677 and Sofie Dokter of the Netherlands was third (4,571). 
Olympic silver medallist Nicola Olyslagers of Australia cleared 1.99 metres on her final attempt to win the women’s high jump, ahead of the reigning outdoor champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh of Ukraine (1.97) and Lia Apostolovski of Slovenia (1.95). 
Canadian Sarah Mitten added a world gold to her collection by winning the women’s shot put earlier on Friday in the first final of the meet. 
The 27-year-old silver medallist at last year’s world outdoor event stepped into the circle for her sixth and final throw with victory already locked up thanks to her heave of 20.20 metres with her fourth attempt. 
Mitton bettered that with a natio­nal indoor record of 20.22 on her final throw in a celebratory finish. 
“To be the world champion, that sounds amazing,” said Mitton, who is also a Pan American and Comm­onwealth Games champion. “I was not able to say that before and now, I am probably never going to stop saying it. This is the moment that cannot be taken away from you.” 
Yemisi Ogunleye of Germany threw 20.19 for silver, while American Chase Jackson, the 2022 world outdoor champion, won bronze with 19.67. 
Maria Vicente of Spain, the under-23 champion in the heptathlon, ruptured her Achilles tendon in the pentathlon high jump, which could shelve her Paris Olympics dreams. 
“We have seen the doctors and I have a complete rupture,” Vicente said. “I will return [from injury] for sure, as I already did before.”

2,HBL PSL 2024: Double-header abandoned as rain spoils start  of Rawalpindi leg,Rain had prevented teams from holding any training session on Friday too.,"RAWALPINDI: Heavy rain marred the start of Rawalpindi leg of the HBL Pakistan Super League here on Saturday as both the matches were abandoned without a ball being bowled.
Defending champions Lahore Qalandars, led by Shaheen Shah Afridi, were scheduled to face Babar Azam-captained Peshawar Zalmi in the day game whi­ch was to be followed by a night clash between Shadab Khan’s Islamabad United and Rilee Rossouw-skip­pered Quetta Gladiators.
However, a heavy downpour which left the Pindi Cricket Stad­ium soggy made any action impossible resulting in both the games getting called off, and all the four teams were given a point each. Rain had prevented teams from holding any training session on Friday too.
Multan Sultans of Mohammad Rizwan lead the six-team league with 10 points (five wins and one loss). Just one point below them are the Gladiators (four wins, one loss and one no-result). Third-placed Zalmi have seven points from six games (three wins, two losses and one no-result) followed by the United who have earned five points in six matches (two wins, three losses, one no-result). Shan Masood-led Karachi Kings with four points in their bag from five outings are fifth (two wins, three losses) while winless Qalandars are placed at bottom with a solitary point which they got on Saturday.
Though there was a forecast of heavy rains on Saturday, still several fans had opted to witness the games. But unfortunately they could not see their favourite players in action.
Rain continued throughout the day with intervals.
Shahid Hussain, an enthusiastic fan who came all the way from Peshawar to support Zalmi and see Babar’s willow work, was left disappointed.
“I came here on Thursday to watch this match, but rain washed away my plan,” he said, and added that he would now extend his stay in Rawalpindi for two days to watch the Zalmi-United clash on Monday.
On Sunday, the Kings face the Sultans on Sunday at the National Bank Stad­ium in Karachi before the action returns to Rawa­lpindi on Monday when United take on Zalmi.

3,NZ three down in pursuit of 369 to beat Australia,"The home side were 111-3 at stumps on day three, with Rachin Ravindra unbeaten on an eye-catching 56 and Daryl Mitchell on 12.","WELLINGTON: Steve Smith pulled off two stunning catches to leave Australia with the advantage as New Zealand stumbled early in their pursuit of 369 to win the first Test here at the Basin Reserve on Saturday.
The home side were 111-3 at stumps on day three, with Rachin Ravindra unbeaten on an eye-catching 56 and Daryl Mitchell on 12, with the pair having put on 52 in 20.3 overs together.
Nathan Lyon took 2-27 — aided by some brilliance from Smith in the slips — to give the accomplished off-spinner six wickets for the match.
Lyon shapes as a key figure in preventing New Zealand from scoring the remaining 258 runs they need to win on a pitch that is taking turn and bounce.
New Zealand part-time spinner Glenn Phi­l­lips earlier capitalised on the conditions, snaring career-best figures of 5-45 as Australia were bundled out for 164 in their second innings.
Lyon was introduced in the sixth over of New Zealand’s response and made an immediate imp­act, having Tom Latham caught behind for eight.
The 36-year-old claimed the key wicket of Kane Williamson soon afterwards for nine, when Smith pouched a sharp catch down low at leg slip.
Smith’s second catch was even better, to rem­ove Will Young for 15 off part-time spinner Tra­vis Head, reacting qui­ckly to a fine edge that went low and to his left.
It was the 182nd Test catch from Smith, lifting him to sixth on the all-time list for outfielders — now 28 catches behind Indian leader Rahul Dravid.
Ravindra, who sco­red 240 in the first Test against South Africa last month, defied Australia late in the day with a series of aggressive strokes in his 94-ball knock.
The 24-year-old struck most of his eight fours through cuts or pulls and swatted Head over mid-wicket for six.
Mitchell was fortunate to survive an early stumping chance off Lyon, when the ball evaded the gloves of wicket-keeper Alex Carey, with the charging batsman well out of his ground.
Earlier, Australia lost their last six wickets in the space of 13 overs, with Phillips producing the best figures by any New Zealand spinner on home soil in 18 years, complementing his 71 with the bat in New Zealand’s first innings of 179.
Two wickets fell in the first session, nightwatchman Lyon departing for Australia’s top score of 41 and opener Usman Khawaja for 28 after they resumed at 13-2.
First-innings centurion Cameron Green scored 34 and Travis Head 29 but the end of their 46-run partnership for the fifth wicket sparked a collapse.
Head miscued Phillips to be caught at long-on, before the spinner removed Mitchell Marsh and Alex Carey to close catchers.
Green, who scored a career-high unbeaten 174 in the first innings, was also caught in close before Henry picked up the last two wickets to finish with 3-36.
New Zealand’s Will O’Rourke left the field after pulling up with a tight hamstring in his eighth over, putting the seamer in doubt for the second and final Test in Christchurch.

SAKHIR: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in action during the Bahrain F1 Grand Prix on Saturday.—Reuters

 
SAKHIR: Max Verst­appen started his bid for a fourth successive Formula One title with a commanding Bahrain Grand Prix win from pole position, plus fastest lap, to give Red Bull a timely boost after a trying week for the world champions and team principal Christian Horner. 
The triple world champion shut out all the off-track speculation surroun­ding the Horner inquiry to lead home Sergio Perez for an ominous Red Bull 1-2. 
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz completed the podium under the floodlights at Sak­hir with team mate Charles Leclerc finishing fourth. 
The win was Red Bull’s 114th since they arrived in Formula One 20 years ago, lifting the team level with former champions Willi­a­ms at fourth equal in the all-time lists. Verstappen now has 55 career wins.

5,"Liverpool strike late to beat Forest, Spurs fight back to close on top four","Victory pulls Klopp’s men clear of Manchester City, who face Manchester United today.","MANCHESTER: Darwin Nunez headed in a 99th-minute winner as injury-hit Liverpool moved four points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest, while Tottenham Hotspur came from behind late on to beat Crystal Palace on Saturday.
Liverpool’s resources have been stretched to the limit by a series of injuries in recent weeks as they attempt to win a quadruple in Jurgen Klopp’s final season.
The Reds were again without a host of star names including Moha­med Salah, Trent Alexander-Arn­old, Alisson Becker and Diogo Jota.
But there was some light at the end of the tunnel with Nunez and Dominik Szoboszlai making their return as second-half substitutes.
The Uruguayan made the telling impact with virtually the last touch of the game as Nunez rose highest to flick home Alexis Mac Allister’s cross.
Victory pulls Klopp’s men clear of Manchester City, who face Manchester United on Sunday, and five points clear of Arsenal before they travel to Sheffield United on Monday.
Defeat leaves Forest still just four points above the relegation zone and with the threat of a points deduction for breaches of financial rules still hanging over the club.
Tottenham have made a habit of late fightbacks at home under Ange Postecoglou and needed another one to inflict Oliver Glasner’s first defeat as Palace boss with a 3-1 win.
Eberechi Eze’s stunning free-kick gave the Eagles a shock lead on the hour mark.
Timo Werner’s first Spurs goal set up the grandstand finish when he tapped home Brennan Johnson’s low cross.
Cristian Romero then headed Tottenham in front before Son Heung-min sprinted clear to seal the three points.
Victory takes Spurs to provisionally within two points of fourth-placed Aston Villa.
Brentford came from behind to pile more pressure on under-fire Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino in a 2-2 draw.
Nicolas Jackson’s towering header powered the Blues into an early lead.
But Brentford are now five games unbeaten against their wealthier west London rivals.
Mads Roerslev levelled early in the second half before Yoane Wissa’s stunning overhead kick put the Bees in front.
A header from Axel Disasi saved Chelsea’s blushes to salvage a point but they remain in the bottom half of the table.
Newcastle United kept their quest for Europe alive with their first home win for nearly three months to climb up to eighth.
The Magpies beat Wolverhamp­ton Wanderers 3-0 to leapfrog their opponents in the table thanks to goals from Alexander Isak, Anthony Gordon and Tino Livramento.
Brighton & Hove Albion are falling further away from the fight for Europe next season after the Seagulls were soundly beaten 3-0 at Fulham.
Harry Wilson, Rodrigo Muniz and Adama Traore struck for the Cottagers to extend Brighton’s barren run to three wins in 12 league games.
Everton remain in a relegation dogfight despite having a 10-point deduction reduced to six this week.
Beto missed a first-half penalty before putting the Toffees in front against West Ham United.
But the Hammers came back to win 3-1 thanks to goals from Kurt Zouma, Tomas Soucek and Edson Alvarez.
David Moyes’ men move up to seventh and within just two points of the top six.

6,Bangladesh recall Jakir for Sri Lanka T20s,SYLHET: Bangladesh recal­led wicket-keeper/batsman Jaker Ali Anik to their squad for the upcoming three-match...,"SYLHET: Bangladesh recal­led wicket-keeper/batsman Jaker Ali Anik to their squad for the upcoming three-match Twe­n­ty20 International series against Sri Lanka, replacing injured uncapped spinner Aliss Al Islam.
Off-spinner Aliss sustained a finger injury while playing for Comilla Victorians in the rece­ntly finished Bangladesh Prem­ier League 20-over tournament.
“His recovery is estimated to take two to three weeks, thus ruling him out of the series,” team physiotherapist Bayjedul Islam Khan said in a statement.
Jaker, 26, performed well in his appearances for Comilla this year, making 199 runs in two matches with a strike rate of 141.
“We have three other frontline spinners,” said selection panel chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain.
“We believe that instead of adding another spinner to replace Aliss, the team’s balance would be better served by including someone like Jaker Ali, who can bolster the middle or lower-middle order and serve as a finisher.”
The three-match series begins on Monday in Sylhet.
Sri Lanka, who arrived in Bangladesh on Thursday, will also play three One-day Internationals and two Tests during the month-long tour.
Squad: Najmul Hossain Shanto (captain), Liton Das, Anamul Haque, Mohammad Naim, Towhid Hridoy, Soumya Sarkar, Mahedi Hasan, Mahmudullah Riyad, Taijul Islam, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Jaker Ali Anik.

7,Saudi Arabia formally launches bid to host 2034 World Cup,"Saudi Arabia will be the second country from Gulf region to host showpiece event, after neighbouring Qatar staged the 2022 finals.","RIYADH: Saudi Arabia launched its campaign to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup on Friday, a bid that is all but certain to succeed due to the absence of any other expressions of interest before global governing body’s deadline late last year. 
With Morocco, Portugal and Spain set to share the hosting of the 2030 tournament, FIFA limited the 2034 contest to bidders from the Asian and Oceania confederations. 
Saudi Arabia would be the second country from the Gulf region to host the showpiece event, after neighbouring Qatar staged the 2022 finals. 
The campaign is under the slogan “Growing. Together”, the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) revealed its bid logo, website, as well as a short bid film that celebrates “the passion, spirit and diversity of football in Saudi Arabia”. 
“This campaign is powered by the hopes and dreams of 32 million people in Saudi Arabia,” the head of the SAFF bid unit, Hammad Albalawi, said in a statement. “Our responsibility is to submit the best possible bid to FIFA, make our country proud and fulfil the trust placed upon us by more than 130 Member Associations across the world who supported our bid.” 
Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to position Saudi Arabia as a tourism, business and sports hub, the kingdom has invested heavily in sport. 
On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced a “multi-year strategic partnership” with the ATP, the governing body of men’s tennis. 
Since 2021, PIF has invested heavily in a number of major sports, including setting up the LIV golf tour, a rival to the PGA, and purchasing English Premier League club Newcastle United. 
It also owns four clubs in the Saudi Pro League and has lured global stars including Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar with huge salaries. 
The investment has led to accusations the kingdom is “sportswashing” international criticism of its human rights record. The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws. 
“Telling our football story to the world is of massive importance,” SAFF President Yasser Al Misehal said in a statement. “We’ve made unprecedented progress in both the men’s and women’s game, and our bid is an open invitation to the world to join us on this exciting journey.”  
Saudi Arabia was initially interested in bidding for the 2030 World Cup alongside Egypt and Greece but that idea was abandoned in June, leaving the path open for a tri-continental bid of Spain, Portugal and Morocco, with three matches in South America. 
Saudi Arabia announced its intention to bid for the 2034 event on October 4, as soon as the procedure had been launched. 
At one stage, Indonesia had considered a joint bid with Australia, or even other countries such as New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore, but on October 19 it agreed to support Saudi Arabia’s bid. 
Australia was also a contender but withdrew its interest on Monday following the Asian Football Confe­deration’s decision to back the Saudi bid. 
The next step in the process is the submission of the full bid documents to FIFA in July, with the appointment of hosts for both the 2030 and 2034 World Cups set to be rubber stamped at a FIFA Congress towards the end of the year. 
The next World Cup will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada in 2026.

8,Mbappe taken off at half-time as PSG held at Monaco,MONACO: Coach Luis Enrique said he took Kylian Mbappe off “for the good of the team” as the France captain was...,"MONACO: Coach Luis Enrique said he took Kylian Mbappe off “for the good of the team” as the France captain was substituted at half-time in Paris Saint-Germain’s 0-0 draw away to Monaco at Stade Louis II on Friday. 
Mbappe was not injured and emerged from the PSG dressing room at the start of the second half in a tracksuit, smiling and talking on the phone before taking a seat in the stand to watch the remainder of the game. 
Without him, PSG were perhaps fortunate to leave the principality with a draw which nevertheless allowed them to move to 55 points, 12 clear of second-placed Brest, who are in action on Sunday. 
They edge a step closer to retaining the French title, but the focus for Luis Enrique’s side is principally on Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 second leg away to Real Sociedad, into which they take a 2-0 lead from the first meeting last month. 
It remains to be seen what role Mbappe will play in that game, given that he has now either started on the bench or been replaced in each of his club’s three matches since he told the Qatar-owned club he would leave at the end of this season. 
“It was 100 percent the coach’s decision, because sooner or later we will have to get used to playing without Kylian Mbappe,” Luis Enrique said. “I took this decision for the good of the team. 
Mbappe informed PSG in mid-February that he intended to depart when his contract expires in June, after seven years at the Parc des Princes, with Real Madrid his likely next destination. 
Despite the visitors dominating possession, Monaco came closest to opening the scoring during the first half, with PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma keeping the hosts at bay. 
PSG looked more dangerous in the second half, but Bradley Barcola and Vitinha could not find a way past keeper Radoslaw Majecki. 
The result leaves Monaco, still winless at home this year, third with 42 points, although their Cote d’Azur rivals Nice can climb above them with a win at Toulouse on Sunday.

9,Okafor fires Milan to late win at livid Lazio,ROME: A late goal by forward Noah Okafor earned AC Milan a 1-0 win at Lazio in Serie A on Friday after a chaotic end...,"ROME: A late goal by forward Noah Okafor earned AC Milan a 1-0 win at Lazio in Serie A on Friday after a chaotic end to the game in which the outraged hosts were reduced to eight men in stoppage time. 
Milan, who ended their winless run of three games across all competitions, sit third in the league standings on 56 points. 
They are one point adrift of second-placed Juventus who travel to Napoli on Sunday and 13 behind leaders Inter Milan, who host Genoa on Monday. 
“In the last away matches we had conceded too many goals, being punished at the slightest chance,” coach Stefano Pioli told a press conference. “[But] the group works well, is compact and wants to do well from here to the end.” 
Milan conceded eight times in their previous three away games, all against teams in the lower half of the table. 
Following a first half short on action and chances, Milan continued to dominate possession and substitute Okafor scored in the 88th minute on a rebound from near the penalty spot, after his initial shot was denied by Lazio keeper Ivan Provedel. 
It was the most exciting moment of football in a niggly game in which Lazio had two players sent off in stoppage time, after Luca Pellegrini was dismissed for a second bookable offence just before the hour mark with a cascade of boos from dumbfounded home fans greeting the final whistle. 
Lazio drop down to ninth, level on 40 points with Napoli, after a defeat which was dreadful preparation for Tuesday’s return leg with Bayern Munich in the Champions League last 16. 
Maurizio Sarri’s side lead Bayern by a single goal after winning the first leg in the Italian capital 1-0 last month and his players will need to pick themselves as they are eight points from the top four. 
Lazio owner Claudio Lotito was so angered by referee Marco Di Bello’s performance that he said the club would take action against the decisions made against his team. 
“When the system isn’t reliable we should ask ourselves some questions,” said Lotito. “A referee should be able to understand where breaking point is... the league needs to have an independent control body which is outside of the current system.”

11,Rublev defaulted after angry tirade as Bublik reaches Dubai final,DUBAI: Andrey Rublev was defaulted from the Dubai Tennis Championships semi-finals for unsportsmanlike conduct on...,"DUBAI: Andrey Rublev was defaulted from the Dubai Tennis Championships semi-finals for unsportsmanlike conduct on Friday after yelling at a line judge in the final set of a tense encounter against Alexander Bublik.
In a chaotic match where both competitors fumed at the officials at various points, Rublev was defaulted by the chair umpire after a Russian-speaking official appeared to accuse him of using an obscenity, while he screamed at the line judge.
Rublev denied the allegation and said he had spoken in English during the confrontation.
A confused Bublik, who clawed his way back from a set down to lead 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-5, was awarded the win despite saying that he would be happy to continue the match.
The Russian-born Kazakh had fought back from 4-2 down in the decider, adding to the frustration of his childhood friend, who lashed out at the line official at the change of ends after disagreeing with a call.
Another official, who spoke Russian, then confronted Rublev and appeared to accuse him of swearing at the line judge in his mother tongue, which the world number five vehemently denied.
But after a lengthy back-and-forth, the 26-year-old was disqualified.
“I highly doubt Andrey said something crazy. He’s not this kind of guy. But I guess that’s the rules. That’s what they did, they just follow the procedure,” Bublik told reporters.
“There’s not much to say. With all due respect, it was a great match and both of us deserved to win. The crowd was there and we could have played one of the greatest matches against each other. It’s a pity it ended like this. I wish Andrey to get back on track as soon as possible.”
The result meant that Rublev will lose his prize money and ranking points earned at the tournament and that there would be no repeat of last year’s title clash where he was beaten by fellow Russian Daniil Medvedev.
Top seed Medvedev also endured a disappointing outing as the world number four crashed to a 7-5, 6-3 loss against fifth-seeded in-form Frenchman Ugo Humbert in the other semi-final.
The left-handed Humbert snapped Medvedev’s eight-match winning streak in Dubai to improve to 4-3 head-to-head against top-five opposition and 3-1 overall in clashes against the Russian.

15,Bayern held in Freiburg to boost Leverkusen title hopes,FREIBURG: Freiburg’s Lucas Hoeler scored an 87th-minute equaliser on Friday to snatch a 2-2 against visitors ...,"FREIBURG: Freiburg’s Lucas Hoeler scored an 87th-minute equaliser on Friday to snatch a 2-2 against visitors Bayern Munich, whose Bundesliga title hopes suffered a further blow. 
The result left champions Bayern, who have 54 points from 24 league matches, seven behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who have 61 and can pull further away with a win over Cologne on Sunday. 
Mathys Tel’s 35th-minute stunner had cancelled out an impressive opener from Freiburg captain Christian Guenter, before Jamal Musiala’s spectacular solo effort looked to have snared the three points for Bayern, preparing to host Italy’s Lazio in their Champions League last 16 second leg next week. 
Hoeler however had other ideas, chipping a volley through a crowded Bayern penalty area and past a helpless Manuel Neuer. 
“We played completely without structure [in the first half],” said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel. “We were not disciplined. 
“We were not in our positions, we lost possession going forward and allowed them to counterattack. 
“It was very clear that we wanted to play here with a different level of determination but we only started doing that after conceding a goal. But one good half is not good enough to win here. 
“It wasn’t a matter of will, we played recklessly for the first half hour.” 
Bayern have now failed to win away from home in four matches dating back to January in both the Bundesliga and Champions League. 
Tuchel’s side face Lazio, staring down an early exit with a 1-0 deficit from the first leg in Rome. 
The point sees Freiburg finish the night in ninth place in a crowded Bundesliga table, with only five points separating seventh and 15th places. 
“We played a good game” Freiburg’s Vincenzo Grifo told DAZN. “It’s clear that you have to suffer against Bayern.”
