1,Court summons Parvez Elahi for indictment,Hearing of illegal appointments case against former chief minister adjourned,"An anti-corruption court on Monday adjourned the hearing of the Punjab Assembly illegal appointments case against former chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and others till March 6.
The court summoned Parvez Elahi and other accused on the next date of hearing for indictment.
Anti-Corruption Court Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta heard the case, wherein the jail officials produced Muhammad Khan Bhatti. 
Several co-accused also appeared and marked their attendance during the proceedings.
The jail officials submitted a medical certificate and stated that Chaudhry Parvez Elahi could not be produced as he was sick.
At this, the court adjourned further proceedings till March 6 and summoned all accused for indictment on the next date of hearing.
The court also dismissed applications filed by the accused for provision of clear copies of the challan and related documents. 
It held that the copies had already been provided to the accused and if they needed more documents then those would also be provided, but the proceedings should not be delayed.
The Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) had registered the case, accusing Parvez Elahi of unlawful appointments and kickbacks. Allegedly, qualified candidates were denied appointment, while those who had not appeared in exams were appointed.
 The Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) claimed that, as the then chief minister, Elahi had misused his authority, influencing appointments allegedly after receiving bribe.
The court had twice delayed the indictment of the accused during the previous hearings.

2,Stray animals lurk around the city,"With the Kanji House out of order, countless stray dogs and donkeys pose a threat to the safety of citizens","Parents regularly taking their children out to play appreciate the benefits of physical activity and sports on the overall wellbeing of their little ones however, as dangerous stray animals start occupying every nook and corner of the city in the absence of animal shelters, locally known as Kanji Houses, concerned families will have no choice but to keep their children locked inside homes since letting them out could mean exposing them to the looming risk of a lethal dog bite.
Introduced during the British era, Kanji Houses were set up across various areas in Punjab for catching and sheltering stray animals roaming around the city however in recent times some shelter houses have been transformed into government offices or rest houses, while many others are under the control of land occupation mafias, resulting in a scenario where no place is available for keeping stray animals, who are freely lurking around in the cities, posing a threat to the safety of not only adults but also innocent children.
“There is an abundance of stray donkeys in my area, and many a times they have attacked our children. But unfortunately, the corporation staff has not been able to catch them,” shared Farid, a resident of Lahore.
Similarly, the residents of the Ghaziabad area of Lahore were also fed up with the presence of stray dogs. “Every third day somebody from my area is bitten by a stray dog,” revealed a local from the area, who also claimed that the corporation staff failed to address the problem and refused to take the troublesome animals to a shelter house.
“Kanji Houses were meant to catch stray animals in the city so that they could not harm anyone. It is a pity that today these places have been turned into government offices,” lamented Allah Rakha, the administrator of the local cattle market, who further informed that due to a lack of space in Kanji House’s, people like him had to travel outside the city for locating a lost animal.
According to details obtained by the Express Tribune, Kanji Houses were established on more than 150 government owned plots across nine divisions, and 38 districts of Punjab for keeping stray animals and lost pets and livestock such as cows, buffalos, goats, cats, dogs and donkeys.
These stray animals were caught and kept in the Kanji House by the corporation staff, and were later handed over to its owner after they paid a fine. But nowadays, major districts of the province including Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Sargodha and Sahiwal, have no functioning Kanji Houses, due to which the government has no place for keeping stray animals in these cities.
However, Tanvir Ahmed, the record keeper of a state-run Kanji House, claimed that a couple of stray animals had been caught after a long time, and the problem of stray animals in the city was resolving.
Nevertheless, Tanvir’s assertion appears dubious given the fact that the rate of catching stray animals has been consistently low over the past few years, but attacks on people by stray animals have been rising, with almost 1200 people injured across the province due to an attack by a stray animal. In this regard, former DG of the local government, Masood Mahmood Tamanna said, “The evacuation of stray animals from the urban population has already been done. Now, the few lost animals that are caught, are sent to the animal market, where they are named, numbered and tagged before being returned to the owner.”

5,"Rampant theft, arson threaten forest","Suspects set forest on fire, causing harm to local wildlife","The historically significant Lashariwala forest has fallen prey to the lawlessness of wood and reed thieves, who have resorted to setting ablaze hundreds of acres of land in a bid to cover up their illicit activities, including the illegal hunting of rare animals and birds.
A wildlife inspector has filed a case against the perpetrators, shedding light on the urgent need for conservation efforts.
Reports indicate that the revered Game Sangchari Lashariwala Forest, nestled near the Indus River Head at Taunsa Barrage, is facing rampant exploitation, with valuable wood and reeds being clandestinely harvested and sold.
The forest, spanning thousands of acres, has become a haven for poachers, resulting in the rapid depletion of ancient trees and reeds, and exacerbating air pollution due to a lack of reforestation efforts.
During a routine patrol in Mauza Faqirwali, Wildlife Inspector Ghulam Akbar and his team intercepted a group of individuals, including Muhammad Bilal Sindhi, Afzal Shaikh, and Saifullah Gadi, who were caught in the act of illicitly cutting wood and reeds worth millions of rupees.
Despite their attempts to evade capture by crossing the river, the perpetrators abandoned their loot, leaving behind evidence of their illegal activities across six to seven acres of land.
In a separate incident, Khadim Hussain Gadi, Abdul Malik Gadi, and Ghulam Abbas Gadi, accompanied by three unidentified accomplices, were found guilty of cutting wood and reeds spanning two to three Murabba in Mauza Lomarwala.
To conceal their misdeeds, they resorted to setting fire to the area, causing significant harm to the local wildlife. Saddar police station has taken cognizance of the matter and registered a case based on the complaint filed by Wildlife Inspector Ghulam Akbar.
The escalating incidents of theft and arson underscore the urgent need for robust conservation efforts to protect the ecological and cultural heritage of Lashariwala forest.
