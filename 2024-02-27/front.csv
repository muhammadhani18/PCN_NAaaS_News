0,Shattering glass ceiling: Maryam scripts history,Observers say the otherwise positive rise of the first woman CM still tinged with dynastic traditions," 
Maryam Nawaz scripted history on Monday as she was sworn in as Punjab's first woman chief minister, breaking through the glass ceiling in the political territory traditionally dominated by male politicians.
The 2024 general elections marked Maryam Nawaz's electoral debut. Previously appointed as the senior vice president of the party in January 2023 by PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, she was entrusted with the task of restructuring the party.
Maryam was elected as MNA from constituency NA-119 and MPA from PP-159 in constituency NA-123.Following the party's directive, she chose to retain the PP-159 seat, paving the way for her elevation to the position of chief minister of Punjab.
However, this was not the Sharif scion’s inaugural venture into Pakistan's political landscape. Actively engaged in the party's election campaign leading up to the 2013 elections, she also led the PML-N’s social media wing during and after the polls.
In 2014, she assumed the role of chairperson of the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, later contested in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and subsequently resigned. Despite holding no elected office, she was seen distributing laptops to students on behalf of the Punjab government.In 2016, during the former premier and her father Nawaz Sharif's open-heart surgery, Maryam took control of the media narrative, providing timely updates on her father's condition through her Twitter account.Maryam faced scrutiny for her control over the government’s messaging, especially when leaked audio clips revealed her instructing then-information minister Pervaiz Rasheed on advertisements for certain TV channels.
She admitted the authenticity of the clip, clarifying that she was referring to party ads.Maryam Nawaz’s electoral prowess was put to the test in September 2017 during the NA-120 by-elections, where she led the campaign for her ailing mother, Kulsoom Nawaz, securing victory with a considerably reduced margin.
This marked a pivotal moment for Maryam as she emerged as the heir to Nawaz Sharif’s political legacy.Debates among analysts revolved around whether the by-election victory truly signalled a triumph for the embattled PML-N.
This constituency had long been a stronghold for the party and the Sharif family, spanning nearly three decades.Political observers noted a positive shift in a party known for its conservative social ethos and a scarcity of women in prominent party and cabinet roles. However, they point out that her otherwise positive rise is still tinged with familial ties in a political landscape steeped in dynastic traditions.
Acknowledging the challenges she faced, Maryam conceded, ""The journey was more difficult than I had imagined."" During an interview with Voice of America, she highlighted the heightened criticism faced by women in the limelight, especially in leadership positions, compared to their male counterparts.""If a woman has formed ideals, principles, ideologies, convictions, values, and wants to carve a niche for herself, it will always be viewed with a little suspicion,"" she remarked.
Despite resistance from within the party’s ranks, Maryam expressed being ""pleasantly surprised"" by the acceptance she found among the people of Pakistan.Regardless of whether ""the people"" embraced her, it was evident that her ascent came with a substantial cost — both on a personal level for Maryam and for the party.
Many stalwarts within the party were unimpressed by the rapidity of her rise, especially in a male-dominated political landscape where women held scarce leadership roles.

1,"Imran, Bushra indicted in £190m corruption case",Both the accused deny charges against them,"An accountability court in Rawalpindi on Tuesday indicted former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, in the £190 million corruption case.

Judge Nasir Javed Rana presided over the hearing at the Adiala Jail. Judge Nasir has replaced Judge Muhammad Bashir as he is retiring in a few weeks.

Judge Bashir was supposed to indict the ex-premier and former first lady on Jan 26 but the indictment was deferred to Jan 30. It was then scheduled for Feb 10 but was again deferred till Feb 27.

During the hearing, Judge Rana read out the charge sheet against the two. Both Imran and Bushra denied the charges.

The court then summoned five National Accountability Bureau (NAB) witnesses at the next hearing on March 6.

The case of six others including Zulfikar Bukhari, Farhat Shehzadi, and Shehzad Akbar, was separated.
The lawyers of the accused had requested provision of the copy of the challan again.

At one point, the judge inquired that Imran, “please inform the court whether your teeth have been checked or not”.
The PTI founder said that no dental check-up had been conducted yet. “The prison administration had said that the doctor will come on Sunday, while now the prison administration is saying that the doctor will come next Sunday.”

The court granted both requests for provision of general physician and dentist for medical examination and dental check-up of the PTI founder.

In December, NAB had filed a corruption reference against Imran and seven others, including his wife, in connection with the Al-Qadir University Trust.

The case alleges that Imran and Bushra obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals for legalising Rs50 billion – at that time £190 million – that was identified and returned to the country by the UK during the previous PTI government.

The reference filed by NAB alleged that Imran, who is currently in jail, played a “pivotal role in the illicit transfer of funds”. It also claimed that despite being given multiple opportunities to justify and provide information, the accused deliberately, with mala fide intention, refused to give information on one pretext or another.

2,Fazl foresees collapse of ‘system’,JUI-F chief opposes arrest of politicians,"Warning of a “system collapse” in the country because of excessive interference from the establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman announced on Tuesday his party would stay away from the upcoming elections of the speakers and other higher posts.

Speaking at a news conference in Peshawar, Fazl departed from his oft-repeated stance against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, saying that he reiterated his longstanding opposition to the imprisonment of political figures.

The “system will collapse” because of the excessive interference from the establishment, Fazl told reporters, adding that the establishment wanted that the people elected to the assemblies were aligned to their preferences.

He recalled his party’s protests against rigging in the 2018 elections and expressed concerns over what he deemed as excessive interference in the country’s politics. Raising alarms, he said the interference had reached a point where even election candidates faced undue influence.

“They cannot run the country, and the system will collapse. Those who are sticking to the system will be crying in the coming days,” he said. He claimed that he had the information before the elections that his party would be suppressed in the February 8 vote for links to Afghanistan, and opposing Israel.

The JUI-F leader, who faced drubbing in the recent elections, also announced his decision to remain “neutral” in the upcoming presidential elections, adding that the party would also stay away from the elections of speakers, deputy speakers, and the leaders of the house.

Furthermore, he revealed the party would resign from the opposition benches in the assemblies. “We do not want to join any government and have decided to stay out of the flawed system,” the JUI-F chief said. “Those who are part of the system will cry.”

Highlighting that the arrests of political figures were not a new thing, he said that irrespective of political differences, he had consistently disapproved of the incarceration of politicians. “On a personal level, the arrests of political figures do not bring me joy,” he said.

Fazl recalled that he had had his share of incarceration too. “I have spent years in jail myself”. However, he maintained that he recognised legal proceedings and that the courts had to decide on the merit in each case.

Without explicitly mentioning PTI founder Imran Khan, who penned a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urging an election audit, Fazl stressed that political stakeholders must avoid engagement with foreign institutions on the internal affairs of the country.

Commenting on the relationship with PTI, Fazl remarked: “There was a ‘mountain’, and not a wall, between us and PTI.” However, he added that the JUI-F has consistently maintained an open-door policy for dialogue if any party demonstrated genuine intent to addressing its concerns.

Fazl highlighted that his party adhered to political traditions by treating the delegation of its rival, PTI, with respect. The JUI-F leader disclosed that the party’s Central General Council would convene to deliberate upon the future course of action in parliamentary politics.

3,ECP to hear SIC reserved seats case today,Five-member bench led by the CEC to conduct open hearing,"The country’s election oversight authority is scheduled to conduct an open hearing today, Tuesday, to settle the matter of allocating reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) in the national and provincial legislatures.
According to a cause-list issued on Monday, a five-member ECP bench led by Chief Election Commissioner Sikander Sultan Raja will hold the hearing at the commission’s Islamabad office at 10 am.
The ECP has issued notices to both the SIC chief and other respondents, including MQM’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Maulvi Iqbal Haider, and Mahmood Ahmed Khan, for the preliminary hearing.
The SIC, a relatively unknown political entity, emerged as a major party in the National Assembly and the provincial legislature of Punjab after independent candidates affiliated with the PTI joined it last week.
This development occurred as a result of an agreement between the SIC and the former ruling party, whose candidates had to contest the February 8 general elections as independents due to the ECP’s decision to deprive it of its election symbol in December last year.
According to the Constitution, independent candidates must join a political party three days after general elections.
The ECP has already allotted reserved seats to all other parties. It has allocated 19 women’s seats and four minority seats to the PML-N, 12 women’s seats and two minority seats to the PPPP, and four women’s seats and one minority seat to the MQM-P. Other parties—the JUI-F, the PML-Q, and the IPP—have each received one seat.
The ECP has so far notified the allocation of a total of 38 reserved seats for women and seven for minorities. It has held back its decision on the remaining 22 women’s seats and three minorities.
According to some experts, whether the ECP decides to allocate the reserved seats to the SIC or not, the matter will ultimately end up in the Supreme Court.
The matter of allocating seats to the SIC has also created another crisis as President Dr Arif Alvi declined on Monday to sign a summary moved by the caretaker government to summon the inaugural session of the National Assembly.

4,Alvi under fire in Senate for ‘attack on Constitution’,Rabbani says president has violated Article 91 by not summoning NA session,"Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani has labeled President Dr Arif Alvi’s refusal to sign a summary to convene the National Assembly’s inaugural session as “a terrorist attack” on the Constitution.
“Pakistan's Constitution is under threat of terrorism; this time, the President House has attempted an act of terrorism,” Rabbani, a member of the PPP, stated during a Senate session on Monday.
The caretaker Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs had forwarded a summary to the president, urging the commencement of the NA session on Monday. Despite the request, Dr Alvi exercised his constitutional authority to postpone the session by 15 days.
Dr Alvi declined to authorize its commencement, ostensibly due to the non-allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
The SIC, a relatively unknown political entity, emerged as a major party in the National Assembly and the provincial legislature of Punjab after independent candidates affiliated with the PTI joined it last week.
However, this refusal ignited a controversy, with the PML-N arguing that following the expiration of the February 29 deadline, the NA speaker could independently convene the session.
Reacting to the development during a point of order, Rabbani stated that the president's refusal to convene an NA session constitutes a flagrant violation of the Constitution.
“Rejecting the prime minister's summary for a National Assembly session is an unconstitutional act. The president is violating Article 91 of the Constitution. He should not derail the democratic system and refrain from violating the Constitution,” he added.
Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI noted that according to the Constitution, a National Assembly session should be convened within 21 days of the general elections, while the Election Act, 2017 mandates the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to publish Form 45 on its website within fourteen days of polls.
“The esteemed member of the house should also raise this issue,” he remarked.
Abro pointed out that the president is not summoning the NA session as the ECP has not yet allocated reserved seats to the SIC. “My question is why the ECP is dragging its feet on the allocation of reserved seats?”
Earlier, Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan of the JI observed that government institutions were consuming Rs458.1 billion of the taxpayer money with zero efficiency. The current model, he argued, is depriving the poor and enriching the rich.
“The losses of government-owned institutions have now reached up to ten percent of GDP, rendering state-run agencies unsustainable. If the government cannot run these institutions, then it should privatize them,” he suggested.
Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi stated that the decision regarding the privatization of government institutions will ultimately be made by the elected government.
He mentioned that more than 200 institutions are facing losses, including departments related to power, finance, and communication.
Referring to a report from the Ministry of Finance, he said these institutions incur a loss of Rs730 billion annually, whereas the overall profit of profitable institutions is around Rs570 billion. The net loss is approximately Rs160 billion.
“The loss-making entities include the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the National Highway Authority (NHA), the Pakistan Railways, and the Pakistan Steel Mills. The losses incurred by the NHA were close to Rs170 billion,” he added.

5,Murad’s election shows continuation of policies,Shah is the first lawmaker to be elected as the chief minister three times in a row," 
Syed Murad Ali Shah made history in Sindh when he became the chief minister for the third consecutive term on Monday, an indication that the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) would continue the same governance policy that had been pursued for the past 15 years.
Shah is the first lawmaker to be elected as the chief minister three times in a row. Previously, Syed Qaim Ali Shah had also served as the provincial chief minister three times, but for two consecutive terms.
Syed Murad Ali Shah is the son of former chief minister Syed Abdullah Shah, the first father-son duo in Sindh. The other similar examples were set by the Jam family of the Lasbela district of Balochistan and later by the Sharif family—Hamza and Shehbaz Sharif, and now Maryam and Nawaz Sharif.
Syed Murad Ali Shah started his political career in 2002, when he became a member of the provincial assembly (MPA) of Sindh from his home constituency in Sehwan. It was the same constituency that was represented by his late father, Abdullah Shah, from 1970 to 1993.
He played a pivotal role while sitting on the opposition benches during the Gen Musharraf tenure. He won the provincial assembly seat again in the 2008 and 2013 elections, becoming a minister in Syed Qaim Ali Shah’s cabinet. In 2016, he replaced Syed Qaim Ali Shah as the chief minister.
After the general elections in 2018, the PPP did not opt to shake up its Sindh set-up and continued with Shah in the top post in the province, which he held till the end of the government tenure in August 2023.
Born in Karachi in 1962, Shah received early education from St Patrick’s High School, Karachi, then went to the prestigious DJ Science College, Karachi, in 1979. He completed his bachelor's degree in Civil Engineeringg from the NED University, Karachi, in 1985.
Later, he did a Masters in Civil-Structural Engineering from Stanford University in California in 1987 and Engineering Economic Systems in 1993. Before joining politics, he worked both in the public and private sectors in Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, and the United States from 1986 to 2002.
In Pakistan, he worked as an engineer for the Hyderabad Development Authority, the Water and Power Development Authority, the Port Qasim Authority, and the Karachi Fish Harbour Authority. Later, he changed his career and started working as an investment banker, first at Citibank Karachi, then at Citibank London, Gulf Investment Corporation Kuwait, and Bizpivot USA.
Why a third time?
For many in the PPP and outside, Shah is considered a heavyweight politician, currently holding the position of vice president in the party as well as taking a seat in its Central Executive Committee (CEC). Besides, he is also seen as a close confidant of the PPP’s top leadership.
Several party leaders, when approached by The Express Tribune, gave credit to Shah for the overwhelming performance of the PPP in the February 8 general elections. In the last assembly, PPP had 91 seats in the 168-strong house. Now, it has a resounding majority of 112 seats in the house.
“For the first time in the history of the PPP, we have won the post of mayor of Karachi, along with the PPP’s victories on many provincial and national assembly seats. So Murad Ali Shah deserves credit for the PPP government’s performance,” PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro told The Express Tribune.
“Murad Ali Shah always took up Sindh’s case diligently with the federal government when it came to the distribution of financial and water resources. So, there was a party consensus on his name for the slot of chief minister,” he added.
In fact, a few names did make the rounds on social media for the post of chief minister, such as Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Sharjeel Inam Memon, and Faryal Talpur. However, the PPP leadership stayed firm behind Shah and got him elected for a record third term.
Shah’s critics attribute his phenomenal rise in politics to his ‘utmost obedience’ to the party leadership. “No doubt Murad Ali Shah is competent, but I think he is more obedient to leadership than others,” opined analyst and writer Prof Nawaz Khoso.
He does disagree [on certain matters] but blindly follows whatever orders are issued by the party leadership. The example of the Sindh government’s land being sold out to builders at throwaway prices and appointments of blue-eyed boys in the civil and police bureaucracy to appease party leaders can be quoted here,” Khoso added, while talking about his election.
“During the PPP term, Sindh witnessed massive bungling in government departments. Bad governance, poor infrastructure, ghost schools, a lack of medicines at government hospitals, as well as a deteriorating law and order situation, point to a bad performance. I don’t know why people laud his performance.”
It is also an interesting fact that since the PPP’s return to power in Sindh in 1988, seven of its total of eight chief ministers belonged to the ‘Syed’ families: three times Syed Qaim Ali Shah, one time Syed Abdullah Shah, and three times Murad Ali Shah.
The only exception is Aftab Shaban Mirani, who replaced Syed Qaim Ali Shah months before the sacking of then prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s first government in 1990. Syed Abdullah Shah was provincial chief executive from 1993 to 1996.
After a gap of 11 years, when the PPP came to power in 2008, it again nominated Syed Qaim Ali Shah for this coveted slot, who retained his position in 2013. He was relieved of the position in 2016. Since then, the position has been held by Murad Ali Shah.
