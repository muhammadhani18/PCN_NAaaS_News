0,"Brawl between ASF, CAA personnel prompts probe",Reports of the altercation reached the respective director generals of ASF and CAA,"An inquiry committee has been established to investigate a confrontation between Airport Security Force (ASF) personnel and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) staff at the New Islamabad International Airport.
The clash erupted over the alleged lighting of a fire.
The dispute escalated when the CAA team attempted to capture images of the smoke in the duty cabin of ASF.
Reports of the altercation reached the respective director generals of ASF and CAA, prompting the formation of a four-member joint inquiry team.
The team, led by the deputy airport manager of civil aviation and the additional director of ASF, is tasked with unravelling the details surrounding the incident.
Sources reveal that CAA vigilance and fire brigade personnel were on duty at the airport on the night between Thursday and Friday. The ASF's mobile post, situated on the cargo side of the airport, became a focal point of contention. ASF Quick Response Force personnel were stationed there when CAA officers arrived, alleging a complaint about unauthorised fires in the restricted area.
The ASF personnel denied the complaint, but the CAA staff observed traces of black smoke in the cabin. A disagreement ensued when CAA staff attempted to enter the cabin to document the evidence.
ASF commandos prohibited their entry, citing the presence of government weapons inside. 
Tensions escalated, leading to a physical altercation between the two agencies' personnel.
Upon receiving information, additional ASF and CAA officials reached the scene to bring the situation under control. Following a complaint by CAA, ASF initially suggested an inquiry at the headquarters level. Subsequently, a joint inquiry team was formed to investigate the incident.
The inquiry team has initiated the process by recording statements from officials of both institutions. The Express Tribune contacted the New Airport police station which confirmed the altercation.

1,‘Unruly’ passenger disrupts Dubai-Islamabad flight,"Video footage of the altercation emerged, revealing the extent of the disturbance","A man was arrested by the Airport Security Force (ASF) at the Islamabad airport for creating panic on an Islamabad-bound flight from Dubai on Monday.
The disruptive incident unfolded on a private airline flight as an allegedly intoxicated passenger, identified as Hassan, scuffled with the plane crew.
The airline’s security personnel took action during the flight, restraining Hassan, handcuffing him, securing him to a wheelchair, and tying his feet. Upon landing, he was promptly handed over to the Airport Security Force (ASF).
According to aviation authorities, flight number 614, en route from Dubai to Islamabad, witnessed the passenger’s unruly behaviour despite warnings from the flight crew. The passenger not only defied the crew's instructions but also physically assaulted the airline security staff attempting to control him.
Video footage of the altercation emerged, revealing the extent of the disturbance.
The security team can be seen overpowering the passenger, ensuring his compliance by handcuffing him and placing him in a wheelchair with his feet tied. The pilot reported the incident to air traffic control, prompting ASF personnel on the ground to be on high alert.
Following the landing at the New Islamabad International Airport, ASF took custody of Hassan and summoned him to the ASF control room.
The man sought a written apology from the airline management. The airline, following Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), chose not to pursue further action after forgiving the passenger.

2,Police performance hits rock bottom,"Rawalpindi’s senior sleuths seek overhaul of investigation wing, depoliticisation","The investigation and detection of cases lodged by the Rawalpindi district police in January this year is touching at its lowest ebb as the investigation wing failed to submit challans in a good number of heinous cases to the courts on time.
According to the law, the police are bound to submit the challan within 14 days, but investigation officers usually take six months to one year to submit a complete challan, thus ‘facilitating’ the accused involved in cases of serious nature.
The performance of investigation teams of 33 police stations across the district has turned out to be very disappointing and poor. Despite repeated announcements and tall claims of police top brass that the police performance improved last month, the investigation police have miserably failed to present the challans of cases in the courts on time.
The IOs even couldn’t arrest a record number of accused in heinous cases. The district police registered a total of 4,531 cases in Jan and presented 1,903 final challans in the courts. 70 per cent of challans submitted in the courts were related to the cases of kite flying, profiteering, gambling, liquor consumption, and petty brawls.
However, the investigation police failed to submit challans in heinous cases of murder, robbery, kidnapping, kidnapping of women, and drug trafficking in the courts. Police nominated 6,718 people in a total of 4,531 cases and arrested only 2,606 accused. Interestingly, the female SSP Investigation terms this performance excellent.
Out of these listed cases, the police failed to trace two cases, and quashed 28 cases as fake, while 54 arrested accused were acquitted and released. The Sadiqabad police registered 475 cases in a month, the Taxila police 427, the New Town police 331, and the Bani police lodged 281 FIRs. The women's police station has yet to register a single case in January.
The situation is so alarming that the accused involved in heinous cases have started fleeing after being granted bail.
Senior investigation officers are of the view that the police teams are continuously failing to arrest the accused and the prevailing investigation system will continue at the cost of police performance until the police are depoliticised and the investigation system is separated from the police.
They further say after increasing of strength, the investigation wing should be spared of arresting political workers, monitoring politicians and going after them. The authorities need to come up with a clear investigation system soon and otherwise, the police investigation will collapse.
Rawalpindi District Bar Association president Intizar Mehdi Shah says the 14-day period for presenting a challan to the court is too short and suggests the law be amended to 30 days. He also called for abolishing the challan system with several witnesses and de novo hearings immediately to avoid delays in judgments of cases.
Retired District and Sessions Judge Shaukat Ali Sajid argues that less number of accused in a case always benefits the complainant, but up to six nominations in a case spoils the case.
Senior criminal lawyer Sabtain Bukhari also suggests increasing the period of submission of challan from 14 days to a month and strict departmental action against the investigator for failing to meet the 30-day deadline. The case should be also taken from the IO as punishment, he suggested.
Advocate Sabtain also suggested introducing the forensic lab system at the divisional level for speedy investigation of cases.
