0,EFP introduces code of conduct for domestic workers’ rights,"Supported by ILO, initiative highlights need for fair treatment, decent working conditions","The Employers Federation of Pakistan (EFP) launched a code of conduct for employers of domestic workers during a tripartite meeting, represented by more than 100 representatives from employers, workers’ federations, civil societies, and officers from the labour department, as well as the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

The code of conduct consists of various crucial aspects including implementation of minimum wage for workers, ensuring working hours, fulfilling health and safety rules among other initiatives.

While addressing the launch ceremony held at a private hotel, Secretary Labour and Human Resource Development Department Sindh, Shariq Ahmed stated that the code of conduct will help promote decent working conditions and protect the rights of domestic workers. He highlighted that the initiative will help domestic workers, who represent a large portion of the informal economy, and are deprived of their fundamental rights. He noted that these domestic workers face numerous challenges, including low wages, poor working conditions, harassment, and various forms of abuse. He appreciated the efforts and commitments of EFP in promoting decent work for all and stated that the code will provide the basis for legislation on domestic workers in Sindh, according to a press release.

EFP’s Secretary-General, Syed Nazar Ali shed light on the salient features of the code of conduct, which has been developed with the support of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and in consultation with all stakeholders, to foster decent working conditions for domestic workers. The code serves as a voluntary tool and offers guidance to employers of domestic workers on the terms of employment to uphold equitable practices and nurture positive working relationships.

Country Director of ILO Pakistan Office, Geir Tonstol emphasised that implementing the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and other ILO Conventions like Convention 189 will pave the way to promoting decent work for domestic workers. He acknowledged the national laws for domestic workers, underscoring the link between the laws and their implementation. Tonstol expressed hope that this code of conduct would serve as a guideline to initiate discussions and lead to the formulation of a law for domestic workers in Sindh. He reiterated the ILO’s technical support to its tripartite constituents in promoting decent work for all in Pakistan, including domestic workers.

EFP Vice President, Feroz Alam highlighted the organisation’s efforts and reiterated the vital role of domestic workers in our lives, caring for our children and managing household responsibilities. He stressed the importance of respecting domestic workers and ensuring they have favourable working conditions, particularly considering their significance as a source of employment, especially for those with limited education, notably women. He advocated for the regulation of their employment and working conditions, asserting that implementing a code of conduct would foster behavioural changes and acknowledgment of domestic workers.

Secretary-General of the Pakistan Workers Federation, Waqar Memon echoed similar sentiments, regarding the initiative as a positive step toward recognising and safeguarding the rights of domestic workers. He underscored the necessity of enacting laws to protect the rights of domestic workers in Sindh, emphasising the importance of legal frameworks to ensure their fair treatment and well-being.

1,WTO meeting seeks modest outcomes,Aims to set new global commerce rules with world trade at ‘critical juncture’,"Trade ministers from around the world gathered in Abu Dhabi on Monday for a World Trade Organisation meeting that aims to set new global commerce rules, but its Chief, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and delegates sought to curb expectations.
The almost 30-year-old global watchdog, whose rules underpin 75% of global commerce, tries to strike deals by consensus, but such efforts are becoming more difficult amid signs that the global economy is fragmenting into separate blocs.
“Let’s not pretend that any of this will be easy,” Okonjo-Iweala said in her opening speech, describing the atmosphere as “tougher” than the WTO’s last 2022 meeting, citing wars, tensions and elections as signs that trade growth will undershoot the organisation’s own estimate.
She called on ministers to “roll up their sleeves” and complete negotiations, but seemed to rule out any deal in Abu Dhabi on reforming the body’s mothballed appeals court.
“We are not there yet,” she said.
Thani Al Zeyoudi, conference chair and UAE’s Foreign Trade Minister said in an opening address “The multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core is at a critical juncture; it is confronting many challenges.” “I now ask all of you to show the world that the WTO is alive and well and fully capable to deliver results that matter to people everywhere,” he said. Some delegates privately voiced concerns that India’s trade minister, seen as the main holdout on some key issues including agriculture, was absent on Monday although New Delhi said he would be in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.
New members
Negotiators say they remain hopeful for an agreement that could buoy global fish stocks and protect fishermen by banning government subsidies.

Other outcomes from the four-day meeting that are either definite or achievable are the accession of two new members - Comoros and East Timor - and a deal among around 120 countries to remove development-hampering investment barriers.
Tougher areas are extending a 25-year moratorium on applying tariffs on digital trade, which South Africa and India oppose, and an agreement on agriculture trade rules that has eluded negotiators for decades.
Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal repeated on Monday New Delhi’s drive for a controversial stand-alone permanent waiver to WTO rules that currently restrict domestic agriculture subsidies on food items like rice.
“I think this week is really about trying to consolidate progress from two years ago and build on where possible, but I don’t think there’s going to be major new breakthroughs in new areas,” said Simon Conveney, Ireland’s Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, referring to the WTO’s 2022 meeting in Geneva.
US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the meeting was a chance to “chart a future path together” and that success should not be measured by the number of deals.
One factor that could help is the determination of Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister, whose insistence on all-night meetings helped deliver a package of deals in Geneva in 2022. She has already asked ministers to plan for the four-day talks to run overtime.
The European Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said that uncertainty and multiple crises were impacting the rules-based global order. “This tense geopolitical environment makes multilateral organisations like the WTO much more, not less, important,” he said. REUTERS

2,"China to import 5,000 tons of sesame in FY24",Will ramp up investment in sesame contract farming project,"China will increase investment in the Pak-China sesame contract farming project and has plans to import at least 5,000 tons of sesame from Pakistan this year, Project Manager Xi Jianlong said.
“In 2023, we imported 400 tons of sesame from Pakistan, and this year, we plan to import at least 5,000 tons,” he said in an interview. At the end of 2023, the first batch of sesame from the project was shipped to China, signalling a promising year for sesame exports.
Sesame, a traditional crop in Pakistan, has faced challenges such as low market demand and limited cultivation. Recognising China’s increasing demand for sesame, the Sino-Pak Agricultural Cooperation and Exchange Centre, led by China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), collaborated with Pakistani farmers to take contract farming initiatives.

Read Sesame exports to China surge 126.3%
China’s sesame import volume has remained stable at approximately 1 million tons over the past three years. Pakistan’s sesame holds the advantage of being among the first to enter the market in the northern hemisphere every year, and its proximity to China ensures a short shipping time of only 10 to 15 days by sea, said Xi.
“When I surveyed Pakistan in 2018, the sesame cultivation area was only 200,000 acres. By 2023, it had increased to 1 million acres,” highlighted Xi.
“We also provide support in terms of cultivation resources and technical training for local farmers, and their yield per acre has almost doubled compared to 2018.”

3,Bulgarian envoy urges deeper collaboration,"Calls on business community to fully utilise potential, improve bilateral trade","Ambassador Irena Gancheva of Bulgaria has highlighted the untapped potential for collaboration between Pakistan and Bulgaria across various sectors. Addressing the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), she highlighted Bulgaria’s offerings in food processing, agriculture, Information Technology (IT), and new technologies.
President Kashif Anwar and Senior Vice President Zafar Mahmood Chaudhry of LCCI welcomed Gancheva, underscoring the importance of strengthening bilateral trade relations. Executive Committee Members including Raja Hassan Akhter, Mian Attiqur Rehman, Ahmed Elahi, and Mohammad Tauqeer Malik also participated in the discussion.
Gancheva noted the need to enhance trade figures between Pakistan and Bulgaria, pointing out Bulgaria’s export of wheat and import of textile items from Pakistan, reflecting broader trends within the European Union. She highlighted Bulgaria’s EU membership since 2007, emphasising its favourable taxation system and access to a market of 1.3 billion customers.
Bulgaria boasts strengths in Information Technology, automotive, mechanical engineering, electronics, mechatronics, and robotics, offering low operational costs and robust manufacturing capabilities. The ambassador reiterated Bulgaria’s participation in the GSP Plus arrangements and shared information about upcoming international exhibitions in Bulgaria. She stressed the need to explore more opportunities to diversify trade and partnerships.
The LCCI president acknowledged Bulgaria’s support for Pakistan’s GSP Plus status, facilitating increased exports to the EU. He highlighted Bulgaria’s strategic location as a gateway for Pakistani products to enter the EU market, stressing the importance of strengthening trade ties.
Anwar stressed the need to capitalise on the immense opportunities for trade expansion, aiming for bilateral trade to reach at least $1 billion in the near future. He said that the volume of Bulgaria’s total global trade is around $108 billion with Pakistan only having a share of a mere $80 million. He underscored the need to bridge the gap between the actual potential and current trade figures. He said that there is a considerable scope for Bulgaria to enhance its imports of citrus fruits, mangoes, value-added textiles, sports goods, leather products, furniture, marble among other goods from Pakistan. Identifying key areas for collaboration, he said Pakistan and Bulgaria could enhance economic cooperation through joint ventures in sectors like IT, food processing, automotive, tourism, and agriculture technology.
The LCCI president also briefed the Bulgarian envoy about Pakistan’s Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and efforts to expedite investment in five key areas including, defence, agriculture, minerals, ITT and energy. He also explained that the government is making an effort to improve the business climate in Punjab through streamlined facilitation for investors.
Anwar highlighted the importance of connecting the private sectors of both countries through exchanges of delegations, participation in trade fairs, and collaborative ventures, fostering a mutually beneficial partnership between Pakistan and Bulgaria.

4,"Rupee, yuan to join UAE payment system Buna","It aims to improve cross-border currency transactions, deepen international cooperation","United Arab Emirates-based cross-border payment system Buna, is set to expand to include currencies from Pakistan, China, India, and several African and European countries by 2024-25.
The system is already connected to 108 live banks across 14 countries, with an additional 105-plus banks set to on board the platform. Currently, six currencies including four from the Arab region, namely UAE dirham, Saudi riyal, Egyptian pound, and Jordanian dinar, as well as the US dollar and European single currency euro, are part of the platform, processing real-time funds transfer cost-effectively.
“The inclusion of rupee in the payment system will improve the efficiency of cross-border currency transactions in Pakistani banks and help deepen Pakistan’s international economic, trade and investment cooperation,” Ren Haiping, Deputy Head of Department of Strategic Research, China Centre for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), told China Economic Net.

Read Foreign currency inflow hopes aid rupee’s uptrend
“The vital significance of financial infrastructure in curbing systemic financial risks and improving financial market stability is self-evident, thus Buna could help improve Pakistan’s financial market infrastructure and promote local development of cross-border currency business,” noted Haiping. “In addition, this will help attract more foreign companies to make full use of Buna to deepen cooperation with Pakistan to promote the improvement of Pakistan’s economic situation,” he said.
Last year, Pakistan used RMB to pay for crude oil from Russia for the first time, which could be described as a profound impact on Pakistan’s economic development and the global economic pattern. RMB settlement has not only simplified the transaction process, but also reduced transaction costs.
“Currently, the dominance of the US dollar in international trade and finance is being questioned increasingly, and many countries have begun to seek diversified currency settlement and reserve methods to reduce dependence on a single currency. Against this background, Pakistan’s decision has a significant demonstration effect,” said the CCIEE deputy head.
“Joining Buna this time means another successful exploration of Pakistan in the financial field and indispensable step towards de-dollarisation,” he said.

5,Stocks surge on political clarity,"Benchmark KSE-100 index climbs 490.11 points, settles at 63,305.93","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday experienced a significant bullish activity as investors were encouraged by the easing of political turmoil following the election of chief ministers of Sindh and Punjab provinces.
In the morning, the trading session commenced with a spike in investor interest when the KSE-100 index surged rapidly in the wake of formation of provincial governments following general elections on February 8.
Resultantly, the index breached the 63,000-point barrier, touching its intra-day high at 63,732.50. However, concerns about the political scenario in the centre owing to delay in convening the National Assembly session by the president, triggered selling pressure towards the close of trading.
Despite the pressure, the KSE-100 index managed to move upwards again, propelled by reports that the government may try to secure up to $8 billion in International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan under the Extended Fund Facility and climate financing.
“Bullish activity was witnessed at the bourse as investors weighed the easing of political noise after the election of CMs for Sindh and Punjab,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Mid-session pressure emerged on concerns over the outcome of National Assembly session, which has been delayed,” he said, adding that government’s efforts to win up to $8 billion in IMF loan quota under the Extended Fund Facility and climate financing played the role of catalyst in bullish close in a post-election rally at the PSX.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded impressive gains of 490.11 points, or 0.78%, and settled at 63,305.93. Topline Securities observed in its report that the KSE-100 index commenced trading on a buoyant note. “This bullish momentum in the market finds its roots in the initiation of the provincial government formation process,” it said.
Notably, the Punjab Assembly elected Maryam Nawaz as the Chief Minister while the Sindh Assembly picked Murad Ali Shah as the Chief Minister. “The smooth progress towards formation of governments at provincial levels has bolstered investor confidence.”
Investor participation rose further with average traded volumes and value reaching 452.9 million shares and Rs16.5 billion respectively, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) remarked in its report that the “price drew into the general election gap on the first trading day of the week.”

Some 71 shares rose while 25 fell in the KSE-100 index with Pakistan Oilfields (+2.53%), Meezan Bank (+1.36%) and Systems Limited (+1.36%) being the biggest contributors to the gains, it said, adding that tech names remained well bid with NetSol Technologies (+7.5%), Air Link Communication (+5.6%) and TRG Pakistan (+2.45%) all gaining significant ground.
Engro (+0.62%) announced CY23 earnings per share of Rs39.17, down 14% year-on-year and dividend per share of Rs48. For the Oct-Dec quarter, Engro booked loss per share of Rs3.22 due to the loss on thermal assets re-measurement.
“It is pertinent to note that this loss on re-measurement will not result in cash outflow and when the sale of thermal assets concludes, the difference between the agreed sale price and the cost of investment (gain on divestment) will be reflected in the standalone accounts,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that political clarity and better financial results fueled the market momentum. “Going forward, a cautious approach is recommended and investors are advised to sell on strength,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 452.9 million shares against Friday’s tally of 377.97 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs16.5 billion.
Shares of 345 companies were traded. Of these, 207 stocks closed higher, 114 dropped and 24 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 54.1 million shares, gaining Rs0.05 to close at Rs4.44. It was followed by Kohinoor Spinning with 53.4 million shares, losing Rs0.02 to close at Rs4.57 and WorldCall Telecom with 22.97 million shares, gaining Rs0.01 to close at Rs1.31.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs492.3 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,Chinese solar firm eyes growth in Pakistan,Trina Solar head says surge in power prices propelled demand for solar energy,"Pakistan’s demand for solar energy is rising as both residences and businesses increasingly recognise solar power as a reliable and cost-efficient source of electricity.
According to official figures, Pakistan imported $1.11 billion worth of solar products from January to September 2023, equivalent to an estimated 4GW of modules. This coincides with the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) releasing framework guidelines in September 2023 to expedite power purchase agreements for solar projects and integrate solar onto public building roofs.
In light of these developments, Trina Solar, a global leader in smart PV technology and energy storage solutions, anticipates substantial growth in the Pakistani market. This optimistic outlook is fuelled by reforms in solar initiatives, fluctuating fuel prices, and rapid advancements in solar technology. The company’s foresight is supported not only by market dynamics but also by a strategic focus on reducing solar project Levelised Cost of Energy.
The introduction of high-power modules, driven by technological breakthroughs aligns with the Pakistani market’s preference for high-power output modules.
Trina Solar has undertaken projects across Pakistan in various market segments, including residential, commercial, and industrial, and utility scale.

Talking with a group of journalists on Monday, Trina Solar Asia Pacific Head, Dave Wang emphasises the company’s commitment to empowering diverse entities across Pakistan, fostering both economic prosperity and environmental stewardship. “Our mission ‘Solar Energy for All’ propels our commitment to delivering industry-leading modules, enabling our customers to achieve ‘grid parity’, making it more economical to generate electricity from solar modules than solely from conventional grids.”
Wang underscores the significant impact on households and businesses, saying that reducing the cost of electricity makes a substantial difference, especially given the recent surge in electricity prices over the last 18 months, driven by high fuel prices and general inflation. “Additionally, residences and businesses in areas experiencing prolonged power blackouts can now tap into an alternative source of electricity rather than relying solely on the grid,” he said.
To illustrate the financial benefits, Wang provides an example of a residential household with a monthly electricity consumption of 500 units, resulting in a monthly bill of approximately Rs20,000. “If the homeowner invests in a 5kW system generating 6200 units at a cost of Rs900,000, the potential savings will be of Rs341,000 annually, in this scenario, the modules would essentially cover their own costs within 2-3 years”.

7,Rupee at 4-month high as inflows rise,Currency propped up by reports saying govt may seek larger IMF package,"Pakistani currency on Monday hit a four-month high at Rs279.20 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market as it resumed the uptrend on the back of increase in supply of foreign currency compared to its demand for imports.
Market talk suggests that dollar inflows surged on account of rise in remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis and higher export earnings. Exporters scrambled to sell the greenback on forward counters in the currency market, believing that the rupee may continue to strengthen in the coming days.
Besides, the rupee appreciated in the backdrop of reports saying that the government would try to secure a larger International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme of $7.5-8 billion when the current $3 billion standby arrangement ended in March-April 2024.
Earlier, the government said it would approach the global lender for seeking a loan package of $6 billion. Higher inflows of foreign currency in future will further support the rupee.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee gained 0.06%, or Rs0.16, on a day-on-day basis and closed at Rs279.20/$.
The currency has regained 10% of its value, or Rs27.90, in the past five and a half months since closing at the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
Pakistani rupee, however, maintained its downtrend in the open market owing to the uptick in demand for the greenback. Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported that the local currency decreased Rs0.05 at Rs282.28/$ in the retail market.

Read Rupee falls after dip in reserves
Consequently, the disparity between rupee values in the two markets further widened to Rs3.08 (or 1.10%), getting closer to the ceiling of 1.25% (around Rs4 at current levels) recommended by the IMF. The widening gap may become a cause for concern. Earlier, it surged to Rs30-40, resulting in high volatility in currency markets.
Treasury firm Tresmark said on Saturday that the rupee had remained in the range of 279-280 to a dollar in the past 30 days.
“It is no surprise that senior officials have already started approaching the IMF for a new, larger package that will provide economic stability,” it said.
It is evident that dollar liquidity in the market is ample with banks’ Nostros sufficiently funded.
“Within the next two weeks, we will see an increase in remittances (ahead of Ramazan and Eidul Fitr). This will further improve dollar liquidity levels. However, demand for dollars for Umrah too will go up (in open market).”
Due to such factors, the Pakistani rupee vs the US dollar appears to be range bound till the end of March and perhaps even beyond, it added.

9,Bank financing hits record high,Reaches 93% of total deposits as banks continue to lend freely to govt,"Pakistan’s commercial banks have continued to freely lend to the cash-strapped government at elevated rates of return, taking their financing to a record high of 93% of total deposits in January 2024.
According to data compiled and shared by Optimus Capital Management (OCM), banks’ credit to the private sector, however, remained stagnant at the eight-month low at 44% of deposits in January. Higher inflation and interest rates did not allow businesses to expand their production lines and also set up new factories.
Bank deposits ticked down to Rs27.54 trillion in January compared to Rs27.84 trillion in December 2023, as “rich depositors apparently withdrew cash that they had deposited in December on the request of banks to allow financial institutions to maintain their books with good numbers,” Arif Habib Limited (AHL) economist Sana Tawfik said while talking to The Express Tribune.
She said the government’s reliance on domestic debt was on the rise due to lesser foreign loan inflows for quite a long time.
Data suggests that banks invested Rs25.60 trillion in government debt securities like T-bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) and Sukuk out of the total deposits of Rs27.54 trillion. This led to a rise in the investment-to-deposit ratio (IDR) to the all-time high of 93% in January.
The IDR stood at 85% a year ago in January 2023 and at 91% in December 2023.
Government borrowing from domestic banks is on the rise to finance the fiscal deficit widening primarily due to a significantly high interest cost on debt. The record high policy rate of 22% is estimated to push interest payments beyond Rs8 trillion in this fiscal year.
A one-percentage-point rise in interest rate increases interest cost by around Rs200-250 billion a year. The central bank cumulatively jacked up its key policy rate by 15% between September 2021 and June 2023.
Financial markets hope that the central bank will start slashing the policy rate in March or April this year, which will result in a reduction in interest payments and will encourage private businesses to borrow from banks for their existing and new investment projects.
The government has continued to increase borrowing from commercial banks since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) barred it from taking loans from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in mid-2019. It is believed that central bank lending triggers inflation in the economy.
Credit to private sector
Credit flow to the private sector remained stagnant at Rs12.09 trillion in January 2024 out of the total deposits of Rs27.54 trillion, as a result of which the advances-to-deposit ratio (ADR) stood at 44% for the second consecutive month.
The ADR had been on the wane in the prior eight months and reached 44% in December 2023 compared to 52% in April 2023.

Read FIA unearths bank fraud including counterfeiting
AHL’s Tawfik said the ADR dropped also due to the change in banks’ strategy to accept maximum deposits in the past one year compared to their reluctance to receive more deposits in December 2022.
She recalled that the government had imposed a tax on those banks whose ADR was lower than 50% in 2022. Therefore, the banks increased the ratio through lowering their deposit levels. Later, the government suspended the tax.
Market talk suggested that the tax may be imposed again this year on lower ADR to encourage financial institutions to lend maximum funds to the private sector to ramp up economic activities, she said.
Bank deposits
Customer deposits at banks ticked down in January compared to December 2023. They, however, grew 21% in the past one year to Rs27.54 trillion in January 2024 compared to Rs22.75 trillion in the same month of last year.
Tawfik said bank deposits grew for two major reasons – conversion of workers’ remittances into Pakistani rupees and soaring government debt taken from local banks. Both the transactions are shown in deposits. The local relatives of overseas Pakistanis who send funds back home deposit them in banks.
She pointed out that the government borrowed from banks for deficit financing but the money continued to remain parked in banks, which inflated the deposit size.
Negative return
The excessive lending to the government is sometimes made through bank borrowing from the central bank.
Sometimes banks make expensive borrowing from the central bank at over 22% and lend to the government at a rate less than 22%, taking a hit on their returns, which become slightly negative.
However, banks made most of the lending through deposits and partially meet the government financing requirement through borrowing from the central bank.
Tawfik said banks were doing so on expectation that the central bank would soon cut interest rate, which would turn margins positive.
