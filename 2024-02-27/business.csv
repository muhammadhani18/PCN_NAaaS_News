0,Sports grounds distant dream for youth,"Nine months on, PPP-led local govt fails to improve civic amenities","The aspiration for accessible sports grounds continues to elude the youth of Hyderabad.
Despite the inauguration of key officials belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party on June 19, 2023, in seven out of nine towns in Hyderabad, the promised relief from civic issues remains elusive after nine months.
According to a survey conducted by the Daily Express team, while sports grounds dot the densely populated areas of the city, their neglect and lack of maintenance render them unsuitable for athletic activities.
Former District Nazim Kunwar Naveed Jameel, affiliated with MQM, had initiated efforts to revitalize these grounds, aiming to provide accessible sports facilities to the residents. However, since then, there has been a noticeable absence of upkeep, leading to their gradual deterioration. Presently, the city's playgrounds resemble desolate wastelands.
Hyderabad, with a population exceeding 2.4 million, boasts sports grounds and aspiring athletes. Yet, the indifference of the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and the Department of Sports and Youth Affairs has left these grounds in a state of neglect.
Niaz Stadium, the sole stadium serving Hyderabad and its neighbouring areas in Sindh, remains in disrepair. Despite efforts from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and local municipal authorities, the stadium's infrastructure, including spectator seating and player facilities, remains dilapidated.
Tragically, the deteriorating conditions of these grounds force young enthusiasts and children to resort to playing on unsafe streets and roads, often resulting in accidents and injuries.
Moreover, many of these neglected grounds have become havens for criminal activities, including gambling and drug trafficking. Additionally, the presence of stray dogs further deters people from utilizing these sports facilities.
Dust and debris swirl incessantly throughout the day across various sports grounds such as Mahboob Ground Unit Number Five, Amin Rajput Ground Unit Number Four, Zilpak Ground in Site Area, Municipal Ground Hussainabad, Board Stadium Latifabad, Pakka Qila Ground, and Bagh-e-Mustafa Ground Latifabad, among others. The walking tracks, boundary walls, and iron fences in these areas have suffered significant damage. Reports indicate that boundary walls, like those of Amin Rajput Ground and Mehboob Ground Latifabad, exhibit cracks due to constant exposure to airborne dust and dirt. Similarly, the condition of Zeal-Pak Ground in the Sindh Industrial and Trading Estate (SITE) area is dire.
Despite assurances from the current government of the People's Party, the state of Hussainabad Municipal Ground, named after Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, remains lamentable. 
Despite laying the foundation stone and promising timely completion, successive government terms have failed to realize this commitment. 
After initial efforts to clear the ground of encroachments and install iron grills, neglect and contractor abandonment have resulted in the ground reverting to a sandy wasteland. The costly iron grills are now falling apart, and the ground continues to be misused for parking tractor trolleys filled with sand and gravel.
In 2009, renovation efforts led by Haq-Parast municipal representatives saw the rejuvenation of the scout ground in Latifabad Unit No. 9, including the construction of a jogging track and boundary wall. However, subsequent neglect has left the ground desolate, necessitating the construction of a new boundary wall.
Moreover, sports facilities such as the basketball court in Latifabad Unit No. 6 Nursery Park and the one at Board Stadium suffer from dilapidation. The hockey astroturf ground within the Board Stadium faces destruction due to institutional neglect.
The Pakka Qila ground, once host to numerous national, provincial, and district-level football tournaments, now lies unused due to its uneven surface and accumulated sand. 
Additionally, sewage discharge has resumed on the football ground along GTC Road within the Cantonment Board limits, rendering it unusable for cricket matches despite its popularity among local youth.

4,Urban flooding could be blessing in disguise,"Govt, city authorities, WB experts discuss channelling floodwater to storage tanks","The consultation process for addressing the problem of urban flooding, due to rains in Karachi, has been initiated. In this regard a meeting of stakeholders was held on Monday to find a permanent solution to the problem. 
The meeting, jointly organised by the Sindh Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project (SFERP), the Planning and Development (P&D) Department, and the World Bank discussed the use of flood water for non-potable purposes such as gardening and firefighting by constructing underground water storage tanks which will also help preventing urban flooding in Karachi. 
The meeting was co-chaired by Chief Economist P&D Aslam Soomro, Senior Disaster Risk Management Specialist, World Bank Ahsen Tehsin and Aslam Leghari of SFERP. 
The rainwater causes urban flooding and creates issues of drainage and loss to the properties besides creating traffic issues in the city during the rains.
The participants noted and deliberated upon the use of stormwater for recharging the groundwater or water table. 
It was also highlighted by the participants that groundwater depletion has become a major issue and some areas of Karachi do not have sweet water due to groundwater depletion.

The meeting was told that the project implementation unit SFERP intended to hire a consultancy firm to conduct a feasibility study for the underground stormwater storage facilities aimed at flood prevention within the Karachi division.
The firm so engaged will be tasked to identify locations where inundation events have occurred in the recent past and propose the construction of underground stormwater storage tanks.
The former commissioner Karachi Shoaib Siddiqui speaking on the occasion stressed the need to ensure appropriate inter-organisational coordination for this purpose. 
Consultant World Bank Shahid Sohail, stressed the need of coordination among on-site relevant departments while a KMC representative informed that 514 branch drains need to be cleaned to ensure the smooth flow of sewage water. 
The Chief Economist P&D Aslam Soomro, outlined the need to select the sites which get inundated frequently along with the kind of structures to be built for storage and its effects as it should not cause seepage and affect the existing infrastructures. 
He also offered to form a working group in P&D to ensure coordination among all stakeholders.
Additional Secretary P&D Zubair Channa pointed out that nullahs have been blocked due to encroachments.
He said these channels need to be widened and encroachment removed. He was of the view that the option of recharge tanks can also be considered for storage of flood water.
