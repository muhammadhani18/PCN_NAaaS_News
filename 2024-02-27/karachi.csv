Part of the National Immunization Days, the campaign would continue till March 3.
“This crucial initiative aims to vaccinate around 10.6 million children against poliovirus across all 30 districts of Sindh. Children from the age of six months to five years will be given an additional dose of Vitamin A to boost their immunity,” said an official.
He said around 70,000 dedicated vaccination teams, with almost 10,000 supervisors, were working throughout the province, ensuring that every eligible child received this life-saving vaccine.
“This effort is supported by 3,765 security personnel. We request all schools, hospitals and caregivers to welcome vaccinators, as they truly are fighting on the frontline in the last stages of our battle against this debilitating disease,” he said.
In a message, caretaker Health Minister Dr Saad Khalid Niaz said, “Poliovirus is still here in Sindh and all over Pakistan, threatening the health of children from around the world. It is our resolve to permanently stop transmission of the virus this year.”
Schools, he said, played a pivotal role and it’s im­por­tant that children under five were vaccinated at campuses during the campaign.
In recent reports, 14 positive environmental samples have been isolated from various sites in Sindh, of which 11 are from Karachi, one each from Hyderabad, Jamshoro and Sukkur, with two children infected from UC Gujro, Karachi-East last year.
Pakistan and Afghanis­tan are the two remaining countries, and virus transmission in this block is critical to eradicate polio.

1,"PTI accuses MQM-P, PPP of ‘stealing mandate’ in Karachi",Haleem Adil says his party won 20 of city’s 22 NA seats but ROs changed results in Forms-47.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday blamed the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and Pakistan Peoples Party for “stealing its mandate” in Karachi and Hyderabad and announced that it would launch a movement to mobilise its supporters in order to get back their “stolen mandate”.
Speaking at a press conference here at the Karachi Press Club, PTI leader Haleem Adil Sheikh claimed that independent candidates belonging to his party had won 20 of Karachi’s 22 National Assembly seats and two Hyderabad seats.
The MQM-P had won 15 NA seats in Karachi and two in Hyderabad, while the PPP succeeded on seven NA seats in the metropolis.
Accompanied by PTI-Karachi president Khurram Sher Zaman and others, he said that the upcoming government at the Centre would hardly survive five months.

Haleem Adil says his party won 20 of city’s 22 NA seats but ROs changed results in Forms-47

Commenting on the results of the Feb 8 general elections, he said that the people voted for the PTI and Form-45s were the undeniable proof of its victory.
He said that the party’s iconic election symbol ‘bat’ was snatched and the Election Commission gave strange symbols to our candidates. Even internet service was shut down on the day of polling, but the people still voted for us in a huge numbers.
“The nation gave its verdict in the favour of PTI,” he said, adding: “But the returning officers illegally changed the results in Forms-47.”
The PTI leader said that the party had won 183 NA seats from the country, including 20 in Karachi and two in Hyderabad. “Our worker Arslan Khalid defeated MQM-P chief Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui,” he claimed.
“Our mandate was stolen in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and other cities as well. We will move courts and take back our snatched mandate,” he said.
He said that the PTI would launch a mass mobilisation campaign in the metropolis to thank its voters.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Sher Zaman said the people should boycott “thieves”.
He said that PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had only showed Form-45s of his Larkana seat.
“Our intra-party elections are going to be held on March 3 and after that we will go to courts with evidence as we have confidence in our judiciary,” he added.

2,Rainwater storage facilities planned in city,"KARACHI: In a bid to avoid flooding after rains in Karachi, authorities are toying with an idea to build underground...","KARACHI: In a bid to avoid flooding after rains in Karachi, authorities are toying with an idea to build underground rainwater storage facilities in the city as one of several other proposals to prevent the metropolis from witnessing the crisis after every heavy downpour, it emerged on Monday.
The consultative process for addressing the problem of flooding due to rains in the city was initiated and a meeting of all stakeholders in this connection was held here in Karachi to find out a solution on permanent basis, said a Sindh Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project (SFERP) statement.
“The rainwater causes urban flooding, creating problems including health, drainage and loss of property besides creating traffic issues in the city,” it said.
“The meeting discussed the idea of flood water to be reused for non-potable purposes such as gardening and firefighting by constructing underground storage water tanks, which will also help in prevention of urban flooding in Karachi.”
“Discussion regarding use of storm water for recharging the ground water/water table was also focused. It was also highlighted by the participants that ground water depletion has become a major issue and some areas of Karachi do not have sweet water due to ground water depletion,” it said.
The project implementation unit of SFERP, the statement added, intended to hire a consultancy firm to conduct a feasibility study for the underground storm water storage facilities aimed at flood prevention within the Karachi Division.
“The firm so engaged will be tasked to identify locations where inundation events have occurred in the recent past and propose construction of underground storm water storage tanks,” it added.
Special Secretary-Planning Zubair Channa told Dawn that there were enough open places in the city where wells could be made to store rain water.
He said two or three places in district Central were earlier used for storing rain water some 20 years ago. “These facilities still exist, but are not being used,” he said, adding that a study would be conducted to use these facilities to prevent urban flooding.

3,"Interim CM Baqar, health minister in shouting match at Sindh cabinet’s farewell meeting",Dr Saad accuses caretaker CM of threatening him; spokesperson says chief minister did not want any confrontation on last day.,"KARACHI: The farewell meeting of the outgoing caretaker cabinet took an ugly turn on Monday when Chief Minister retired Justice Maqbool Baqar and Health Minister Dr Saad Khalid Niaz exchanged words and reportedly accused each other of going beyond the defined mandate of the caretakers.
However, a statement issued by the CM House did not mention any untoward incident during the sitting and suggested that all went well in the farewell meeting.
But soon after the meeting, social media platforms were abuzz with reports of a scuffle between the caretaker CM and health minister during the meeting of the provincial cabinet.
In a bid to present his side of story, the health minister called reporters to his office and shared with them what had really happened in the cabinet meeting.
“During the meeting, I told the cabinet that the health department couldn’t work as per requirement during caretaker administration,” Dr Niaz said.

Dr Saad accuses caretaker CM of threatening him; spokesperson says chief minister did not want any confrontation on last day

“Hearing this, the chief minister became angry at me. He turned louder and even used bad words for my father. I told him that it’s not appropriate. He threatened me in front of other cabinet ministers. I possess right to move court against him for threatening me,” he added.
The health minister claimed that he ‘tried his best’ to work properly with all due honesty but was never allowed to do so.
When contacted, a spokesperson for the caretaker CM told Dawn that when the health minister started talking about his problems Justice Baqar told him that it was not appropriate to raise such issues especially on the last day of the caretaker cabinet.
History of differences
However, the news of a bitter exchange of words between the two did not come as a surprise for many people.
Since the very beginning of the caretaker set-up, differences had cropped up between Justice Baqar and Dr Niaz over several issues.
First, the health minister had opposed procurement of robots for surgery for government hospitals and issued instructions for the cancellation of a multibillion-rupee tender. However, the CM threw his weight behind the procurement and this created a serious rift between them. The health minister accused the CM of ‘interference’ in his department and had also boycotted a meeting held at the CM House to review the performance of his department.
Later, another issue surfaced when Dr Niaz had written a letter to the chief secretary asking him to take immediate action against the secretary of the health department because he had approved a summary on the orders of the CM House regarding a Rs2.27 billion annual financial grant to an NGO without consulting him.
Baqar lauds efforts of his cabinet members
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the CM House said that the caretaker chief minister chaired the farewell cabinet and expressed best wishes for the incoming provincial government.
He also lauded the efforts of his cabinet members for trying their level best during the interim period. The chief minister and cabinet members, the statement said, also attended lunch with senior officials and the staff of CM House.
“I am very proud that you all made efforts with sincerity and dedication,” the statement quoted the CM as saying. “Thanks to Allah Almighty that elections were held and the new government is about to take charge. We pray for the new government to perform for the people and wish it all the best.”
The CM, while approving the minutes of the cabinet meeting, appointed retired Justice Nazar Akbar as the chairman of the Commission for the Protection of Journalist and other Media Practitioners.

5,"Notices issued on plea to probe mishandling of bodies, plane wreckage after PK-8303 crash",SHC asks petitioner’s lawyer to advance arguments on maintainability on March 18.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Monday issued notices to the ministry of aviation, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and others on a petition seeking a probe by a joint investigation team (JIT) into the alleged negligence in handling the wreckage and bodies of 2020 Karachi plane crash victims.
A PIA domestic flight, PK-8303, originated in Lahore on May 22, 2020 had crashed in Model Colony near Karachi airport killing 97 of the 99 passengers and crew members on board.
Yaseen Abdul Fattah Elaayi, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, petitioned the SHC and submitted that his father, Abdul Fattah Elaayi who was also a US national, was among the victims of PK-8303.
Citing the aviation ministry, PIA, CAA and Sindh Forensic DNA & Serology Laboratory as respondents, he submitted that the respondents had failed to preserve and deliver the belongings of his father.
He said the victim’s body was also not handed over to him due to flawed forensic results.

SHC asks petitioner’s lawyer to advance arguments on maintainability on March 18

When a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi took up the matter for hearing, the petitioner’s lawyer submitted that despite the lapse of a considerable time the respondents had not yet returned the belongings of his client’s father, which were shown to him after a DNA test.
He stated that there seemed to be no policy or standard operating procedure formulated by the respondents with regard to returning the belongings of deceased passengers to their legal heirs in case of such an eventuality.
He stated that the petitioner had been approaching the respondents since the air crash, but got no response whatsoever.
He maintained that though the petitioner had been duly compensated, he was also entitled to have possession of the belongings of his late father.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench issued pre-admission notices to the respondents as well as deputy attorney general for March 18 with a direction to file reply/comments, if any, before the next date with advance copy to the lawyer for the petitioner.
The bench in its order also said, “However, learned counsel for the petitioner may come prepared on the next date of hearing and to assist the court as to maintainability of instant petition as prima facie, it appears that claims of the petition may require evidence, whereas considerable time has also been lapsed.”
The petitioner stated in the petition that despite providing all identification documents to confirm his status as the rightful legal heir of the deceased, the respondents told him that the belongings could not be handed over to him due to an alleged family dispute.
He said he had also clarified to them that his father had divorced Ms Naboulsi many years prior to the incident.
He also submitted that after the air crash, he had travelled to Pakistan to fulfil responsibilities including providing DNA samples for identification of his father’s body, making burial arrangements and collecting his personnel effects.
However, the petitioner maintained that on June 3, 2020, he came to know that forensic results had been flawed due to negligence and incompetence of the Sindh Forensic DNA & Serology Laboratory, located at Karachi University.
Thereafter, the petitioner stated that he was taken to a morgue, where the body planned to be handed over to him as of his father’s, was found to be of Shabbir Kadir Chamdia.
The petitioner told the court that he was shocked to learn that his father’s body was handed over to another family that buried him.
He stated that he was denied the right to perform last rites of his late father.
The petitioner sought belongings of his father, publication of final investigation report and formation of a JIT to probe alleged negligence of the respondents.

Zaman Town SHO Rao Rafiq said four suspects riding two motorcycles snatched cell phones from two brothers, Baber Husain and Waqar Husain, when they were standing outside their house in Korangi 2 ½ late on Sunday night. Later, they snatched a cell phone, cash of Rs5,600 and other valuables from another citizen, Abdul Ahad, at around 9.30pm while he was talking to someone on phone outside his home in Korangi-4.
However, Ahad took out his licensed pistol and opened fire on the suspects when they were fleeing. He fired around 11-12 bullets, as a result of which, two suspects died on the spot while their two accomplices managed to escape, the SHO added.
In the meantime, a police mobile van arrived there and shifted the bodies to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for medico-legal formalities. 
The deceased were identified as Abdul Khaliq and Abdul Rehman. The police claimed to have recovered the snatched cash and cell phones from their custody.
The police registered three separate cases against them on complaints of two robbery victims and one on behalf of police over possession of illegal weapons.

His father told the media at the JPMC that after receiving the information of the incident, he along with other relatives visited the crime scene in Korangi. He said the police at the JPMC had told him that they found his son dead on the road.
The relatives of the other killed suspect, Abdul Rehman, refused to talk to the media at the hospital.
The SHO claimed that both the killed suspects were ‘robbers’ who looted the citizens and were killed by one of the robbery victims. 
The police claimed that both the suspects had also been identified by the two robbery victims, who had testified that the same suspects had looted them.

On Feb 3, the victim had left his workplace and was on way home in Baldia Town when he slipped and fell in the nullah within the jurisdiction of SITE-B police station. Later, his body was found a short distance from the place of the incident. He was the father of five children. 
Victim’s widow Noorul Ain sought over Rs37m as damages under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855, from the KMC over the death of the husband.
The applicant pleaded before Senior Civil Judge Jamaluddin Siyal that the defendant KMC was responsible for cleaning sewerage lines and nullahs in Karachi, according to the relevant rules and regulations of the corporation. But the defendant failed to clean and maintain or cover them and their negligence caused the death of her husband.
Her counsel Advocate Usman Farooq contended that despite being fully aware of the hazardous condition of the open nullahs, the KMC failed to take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk, thereby breaching their duty of care owed to the public.
The counsel also argued that deceased Syed Fakhr-i-Alam was 55-year old, very fit and having robust health and used to care much for the plaintiff and his five daughters, and wanted to see them in a prosperous state.
He argued that the victim could have survived up to the age of 70 in view of the long life span in his family pedigree, advancement in medical facilities, availability of medical treatment and the good climate of the area from where he belonged.
He submitted that after his demise, the plaintiff and her daughters had been left alone and suffered huge losses.
He pleaded to the court to decree the sum of Rs37,108,200 against the defendants to pay as damages/compensation to the plaintiff.
The court was also pleaded that the profit/markup at the rate of 21 per cent per annum might also be paid to the plaintiff.
However, the court is likely to take up the issue after verification of its jurisdiction.

According to what Ruqayya, six-year-old daughter, of the couple Fida Hussain Shah, 32, and Mehrunnisa, 25; their niece, 8, and cousin Razi Shah, 22, told relatives and police who reached the scene after the tragedy, the man and wife were returning home in Tando Mitha Khan in their car after a healing session with a soothsayer in Tando Adam, when they stopped on the canal bridge to throw a talisman into the water as directed by the healer.    
Mor Shah, cousin of late Fida Shah, told reporters that Mehrunnisa was going through some mental problems, hence the couple went to see a healer in Tando Adam. 
Probably not satisfied with him, they decided on their way back home to meet another spiritual healer who handed them the talisman and directed them to throw it into a canal or river, he said.  
The couple’s cousin Razi Shah, who was sitting in the car’s back with the children, informed the family that Fida stopped the car on the canal’s bridge and the couple got out to carry out the healer’s direction. 
When they were walking back to the car, Fida said to his wife in a lighter vein how unlucky they were that in such a blessed night they were roaming about for her treatment rather than praying to God. It would have been better if she had died, Fida said as they sat back in their seats, Mor said quoting Razi. 
He said that probably the casually uttered but insensitive remark cut her to the quick and she replied that she would jump and die then and there. 
Without warning, she jerked open the door before he could stop her, rushed out and jumped over the railing into the canal, he said. 
He said that Fida did not commit suicide he jumped after his wife to save her but could not rescue her and drowned. 
Sanghar SHO Ali Akbar Khokhar reached the scene along with his team and called divers, who managed to take out the body of Fida Shah whereas his wife’s body was recovered near Kandiari. The bodies were shifted to hospital for autopsy. 
Police officials said that further investigation was under way.
