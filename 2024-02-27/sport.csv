0,Modric stunner helps Real extend lead at top,MADRID: Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric came off the bench to net a stunning strike from the edge of the box late...,"MADRID: Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric came off the bench to net a stunning strike from the edge of the box late in the second half to secure a 1-0 home win over Sevilla on Sunday and stretch their lead at the top of La Liga to eight points.
It takes Real to 65 points ahead of Barcelona, in second after they beat Getafe 4-0 on Saturday, and nine in front of third-placed Girona before they host Rayo Vallecano late on Monday.
Atletico,  who lost 1-0 in the Champions League last 16 first leg tie at  Inter  Milan in midweek, remain fourth, 13 points off leaders Real
It was a compelling encounter with Real, who dominated possession in the first half, having an early Lucas Vazquez effort ruled out by VAR for a foul in the build-up.
But they were often exposed on the counter and Andriy Lunin had to save several times used his feet as a sweeper keeper.
Sevilla goalkeeper Orjan Nyland had himself put in an almost perfect performance until the 38-year-old Modric latched onto a rebound and blasted an unstoppable curling shot that shaved the post on its way into the net after 81 minutes.
He made two outstanding one-handed saves to deny efforts by Vinicius Jr and Federico Valverde, who also hit the post with a close-range strike early in the second half.
Jet-heeled winger Vini­cius was a constant menace on the left and forced Nyl­a­nd to make another brilliant one-handed stop to keep out a curling strike by the Brazilian in the 56th minute.
Real had almost 65% possession and 16 goal attempts against four by Sevilla, who were kept on level terms by Nyland’s heroics with six superb saves before Modric secured the points.
“It takes a lot of practice every day, every day,” Modric told DAZN regarding his stunning winner. “You can see me practising shooting at goal for hours every day... In football you have to shoot, I did it today and it went in.
“Persistence is one of our strengths, we never stop, we insist, we create and we look for it until the end. We knew that we couldn’t let the points slip away from us today because Barcelona had come so close and we couldn’t let that happen.
“That insistence throug­hout the match paid off. These are three very impo­rtant points for this league.”
The result leaves Sevilla in 15th spot with 24 points, six points above the relegation zone.
Earlier, Athletic Bilbao failed to take advantage of Atletico Madrid draw at bottom side Almeria as they lost 3-1 against Real Betis after Athletic’s stri­ker Nico Williams was sent off with two quick yellow cards just before halftime.
Athletic remained fifth, three points behind Atlet­ico while Betis moved to sixth.
Elsewhere, relegation thre­­­atened sides Cadiz, 18th, and Celta Vigo, 17th, played out a 2-2 draw at Estadio Nuevo Mirandilla.

1,Leaders Inter cruise to victory at Lecce with Martinez double,LECCE: Inter Milan remained on course for their 20th domestic title as they stormed to a 4-0 win at Lecce in Serie A...,"LECCE: Inter Milan remained on course for their 20th domestic title as they stormed to a 4-0 win at Lecce in Serie A on Sunday after two goals by captain Lautaro Martinez helped them maintain their nine-point lead at the top of the table.
Inter, whose other goals came from Davide Frattesi and Stefan de Vrij, restored their advantage at the top with a game in hand over second-placed Juventus, who beat Frosinone 3-2 earlier on Sunday to reach 57 points from 26 matches.
Simone Inzaghi’s injury-hit side, who remain the only Serie A team yet to lose on the road this season, extended their winning streak in all competitions to 10 games.
First-choice goalkeeper Yann Sommer was missing through illness, with Emil Audero coming in to make his Serie A debut for Inter, while Marcus Thuram, Juan Cuadrado and Francesco Acerbi were all sidelined with injuries.
Inter began with a heavily rotated squad as midfielders Hakan Calhanoglu and Nicolo Barella were rested from the starting lineup.
That, however, did not pose a problem, as Martinez put Inter ahead in the 15th minute, beating two defenders to latch onto a neat pass from Kristjan Asllani and strike low from the edge of the box for his 100th goal in Serie A.
Inter then scored three times in 13 minutes, starting with Frattesi, who doubled their lead after the interval as he netted at point-blank range.
In a great team move, Martinez sent a pass to Alexis Sanchez deep inside the box and the Chilean squared the ball to Frattesi for a simple finish in the 54th minute.
Martinez added the third two minutes later, netting from a Frattesi pass across the box which the Argentine striker sent into the bottom corner first time.
De Vrij completed the rout with a towering header from a Dimarco corner in the 67th to leave Lecce 14th on 24 points.
Meanwhile, Teun Koopmeiners’ penalty just before the halftime helped Atlanta secure a 1-1 draw against Atalanta.  
Rafael Leao ended his goal drought which stretches back to September as he rifled home the opener from a tight angle after nifty  footwork.
The 24-year-old has scored three times and set up two  more in his last six games in all competitions but Sunday was another  slip for third-placed Milan after last weekend’s chaotic defeat at  Monza.
Fifth-placed  Atalanta have a game in hand and can go fourth if they defeat Inter on Wednesday. They are two points behind Bologna and seven behind  Milan.
In Sunday’s other fixture, Daniele Rugani forced home a stoppage time winner as  Juventus defeated Frosinone in Turin to end a worrying four-match  winless run.
Defender Rugani managed to get his boot on Dusan  Vlahovic’s flick-on from a corner in the fifth and final minute of  injury time and get Juve, in second, going in the right direction.
Elsewhere, Victor Osimhen’s second goal in a matter  of days wasn’t enough to reignite Napoli’s hopes of European football  as Zito Luvumbo struck in the 96th minute to snatch a 1-1 draw for  Cagliari and leave Napoli ninth.

2,PSG’s Ramos replaces Mbappe and nets late equaliser against Rennes,PARIS: Paris St Germain striker Goncalo Ramos came off the bench to replace Kylian Mbappe and rescued a point for ...,"PARIS: Paris St Germain striker Goncalo Ramos came off the bench to replace Kylian Mbappe and rescued a point for the Ligue 1 leaders with a last-gasp penalty that salvaged a 1-1 draw against Stade Rennais at Parc des Princes on Sunday.
PSG, now unbeaten in their last 18 Ligue 1 matches, have 54 points from 23 games and an 11-point lead over second-placed Stade Brestois.
Mbappe, linked with a move to Real Madrid, had an uneventful night before being taken off in the 65th minute.
The France captain, who leads the Ligue 1 scoring charts this season with 21 goals, made way for Ramos, who was brought down by goalkeeper Steve Mandanda for the penalty.
Rennes, who could have extended their winning streak to seven matches, took the lead in the 33rd minute after a bursting run by Amine Gouiri who slotted into the top-right corner.
They looked set to walk away with all three points before Ramos converted his spot kick in added time to level the scores. PSG were handed the penalty following a VAR review.
Rennes, who are seventh with 35 points, travel to fourth-tier club Le Puy Foot 43 Auvergne in the Coupe de France quarter-finals on Thursday. 
United States international Folarin Balogun put Monaco ahead  after just 19 minutes. Minamino then doubled the lead on the half-hour.Meanwhile, Nice drew 0-0 at home with bottom-club Clermont Foot and are a point behind in fourth.
In Lens, AS Monaco jumped to third, two points further behind, on Sunday when Japan  striker Takumi Minamino scored in the second minute of added time to  give them a last-gasp 3-2 win at RC Lens.
Lens struck back through Elye Wahi and Wesley Said levelled in the 77th minute.
The hosts, who lost at Freiburg in the Europa League on Thursday, faded in the last 10 minutes.
Home goalkeeper Marcin Bulka  threw himself to his left at the end of the first half to save a penalty  from Shamar Nicholson. It was Bulka’s fourth save from six penalties he  has faced in all competitions this season.
Nice have one win in their last six games.
Elsewhere, Lille’s poor away form continued as they threw  away a half-time lead to lose 3-1 at Toulouse, who ended their own winless  home run.
Lille took the lead in added time with a goal from Hakon Haraldsson.
Toulouse hit three goals in a 17-minute burst. Christian Mawissa levelled following a corner in the 49th minute.
Substitute Yann Gboho won a penalty eight minutes later that another half-time replacement, Vincent Sierro, converted. Gboho then set up Thijs Dallinga for the third in the 66th minute.
In the late game, Marseille came from a goal behind to beat Montpellier 4-1 for a first league win this year.

3,Australian Open final loss easy to get over: Medvedev,DUBAI: Daniil Medvedev said on Monday it was  “easy” getting over his Australian Open final defeat by Jannik...,"DUBAI: Daniil Medvedev said on Monday it was  “easy” getting over his Australian Open final defeat by Jannik Sinner, unlike his reaction to his loss to Rafael Nadal at the same stage two years ago.
Medvedev blew a two-set lead in both the 2022 and 2024 Australian Open finals, but while he is  “still disappointed” about the result against Nadal, he feels good about his performance against Sinner last month.
“To be honest, ‘get over’ was quite easy. As I said after the match, I felt like it would be easy because I played a great tournament, I played a good final,” Medvedev told reporters in Dubai.
The Russian world number four will be contesting his first tournament since the Australian Open this week in Dubai, where he is the defending champion.
Medvedev skipped his title defence in Doha last week because he was dealing with a number of physical issues — with his foot, adductor, and shoulder — but feels ready to get back on court after spending the last seven days training in Dubai.
Medvedev, who opens his campaign against Alex­ander Shevchenko on Tuesday, has added French former world number six Gilles Simon to his team, to collaborate with his long-time coach Gilles Cervara.
“I thought about Gilles Simon for many different reasons. He knows tennis well. You can see it. He was able to beat me and make me feel not good on the court,” said Medvedev.

DORTMUND: Borussia Dortmund suffered a 3-2 defeat at home to Hoffenheim after a second-half double from Maximilian Beier on Sunday left the hosts’ hold on fourth place in the Bundesliga in jeopardy.
Dortmund remain on 41 points, one clear of RB Leipzig in fifth, and six adrift of third-placed VfB Stuttgart, who played out a 1-1 home draw with Cologne on Saturday.
Hoffenheim opened the scoring after two minutes when Ihlas Bebou stole the ball from the Dortmund defence to run into the box and slot home from a tight angle.
Dortmund grabbed the equaliser in the 21st through Donyell Malen’s close-range volley after a corner flicked on by Marco Reus and Nico Schlotterbeck’s towering header off a free kick made it 2-1 to the hosts four minutes later.
Beier equalised in the 61st minute with a deflected shot from the edge of the box and the 21-year-old scored his second three minutes later with a tap-in to restore the visitors’ lead.
Dortmund captain Emre Can came close to a stoppage-time leveller but his close-range header went wide as his side fell to their first defeat in 2024.
Hoffenheim are seventh on 30 points after 23 games.
Earlier, Omar Marmoush scored in stoppage time to snatch Eintracht  Frankfurt a point in a 2-2 home draw against his former club VfL Wolfsburg.
Frankfurt came from a goal down to equalise twice, with Egyptian striker Marmoush landing the crucial blow in the dying stages.
The draw heaps pressure on Wolfsburg manager Niko Kovac whose side are without a win since mid-December.
In Sunday’s late game, Augsburg scored tw­i­ce in the  final 20 minutes for a 2-1 win over Fre­i­burg, lifting the home side from  15th to 11th.
Freiburg captain Vincenzo Grifo opened the scoring after 19 minutes with a penalty, his 13th straight spot kick.
Felix  Uduokhai tapped in a rebound to equalise after 72 minutes with Arne  Engels scoring nine minutes later, sliding the ball in at the near post.

5,Paris holds its breath for Olympic swimming events in murky Seine,The city of Paris has insisted “there is no plan B”.,"PARIS: Organisers of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris may be feeling a little queasy over their commitment to hold open water swimming in the scenic but often polluted Seine.
Last August, the marathon swimming test events were cancelled because the water was too dirty, as were the swimming legs on two of the four days of triathlon and para-triathlon tests.
The city of Paris has insisted  “there is no plan B”.
The course for the men’s and women’s 10-kilometre events will start at the iconic beaux-art Pont Alexandre-III and, with the Invalides and Eiffel Tower in the background, head 1km down river past other famed attractions, including the Musee d’Orsay, and the Grand Palais.
Perhaps appropriately, it passes the newly-renovated Paris Sewer Museum and the more minimalist Pont d’Alma before looping back. The triathlon swims are shorter and will turn back sooner.
It is a route chosen to showcase the beauty of Paris.
It is also politically symbolic: swimming has been banned in the Seine since 1923 but various Paris mayors have vowed to open it up.
In 1990, when he was mayor before becoming French president, Jacques Chirac promised the river would  “soon” be clean enough in which to swim and that he would celebrate by taking a dip. He never did.
The current mayor, Anne Hidalgo, a vigorous promoter of green initiatives, has also promised she will take the plunge before the Olympics start and that the public will be allowed to swim at three locations by 2025. She has yet to get her feet wet.
City officials argue that the quality of the water has improved, but none of the samples collected between June and September 2023 met European standards on the minimum quality of water for swimming.
The big problem is faecal matter. The bacteria in the water increases sharply when heavy rain sweeps debris and untreated wastewater into the river from the banks and the overflowing drains and sewers.
The city tests the water at 14 points. In 2022, water quality at three of them was judged to be  “sufficient” but had deteriorated by last summer.
The open-water swimming last Aug­­ust was cancelled after heavy ran sent E. coli readings to six times the target level set by World Aquatics (FINA).
The city of Paris insisted they had  “learnt” from the sampling problems at the test events.
National and local authorities are also investing 1.4 billion euros (more than $1.5bn) in five projects designed to clean the water.
According to a Paris city official, the failed tests for the team triathlon and, two weeks later, the para triathlon swimming were caused not by rain but by a  “valve malfunction” in the Paris sewage system.
The weather remains the  “main risk”, acknowledges the Paris town hall, which fears  “exceptional rainfall”.
The only backup plan for the swimming is postponing the events by a few days.
“There is no solution to move the event, the triathlon and open water swimming will be held in the Seine next year,” Tony Estanguet, Paris 2024 organising committee, said after the cancellations last August.
For the athletes these are the Olympics and dirty water is a constant risk in open-water competitions.
At the end of the test event in 2019 ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, swimmers protested against the quality of the water in Tokyo Bay. Before the Rio Olympics in 2016, the polluted Guanabara Bay made headlines.
“A glittering setting,” Italian double world champion Gregorio Paltr­inieri told Italian media in January.  “Even if the water is dirty, I would rather swim in an electric atmosphere in the centre of Paris than in an anonymous stretch of water.”
After winning silver at the world championships in Qatar earlier in February, Frenchman Marc-Antoine Olivier said he was excited by the venue.
“People may be afraid of what’s in the water, but swimming in a historic place is going to be incredible,” he said.  “Of course, a lot of people are going to try and create a bit of a buzz about the conditions we’re going to have in the water, but if we can swim then there’s no problem. They won’t take the risk of us swimming and someone catching something.”
The triathlons could become ‘duathlons’ as some did last summer.
“It would be a shame but we adapted to a duathlon,” said Briton Beth Potter, who won the individual test event.

6,Sultans’ Ali shrugs off comparisons ahead of Qalandars clash,Says he focuses on playing his own game and fulfilling the role assigned to him by the team management.,"LAHORE: Multan Sultans pacer Mohammad Ali, who is currently leading the fast bow­ling charts of the HBL Pak­istan Super League with 13 wickets, has emphasised that he always strives to play his own game rather than co­m­paring himself with others.
Speaking to reporters after a training session at the LCCA ground here on Monday, on the eve of their match against the struggling Lahore Qalandars, Ali stated that he doesn’t see his performance as a competition with other players. 
Instead, he said, that he focused on playing his own game and fulfilling the role assigned to him by the team management.
Ali played a significant role in propelling Multan Sultans to the top of the points table with eight points from five matches. He expressed confidence in his team’s balance and read­iness to face the Qala­ndars on their home ground.
Ali also dismissed the notion that transitioning from red-ball cricket to white-ball cricket was difficult, emphasising the impo­rtance of red-ball cricket in player development.
Meanwhile, Aaqib Jav­ed, the head coach of Lahore Qalandars and a former Test bowler, expressed disappointment over losing the services of paceman Haris Rauf, who was ruled out of the remaining matches of the PSL due to a shoulder dislocation suffered in the match against Karachi Kings on Saturday.
Aaqib highlighted the absence of key players like Haris and spinner Rashid Khan due to injury but remained hopeful that the Qalandars, despite the setbacks, possessed a strong bowling line-up. 
He expressed optimism that the team would bounce back from recent narrow def­eats and perform better in upcoming matches to stay in contention for the playoff stage.
Multan Sultans’ skipper Mohammad Rizwan along with batter Reeza Hendr­icks are among the top-four batters of the tournament, reflecting the team’s strong performance across all departments. 
Despite losing a match to Peshawar Zalmi, the Sult­ans managed victories agai­nst Islamabad United, Lah­ore Qalandars, and Karachi Kings at their home ground. The upcoming match will mark their first away game of the season.
For Lahore Qalandars, who have lost all five matc­hes so far, a victory against the Sultans is crucial to stay in contention. Their batter Rassie van der Dussen’s century against Zalmi made him the top-scorer with a total of 270 runs, marking the first century of the current edition of the PSL. Additionally, Qalandars ope­ner Sahib­zada Farhan holds the fifth position am­­ong the top-scorers. The Qal­­andars, however, need opener Fakhar Zaman to regain form, with the Paki­stan international having managed only 66 runs from five matches. Captain 
Shah­een Shah Afridi, as the pace spearhead, also needs to lead by example.­

7,HBL PSL 2024: Ton-up Babar makes the difference as Zalmi prevail despite Azam blitz,Babar had seen his partners fall one after the other and Zalmi’s hopes rested on him to provide the final flourish after they had been put into bat by Islamabad United.,"LAHORE: Babar Azam knew he had to lead the charge for his team and on Monday, he showed a different side to his game. Never the player who goes for unconventional extravagance that has become the hallmark of the Twenty20 game, the Peshawar Zalmi skipper showed he can mix flair with his finesse.
The crowd at the Gaddafi Stadium, which chanted the name of their homegrown superstar every time he faced the ball, was witnessing Babar version 2.0. Even Zalmi coach Darren Sammy shook his head with a wry smile at what he was seeing.
Just days after a video went viral in which Babar was seen reacting angrily towards fans who shouted ‘ZimBabar’; a moniker given to him on social media for scoring big runs against less illustrious opposition like Zimbabwe, the former Pakistan captain showed he can do it all.
Babar had seen his partners fall one after the other and Zalmi’s hopes rested on him to provide the final flourish after they had been put into bat by Islamabad United.
Having launched Nase­em Shah for a six down the ground in the previous over, the right-hander, known for his elegance, cut loose in the 18th bowled by rookie Hunain Shah. Babar moved across the stumps and carted the ball for four over fine leg before hitting a six on the second ball.
The third ball met the same treatment as the first, Babar once again finding the fine-leg rope. He would smash two more boundaries off the next two balls to mo­ve closer to his century and drive Zalmi towards 200.
Babar had completed his half-century off 39 balls but moved to 99 off 57 when he cut away Tymal Mills for four to start the 18th over and then jumped for joy by bringing up his ton two balls later.
The best, and perhaps the most outrageous, of his 14 fours was probably his last, which came off the penultimate delivery when he shaped to paddle but adjusted late to dab it away to the point boundary.
Babar finished with a majestic 111 not out of 63 balls, helping Zalmi post 201-5 — a target that proved beyond United despite the best efforts of Azam Khan (75) and Colin Munro (71), who pulled their side close but departed in an explicable late collapse.
In the end, Babar’s ton, and his late acceleration, proved crucial. His decision to turn to spinner Arif Yaqoob to bowl the penultimate over also proving decisive as the spinner picked up four wickets off those six balls to finish with 5-27 as United fell short by eight runs in a game they seemingly had in the bag and have now lost three in a row.
Zalmi, on the other hand, have now won three on the bounce after opening the HBL Pakistan Super League season with a pair of losses.
They got off to a fast start against United; Saim Ayub, opening with Babar, following his 88 a day earlier against Lahore Qalandars, hitting a brisk 38 off 21, featuring three fours and two sixes — one of them a no-look hit off Tymal Mills.
But after the 77-run opening stand was broken, Saim missing a sweep off Agha Salman to see his stumps shattered, Zalmi lost two more for the addition of just five runs; Shadab Khan getting both the wickets in one over.
The United captain first held on to sharp return on the second attempt to send back Mohammad Haris and then trapped Haseebullah Khan lbw.
Zalmi endured a 28-ball boundary drought which was duly ended by Babar, who raised his half-century in the 13th over.
But after Paul Walter (19) was run out after a mix-up in the middle and Rovman Powell didn’t last long, Babar provided a grandstand finish to the innings with Asif Ali chipping in with an unbeaten 17 off nine balls.
United started the chase with purpose and reached 32 when opener Jordan Cox (13) missed a slower one by Luke Wood and saw the ball crash into his stumps.
But Cox’s opening partner Munro stayed defiant in the face of falling wickets. Shadab departed after miscuing spinner Arif Yaqoob to Saim, who hit back with venom to dismiss Agha Salman, who had hit him for a six and four off the previous two deliveries.
Having arrived with United in a spot of bother at 73-3 halfway through the 10th over, Azam provided a twist in the tale. With a sensational display of power-hitting, and with able support from Munro, he was looking to take his side over the line.
In a remarkable 30-ball blitz, he smashed a whopping six sixes and seven fours, putting away the Zalmi bowlers to all parts with utter disdain.
Munro also got on the act, hitting seven fours and a six in his 53-ball knock, and when Azam effortlessly hacked away Naveen-ul-Haq for six on the fifth ball of the 18th over, United looked primed to finish off the contest with 21 more runs required off 13 balls.
Azam, however, fell on the last ball of that over as he tried to go big down the ground, setting the stage for the drama at the end.
Munro tried to hit Arif out of the park the very next ball and ended up getting stumped and Babar jumped for joy two balls later when Haider Ali holed out in the deep. Arif would finish with two wickets on the last two balls of his spell as Faheem Ashraf’s revese sweep went straight to the fielder and Hunain was pouched by Powell.
United required 19 off the last over and although Naseem slammed Salman Irshad for six off the second ball, Babar completed the win for his side by taking the catch to see the end of Imad Wasim with two balls to go.

8,PSB recommends Athletics Federation of Pakistan to ban secretary from travelling as manager,The recommendation came after two Pakistani athletes failed to participate in the Asian Indoor Athletics Championship despite being present in the host city.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) has been advised to ban Athletics Federation of Pakistan (AFP) general secretary retired Lt. Col Shahjehan Mir from travelling with athletes as manager for future international events.
The recommendation came on Monday from a three-member committee, which was set up to probe a recent controversy which saw two Pakistani athletes fail to participate in the Asian Indoor Athletics Championship despite being present in host city Tehran.
The committee, headed by PSB director general Mohammad Shahid, pointed out negligence on the part of the AFP, hence directing action against Shahjehan.
“The PSB may not recommend to issue NOC in favour of Lt Col (retired) Shahjehan Mir Secretary General of AFP as ‘Manager’ with athletic team participating in the international competition,” read the inquiry report. “It also recommended that PSB may also direct AFP to immediately initiate an inquiry and execute stern action against responsible person as per provision made in AFP’s constitution. Report of inquiry may be shared with PSB and Ministry of Inter Provincial Coordination.”
The committee also pointed out that PSB may issue directions to all national sports federations to frame terms and references of the managers proceeding abroad with their athletes to participate in the international competition followed by capacity building program to avoid such untoward incidents in future.
“PSB may also direct all NSF to state the role of Manager and other officials in the PSB’s Per­forma for sending Pakistan Sports Teams/Spo­rts Person abroad,” the inquiry committee recommended and stated that this matter may be reported to the PSB’s board in its next meeting.
Last week, after terming AFP’s response unsatisfactory, the PSB on Thursday formed the committee to probe the non-participation of Shajar Abbas and Jaffar Ashraf in the Championship.
Sources said the AFP’s secretary told the probe committee that due to the shifting of the Technical Information Centre from the hotel to the stadium, which was one and half hour drive away, he reached there in the second session but entries of the two athletes were rejected.
He also told the committee that athletes of two other countries faced similar situation. However, the committee pointed out that in case the TIC was shifted from the hotel to the stadium, the manager should have reached there well on time to register the said athletes.

Chasing 192 for victory, India slipped to 120-5 but Gill (52) and Jurel (39) put on an unbeaten stand of 72 to achieve the target during the second session in Ranchi.
The win gave India an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series after they lost the first Test.
“It’s been a very hard-fought series, so to come on the right side of it feels very good,” India’s skipper Rohit Sharma said. “A lot of challenges were thrown at us, but we responded.”
It was the first series defeat for captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum since they took charge in 2022 and changed England’s fortunes with their attacking philosophy dubbed  “Bazball”.
“It was a great Test match, the scoreboard doesn’t give enough credit to the game as a whole, the ebbs and flows,” Stokes said, adding that he  “couldn’t be more proud” of his spin bowlers.
“So much credit to our spinners, being exposed to a situation like that at the start of their careers,” Stokes said.
Gill played the anchor in his 124-ball knock as he and Jurel, who made 90 in India’s first innings, staved off a mini-crisis when Shoaib Bashir took two wickets in two balls soon after lunch.
UNDER PRESSURE
India still needed 72 more but Gill and Jurel rotated the strike coolly to pick off singles before the former raised his fifty with two successive sixes off Bashir.
“We were put under pressure... but Jurel came out and took the pressure off, he saw the situation and played accordingly,” Gill said.
He praised captain Sharma for his support, saying he  “gave us the confidence to go out and play with freedom”.
Jurel hit the winning runs, punching the air and hugging his partner as the Indian dressing room rose to celebrate.
India started the morning strongly with Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal extending their overnight 40-run opening stand to 84.
Joe Root made the breakthrough in his first over of the day, as he induced Jaiswal, on 37, to loop a catch to a diving James Anderson at backward point.
Rohit reached his half-century but fell for 55, caught behind by wicket-keeper Ben Foakes off Tom Hartley’s left-arm spin.
He was initially ruled as stumped, but it was later changed to caught behind.
England’s travelling army of fans then erupted when Bashir, who took his maiden five-wicket haul in the first innings, had Rajat Patidar brilliantly caught by Ollie Pope for a duck to leave India 100-3.
After the interval, Bashir silenced the home fans with his twin strikes to give England some hope of an unlikely win.
Ravindra Jadeja slapped a full toss to Jonny Bairstow at mid-wicket and Sarfaraz Khan tickled the next ball to Pope at backward short-leg for a duck, but Jurel survived the hat-trick ball.
England had scored 353 all out in their first innings and led by 46 after India’s 307.
Indian spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav set up the victory after they shared nine second-innings wickets to bundle out England for 145 on day three.
England had recovered from 112-5 in their first innings courtesy of Root’s unbeaten 122.
India were without pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who was rested, but the bowling stood up — including debutant quick Akash Deep, who took three early wickets after England elected to bat.
Anderson reached 698 Test wickets in the match and needs two more to become only the third bowler to 700 after Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan (800) and late Australia spin wizard Shane Warne (708).
The fifth and final Test begins on March 7 in the Himalayan hill town of Dharamsala.
“We turn up to every Test thinking we want to win,” Sharma said, adding he was  “confident we will put on a good show” for the last match.
