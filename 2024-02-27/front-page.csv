• ECP takes up SIC’s request for reserved seats today
• Hearing on Nawaz’s plea about NA-15 seat set to resume
ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on Monday had to summon the maiden sitting of the lower house of parliament at 10am on Feb 29, after President Arif Alvi refused to summon the session on account of an ‘incomplete house’.
In response to a summary by the Parliamentary Affairs Division last week, the president said the lower house was not complete, so he could not summon the session as requested. His dilly-dallying also invited the ire of political parties, with the PML-N and PPP asking the president not to abuse his powers as the head of the state.
Observers believed he wanted to delay the session till the issuance of a notification by the Election Commission of Pakistan regarding the reserved seats of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which the bulk of PTI-backed lawmakers have joined.
 
 

Under the Constitution, the first session of the National Assembly is required to be convened within 21 days after the general elections held on Feb 8. Section 91(2) of the Constitution says: “The National Assembly shall meet on the twenty-first day following the day on which a general election to the assembly is held, unless sooner summoned by the president.”
According to a senior official of the National Assembly Secretariat, the president is duty-bound to call the session of the NA within 21 days; otherwise, the secretariat itself could announce the session. He said the secretariat had made all necessary arrangements for the new assembly’s first session.
The NA secretariat official told Dawn that under the 18th Amendment the president was bound to call the NA session within 21 days.
He said that that clause was incorporated in the Constitution after late military dictator Pervez Mush­a­r­raf in 2002 had delayed convening the NA. He said an “incomplete” NA did not allow the president to halt its proceedings.
“The president is waiting for 10 reserved seats of women of SIC, but he has forgotten that more than that number of seats have been vacant as many returned candidates contested polls from more than one constituency,” he said.
Meanwhile, the media wing of the National Assembly Secretariat has invited mediapersons to cover the first session of the 16th National Assem­bly on Thursday.
ECP open hearing
Meanwhile, the Election Commission of Pakistan has decided to hold an open hearing on the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) plea seeking allocation of the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies on Tuesday (today).
The decision was taken at a meeting of the commission held on Monday with Chief Election Com­m­i­ssioner Sikandar Sultan Raja in the chair. The ECP will also hold a hearing about the petition, filed by convener MQM-P, against the proposed allocation of seats to the SIC.
Last week, Moulvi Iqbal Haider also filed a petition, seeking to ‘restrain the political party Sunni Ittehad Council being treated as parliamentary party’. This petition along with other related petitions will also be taken up for hearing today.
These include the plea of Mehmood Ahmad Khan seeking to get certified copies of a merger between the PTI and the SIC and the affidavits submitted in favour of the SIC by the PTI-supported members of national provincial assemblies.
Nawaz’s plea
Meanwhile, the ECP adjourned the hearing on a petition filed by PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif regar­ding the NA-15 Man­sehra constituency till Tuesday.
Both Nawaz Sharif’s lawyer Barrister Jahangir Jadoon and independent candidate Gustasab Khan’s lawyer Babar Awan appeared before the bench. Mr Jadoon maintained that the returning officer’s report had not been given to them and that without reading the report, they could not give arguments.
To this, Babar Awan said that the report of RO was received by everyone. Gustasab Khan won with a lead of 25,000 votes and according to the law, if there was a difference of 25,000, then the recount could not be done. He said the ECP had stayed the issuance of notification of the returned candidate.
CEC Raja said the stay could not be extended for mere arguments as the ECP wanted to end the stay as soon as possible. The CEC directed Mr Jadoon to present arguments on Tuesday. CEC Raja said that an interim order would be issued on the request to end the stay, as the stay could not be postponed indefinitely.
Mr Sharif’s lawyer said the results of 125 polling stations were not included in Form 47, with the CEC Raja responding the RO had rejected the claim that the votes of 125 polling stations were not included in the report.
Advocate Babar Awan said that while compiling Form 47, no one went to the office of the returning officer. After hearing the arguments from both sides, the Election Commission adjourned the hearing and directed to give more arguments today (Tuesday).

• Sworn in with Nawaz, Shehbaz by her side; new chief minister vows to change fate of province
• Promises inclusive growth, protection for women, better hospitals and policing
• SIC members walk out after speaker denies floor to CM candidate Rana Aftab
LAHORE: Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, achieved a historic milestone by becoming the first woman chief minister of Punjab, on Monday.
In her maiden speech in the Punjab Assembly, she pledged not to ind­ulge in political victimisation and, instead, wou­ld seek the opposition me­m­bers’ positive invol­v­ement in the running of government affairs.
Ms Nawaz secured 220 votes in the 371-member house, amid a boycott by her competitor, Rana Aftab of the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council.
Mr Aftab told the media outside the assembly building that they would not accept this election and would consider moving a court of law against the ‘bulldozing’ of the democratic process.
Ms Nawaz, the ‘rookie’ parliamentarian, will now be faced with the daunting task of overcoming a resilient PTI in opposition, a weakened PML-N-led coalition at the Centre, and an economy in turmoil.
She stepped into politics in 2012, when she was made in charge of PML-N’s election campaign in Lahore for the 2013 polls, which were won by the PML-N.
She was subsequently appointed chairperson of the PM’s Youth Loan Scheme by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif but resigned in 2014 when her posting was challenged in the high court.
Ahead of 2018 polls, she and her father were imprisoned in a corruption case days, before the election but secured bail from a high court after some months, eventually leading to her acquittal in 2022. She was appointed the party’s senior vice-president and, later, chief organiser in 2023.
Terming her win on Monday an honour for each “mother, sister and daughter of the country”, she promised to accept the mandate of all parties. Commenting on the absence of the opposition, which had walked out of the house, she recalled that her party had never left any field open to the government of the time, despite all the victimisation it had suffered.
“The atrocities inflicted by the rivals, in fact, helped me learn a lot and strengthen my resolve,” she said, without naming the former ruling party.
Swearing in Ms Nawaz was sworn in at a “grand but solemn ceremony at the sprawling lawns of the Governor’s House” later on Monday, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
In a break from tradition, the oath-taking was held not inside the Darbar Hall, but on the laws of the sprawling gubernatorial mansion on The Mall. According to APP, the ceremony was moved outdoors to accommodate more guests on the occasion.
The oath was administered by Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman, with Ms Nawaz’s father, Nawaz Sharif seated next to her.
Her uncle and former three-time Punjab CM Shehbaz Sharif was also present. During the oath-taking, Ms Nawaz placed a photo of her late mother, Kalsoom Nawaz, in front of her.
Five-year agenda
Explaining her five-year agenda, she said there would have zero tolerance for corruption and harassment of women, adding that a helpline to get direct feedback from the public would be established instead of relying merely on official reports.
She said reliable data of “deserving people” in Punjab would be collected through a survey to be conducted within three months, and relief goods would be delivered at their doorsteps during Ramazan. Price control committees would be made effective immediately, she added.
For the youth and students, she promised scholarships, fee reimbursement schemes, interest-free loans to set up small businesses, skills training, laptops, electric bikes, as well as a proper school transport system across the province.
In the health sector, she said an air ambulance would be introduced within 10 weeks, free medicine would be provided at all emergency wards in Punjab, a motorway ambulance service would be made functional shortly, the health card scheme of 2015 would be revived, and a state-of-the-art hospital with all major facilities would be established in each city within five years.
Day-care centres would be set up, a safe environment would be provided to working women and minorities, Ms Nawaz said, who also announced digitalising the provision of 43 basic services to be offered to the citizens on one phone call.
After five years, she said, there would be no intercity and intra-city road in shambles, while metro bus service would be introduced in all divisional headquarters.
She promised to cut the police response time to five minutes in case of any eventuality and resolved to establish safe city projects in 18 cities.
She also promised the provision of solar panels on instalments, construction of 100,000 homes for the poor, clearing of garbage within a month, provision of farm tools at a subsidised rate to small farmers, and establishment of agri centres for agriculture loans, quality seeds, and fertilisers. “I promise to leave Punjab in a much better condition than now after [my] five years.”
SIC walkout
Earlier in the day, house proceedings began after a delay of 30 minutes from the scheduled time of 11am.
As Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan called for ringing the bells for two minutes to begin the process of electing the chief minister, SIC nominee for the coveted slot. Rana Aftab, sought permissioner to take the floor on a point of order.
But the speaker declined, arguing that he has to first complete the official agenda. At this all SIC MPAs, 96 of them, walked out of the house in protest.
The chair then sent Khawaja Salman Rafique, Imran Nazeer, Samiullah, Khalil Tahir Sindhu, and Ali Haider Gilani to bring the protesting MPAs back. On their return, the SIC members again sought floor and on denial by the speaker boycotted the election process and again walked out of the house.
This time, the chair decided to continue the election process even in the absence of the SIC MPAs and asked the assembly staff to close the entrances of the hall after ringing bells for two minutes. The women members were directed to first cast their votes to be followed by the male members.
When all members had cast their votes and gone out to the lobbies, bells were rung again for two minutes before counting of the cast votes.
Before the voting, two MPAs Khizar Hussain Mazari and Tahir Qaisarani took their oath, which was administered by the speaker.

2,SC seeks religious opinion on Feb 6 judgement,"Seeks assistance of religious institutions, including the Council of Islamic Ideology.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has sought the assistance of religious institutions, including the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), with a directive to furnish statements on its Feb 6 judgement in the Mubarak Ahmad Sani case.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a three-judge Sup­reme Court bench on Monday took up the Pun­jab government’s review petition against the verdict which overturned the conviction, by the Lahore High Court, of Mr Sani on charges of distributing proscribed literature.
The court also issued notices to Jamia Darul Uloom Karachi, Jamia Imdadia Faisalabad, Jamia Naeemia Karachi, Jamia Muhammadia Gho­usia Bhera, Jamia Salafia Faisalabad, Jamiatul Multazir Lahore, Jamia Urwat-ul-Wusqa Lahore, Quran Academy Lahore and Al Mawrid Lahore.
The court advised other organisations or individuals desiring to give their opinions, to do so in writing before the next hearing.
The court ordered registration of an application moved on behalf of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) seeking to become a party in the case on a request by counsel Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui. The counsel said JI beli­eved that the court did not receive “proper assistance” before reaching a conclusion in the matter.
The court was seized with a review petition filed by the Punjab government with a plea that an observation in the Feb 6 verdict needed modification because religious freedom, as envisaged in Article 20 of the constitution, was not absolute and subject to law, morality and public order. Article 20 ensures freedom to profess religion and to manage religious institutions.
In the judgement, the SC had stressed that the Holy Quran does not speak of compulsion in religion and the Constitution had laid down freedom to practise religion as a fundamental right.
The provincial government argued that it was aggrieved by the judgement since the conclusions were based on an “erroneous assumption of the material facts”.
Mr Sani, the respondent, was named as an accused in an FIR registered in Chiniot on Dec 6, 2022, under Sections 295-B and 298-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), as well as Section 9(1A) of the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) Act 2011. He faced charges of distributing literature that could “hurt religious sentiments”.
On June 24 last year, the trial court framed charges against Mr Sani under Sections 295-B and 298-C of PPC and Section 9(1A) of the act.
The accused filed an application for deletion of the charge before the trial court, but it was dismissed on Sept 25.
Mr Sani challenged the order before the Lahore High Court, but the LHC also dismissed his plea on Oct 16.
He challenged the high court’s order through a criminal petition before the Supreme Court, which was allowed on Feb 6.

3,Nepra okays record fuel cost adjustment after govt ‘arm twisting’,Defers probe into Discos’ performance till after Ramazan; performance report carries no mention of any accountability of Discos or their staff.,"ISLAMABAD: Days after ordering a probe into the record fuel cost adjustment (FCA) demanded by distribution companies, the power regulator appr­o­ved the hike, which will put an additional strain of Rs55 billion on electricity users.
In a remarkable turnaround on its proclamations, the National Electric Power Regulatory Autho­rity (Nepra) notified the additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs7.06 per unit on Monday.
The amount will be cha­rged from consumers of ex-Wapda distribution com­panies (Discos) for electri­city consumed in January.
Last week, the Discos sought an FCA of Rs7.13. Astonished by the dem­and, the regulator announ­ced an investigation and said no decision would be made until the probe was concluded.

Defers probe into Discos’ performance till after Ramazan

According to sources, the government warned the regulator that such a route would create cash flow problems for the discos and affect performance benchmarks committed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at a crucial time.
Nepra was reportedly asked to follow the routine of timely judgments over FCA demands and defer the probe.
Subsequently, the regulator gave in and postponed the inquiry until after Ramazan.
A Nepra notification stated that the additional cost of Rs7.056 will be applicable to all consumer categories except Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and lifeline consumers.
“The said adjustment shall be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the month of January 2024 and reflect in the billing month of March 2024,” the document added.
According to the calculation, the FCA will yield about Rs55bn in additional funds to the Discos.
The Discos, through the Cen­tral Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), demanded an additional FCA of Rs7.13 per unit for the electricity consumed in January.
The CPPA claimed that the fuel cost for January was set at Rs7.49 per unit, but the actual cost was Rs14.62.
In its notification, the power sector regulator reiterated that it had taken “strict notice” of the public concern over “the enormous increase in the fuel cost” and had “decided to initiate an investigation to ascertain the reasons”.
“The Authority has further decided to evaluate the performance of each Disco individually after the month of Ramazan on whether any violation … has been committed.”
The power regulator said a notice for the probe and appointment of investigation officers would be issued later.
During a hearing on Friday, Nepra Chairman Waseem Mukhtar and member tariff Rafique Shaikh wondered why the Discos sought such a massive increase in tariff when there had been no change in fuel price and exchange rate and despite an average eight-hour loadshedding.
“We also have to face our conscience”, Mr Mukhtar said during the meeting and said the regulator can’t allow whatever costs the power companies want to charge consumers. “Nepra should not be considered a rubber stamp”.
Highest ever FCA
The Rs7.06 per unit FCA is the highest ever and almost 96pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs7.50 per unit already charged to consumers in January.
This calls into question the capabilities of the power sector bureaucracy to forecast fuel costs even for a six to seven-month period.
These charges are on top of around 26pc increase in annual base tariff and another 18pc hike under quarterly tariff adjustment already in place.
As a result, consumers continue to pay excessive bills despite minimum consumption in peak winter months.
‘No accountability’
As it signed off the record FCA, Nepra also released discos’ performance evaluation report for FY2022-23.
The document lists a litany of shortcomings but carries no mention of any accountability of Discos or their management and staff.
The Nepra said it would also issue “certain directives” to each Disco and grid operator to be placed before their boards of directors for approval of a viable plan to improve their performance and ensure compliance with targets and benchmarks.
It also directed the energy ministry to submit the Power Purchase Price forecast and Discos to file their annual indexation/adjustment request for FY2024-25.
It also asked the ministry for a proposal to address the issues of system stability, South-North evacuation and system constraints, among other issues, to increase electricity demand that had plummeted due to unaffordable tariffs.It noted that the grid operator — National Transmission and Despatch Company — attributed high fuel cost to higher utilisation of thermal power plants “not because of any system constraints but to ensure system stability and reliability, owing to unprecedented weather conditions, very low demand and south-north evacuation issues”.

4,"IHC admits Imran, Bushra, Qureshi’s appeals for hearing","CJ-led division bench seeks trial record of cipher, Toshakhana cases by March 7; puts FIA, NAB on notice.","ISLAMABAD: Admitting appeals of ex-premier Imran Khan, his spouse Bushra Bibi and ex-minister Shah Meh­mood Qureshi against their convictions in the cipher and Toshakhana cases, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday requisitioned record related to the trial court proceedings by March 7.
The PTI founder and the ex-minister were sentenced to jail for 10 years in cipher case by a special court. In the Toshakhana reference, the ex-premier and his spouse were awarded 14 years’ jail term each.
Both appeals were taken up for hearing by a division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar and Barrister Salman Safdar represented Mr Khan in the cipher case.
 
 

Barrister Safdar argued that there were serious anomalies in the procedure adopted to convict the PTI leaders in the cipher case. He said the Special Court (Official Secrets Act) bypassed the law and deprived Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi of remedy available in law for their defence.
According to the appeal, the arrest of Mr Khan and hearing for remand took place in the “most objectionable, clandestine, and secretive manner” on Aug 16, last year. The prosecution did not share complete record and the judge indicted the PTI leaders in haste. Owing to the glaring illegalities, the appeal mentioned, an IHC bench scrapped the proceeding twice. Yet Judge Abual Hasnat Zulqarnain concluded the trial without complying with the mandatory procedural requirements, it claimed.
The appeal claimed that the ex-PM and his legal counsel “extended all the cooperation” to the trial court and did not seek unnecessary adjournment. But the judge did not ensure fair trial, as “the proceedings were hurried through by the court in breakneck speed for reasons known only to the court itself”, it argued, pointing out that the trial was “concluded in less than 20 days”.
While one of the defence counsel could not appear before the court as he had to rush to Lahore for dental surgery, the court appointed state counsel for Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi despite strong objection by the PTI leaders, according to the appeal. Both leaders requested the court to make a call to their lead counsel in order to seek his assistance during cross-examination, but the trial court refused to wait for him.
The appeal claimed that the cipher case trial was then shifted to a “secret room” and concluded within a very short span of time.
Objections overruled
The IHC division bench also took up applications seeking suspension of their sentences till the final adjudication of the main appeals against their conviction. At the outset, the bench overruled the objections to the petitions raised by the registrar office.
Also in Toshakhana case, Barrister Zafar argued an accountability court convicted the ex-PM and his spouse without even giving them right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.
While issuing notices to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in the cipher case and National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in Toshakhana reference, the high court later adjourned further proceedings on the appeals and applications till March 7.
Meanwhile, the IHC bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri issued notice to the NAB on the plea of the PTI founder and his wife seeking post-arrest bail in 190 million pounds corruption case.
Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, Advocate Sardar Latif Khan Khosa said the trial court decision that dismissed the bail applications of the petitioners was ‘erroneous’ and requested the IHC bench to accept the bail pleas.

5,Murad comfortably lands third straight term in office,"• Sindh CM-elect gets 112 votes against MQM-P nominee Khurshidi’s 36 • JI, PTI-backed MPAs boycott vote; GDA trio skips session","

• Sindh CM-elect gets 112 votes against MQM-P nominee Khurshidi’s 36
• JI, PTI-backed MPAs boycott vote; GDA trio skips session
KARACHI: Pakistan Peoples Party candidate Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday comfortably won the election of the chief minister of Sindh for a third consecutive term in a one-sided contest against Ali Khurshidi of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), as his opponents stayed away from the polling.
He secured 112 votes in the 168-member house, while his opponent only managed 36. Nine independent members backed by the PTI and one Jamaat-i-Islami lawmaker, present in the house, did not take part in the voting. Three members of the Grand Democratic Alliance skipped the session.
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori is scheduled to administer the oath to CM-electe Murad Ali Shah at 6pm on Tuesday (today) in a ceremmony to be held at Governor House.
During the election of the CM, the PTI-backed MPAs, who have officially joined the Sunni Ittehad Council, gathered in front of the rostrum holding placards. They sat back on the insistence of Speaker Owais Qadir Shah after chanting slogans decrying the “rigged elections”.
‘Not an easy decision’
In his first speech as CM-elect, Murad Ali Shah paid tributes to the party leadership for leading the party and trusting him with this position, saying that it was not an easy decision.
Mr Murad Shah said that ending terrorism, operations against dacoits in riverine areas, and curbing street crimes to improve law and order were among his priorities. He said that ensuring access to clean drinking water and education for the people of the province were also among his top priorities.
Talking about the 2024 polls, he said that the PPP had many reservations about elections but it decided to adopt a legal way forward. “We will not compromise on the sovereignty of the country for a handful of seats and we will not allow anyone to take advantage of our weaknesses,” he said, adding that the country was currently facing a tough time and needed stability more than anything else.
Mr Murad Shah thanked the lawmakers who voted for him and acknowledged that abstaining from the polling was also a part of politics, which some members had chosen to do. He urged all lawmakers to engage in assembly proceedings in a productive manner.
Learning from past mistakes
Murad Ali Shah also acknowledged the importance of not repeating any mistakes made by his administration in the past. Recognising that some individuals had criticised the PPP’s electoral strategies, he said, “It is the party’s performance that earns votes.”
He also underscored the importance of uniting behind Bilawal’s leadership, asserting that the party chairman represented the “future of Pakistan”. He reiterated his belief in Bilawal’s potential to become the prime minister in the next general elections. “We are committed to serving the people of the province for the next five years,” he concluded.
Earlier, former Sindh education minister Syed Sardar Shah extended his congratulations to Murad on securing a third term as chief minister. “He has been elected for the third consecutive term due to his outstanding performance in office,” he said.
Abdul Wasim of the MQM-P also congratulated CM Murad. “The mindset and approach of this administration should be leveraged for the benefit of the province,” he said. He said that MPAs elected from the province were responsible for living up to the expectations of the people of their constituency. “I trust Murad Ali Shah will meet these expectations,” he added.
Others who also spoke on the occasion and congratulated the CM-elect in the House included PPP’s Muhammad Bux Mehar, Agha Siraj Durrani, Imdad Pitafi, Jam Khan Shoro, Marvi Fasih, Sharjeel Memon, Nuzhat Pathan, Qaim Ali Shah, and Faryal Talpur, Taha Ahmed and Ali Khurshidi of MQM-P, Muhammad Farooq of JI and PTI-independents Sajjad Soomro and Rehan Rajput.
Seasoned politician
Born in Sehwan Sharif in Jamshoro district, the CM-elect is a civil engineer by profession. After his graduation from the NED University, he joined the Water and Power Development Authority as an engineer.
He joined the Port Qasim Authority as an executive engineer and later went to the United States where he studied structural engineering and economic engineering from Stanford University.
He also served as a director of the Fish Harbour Authority. Before 2013 general elections he was declared ineligible to contest the election as he possessed dual nationality.
He later surrendered his Canadian nationality and after getting clearance from a court, he contested a by-election and became a member of the Sindh Assembly again in 2014.
He was elected as the chief minister for the first time in 2016 when the PPP decided to replace Syed Qaim Ali Shah. In 2018, he was elected as the Sindh chief minister for a second time.
No decision on governors
Separately, PPP leader Sherry Rehman termed reports regarding the appointment of governors by the PPP baseless.
“There is no truth to the rumours circulating on various media forums regarding the appointment of governors by the PPP,” said Ms Rehman.
In a statement on Monday, she assured the public that the process of shortlisting and finalising candidates for the crucial role of governors in provinces will be conducted under the direct oversight Asif Ali Zardari once he assumes the presidency.
