0,PM Kakar halts official duties,Says caretakers now only awaiting the oath-taking of elected government," 
Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has ceased official tasks and returned all pending summaries awaiting his approval, citing the imminent swearing-in of the new federal government.
Kakar said all pending decisions and summaries will now be deferred to the incoming government. “We are simply awaiting the new government’s inauguration,” he stated. “Furthermore, we will provide the new administration with a comprehensive briefing on our activities and projects.”
Controversy arose over the National Assembly's inaugural session on Sunday when President Dr Arif Alvi declined to green-light its commencement apparently due to non-allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
The SIC, a lesser-known political entity, emerged as the major party in the National Assembly and the provincial legislature of Punjab after independent candidates affiliated with PTI joined it last week.
The standoff escalated as the PML-N argued that, following the February 29 deadline expiration, the NA speaker could independently convene the session. However, a former Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) official dismissed this assertion.
The caretaker parliamentary affairs ministry had sent President Alvi a summary urging the NA session's commencement on Monday.
Despite the plea, President Alvi invoked his constitutional authority to delay the session by 15 days, expressing concerns about the completion of the reserved seats allocation process.

1,New charge d’ Affaires to India takes charge,Observers believe that the latest scenario diminished the chances of any rapprochement between the two neighbours,"Pakistan’s new head of diplomatic mission in India formally took charge in New Delhi on Monday amid little prospects of any breakthrough in the bilateral relationship.
""Today, Saad Ahmad Warraich assumed responsibilities as Charge d' Affaires at the Pakistan High Commission, New Delhi. He has replaced Aizaz Khan, who has completed his tenure"", the Pakistan High Commission posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Warraich served as the Pakistani envoy at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. He was working as director general of Afghanistan, Turkey, and Iran at the Foreign Office. Notably, Asad Gilani has now been assigned the new responsibility of DG Afghanistan.
Pakistan downgraded the diplomatic ties with India after New Delhi unilaterally revoked the special status of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region in August 2019. Since then the two countries have not restored their diplomatic relationship.
The last Indian High Commissioner to Islamabad was Ajay Bisaria, who was expelled as a result of Pakistan’s decision. Last year, India appointed Geetika Srivastava as the first woman Charge d' Affaires at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.
Observers believe that the latest scenario diminished the chances of any rapprochement between the two neighbours.

2,NEC approves guidelines for PSDP allocations,Says special attention needed for underdeveloped districts,"The National Economic Council (NEC) has approved the policy guidelines to include highly underdeveloped areas in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan provinces in the priority list for fund allocation under the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) in the upcoming budget 2024-25.
In a recent meeting, the NEC also directed that funds allocation should be made for water projects in line with the true spirit of the National Water Policy.
The council observed that funds allocation is primarily made on a geographic basis. However, since population is also considered an important factor for fund allocation, it should be considered one of the criteria for selecting areas for PSDP projects.
Earlier, the NEC was informed that the selection of underdeveloped areas/districts in the country was based on criteria determined by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).
It was observed that the highly underdeveloped districts of Balochistan and K-P, including the newly merged areas of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), had not been included in the list of twenty least developed districts, while some relatively less underdeveloped districts had been included.
The most deprived districts of Balochistan as well as the newly merged areas of K-P needed special attention, particularly in education, health, and infrastructure.
It was suggested to revisit the criteria for selecting the least developed districts for PSDP-funded projects. Furthermore, it was noted that provinces are also responsible for uplifting their underdeveloped districts.
Therefore, there was a proposal to share information regarding provincial annual development program (ADP) allocations and expenditures for these districts with the NEC.
The NEC was informed that many areas of Sindh were greatly affected by the 2022 floods, which needed special attention for rehabilitation.
It was suggested to explore financing options from the International Fund for Climate Change for development projects, for which feasibility studies were required.
The federal government had allocated funds in the PSDP for water-related development projects in light of the National Water Policy, but such allocations were missing in the ADPs of provinces.
There was a dire need for provinces to adhere to the National Water Policy and allocate sufficient funds in their ADPs for this purpose.
The formulation process of the PSDP began with the issuance of the PSDP Call Circular (PCC) to ministries/divisions/provinces in January each year, subsequent to the issuance of the Finance Division's Budget Call Circular.
The PSDP Call Circular contained necessary guidelines, criteria, and formulas for inviting project-wise budgetary proposals for inclusion in the next financial year's PSDP.
It was noted that the funds demanded by Ministries/Divisions were consistently higher than the Indicative Budget Ceiling (IBC) conveyed by the Ministry of Planning. Therefore, certain guidelines needed to be followed, and priorities needed to be set for effective allocation of development funds.""

4,SC seeks evidence of bias in Bhutto hanging case,"Lengthy judgment in criminal case unprecedented in history, remarks CJ","A nine-judge larger bench of the Supreme Court has raised concerns regarding the unusually lengthy judgment in the case of the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto four decades ago. The bench, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, solicited evidence from lawyers to demonstrate potential bias among the judges involved.
This hearing pertains to a presidential reference against the Supreme Court's decision leading to the execution of former prime minister Bhutto in 1979. Initiated by then-president Asif Zardari twelve years ago, the reference remains under scrutiny.
Chief Justice Isa queried whether any previous criminal case had yielded a 935-page judgment, while Justice Jamal Mandokhel suggested that the extensive detail might indicate disagreement among the judges who authored it.
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, also on the bench, emphasized the necessity of presenting evidence from the court record to substantiate claims of judicial pressure or biased decision-making.
Late Bhutto was convicted in the murder case of Muhammad Khan Kasuri by the Lahore High Court (LHC), over a year after the toppling of his government by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq. Later Bhutto’s appeal against his conviction was rejected by the Supreme Court through a 4-3 split verdict.
Bhutto’s Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) always contended that the party founder and the country’s first elected prime minister was falsely convicted and hanged. During the PPP government from 2008-13, the then president sent a reference to the apex court to review the case and acquit Bhutto.
During the hearing, the chief justice remarked that when decision of the Bhutto case was reserved, two important developments took place: the then chief justice became the acting president, and that he praised Ziaul Haq for his efforts to enforce Islamic system in the country.
Amicus curie Khalid Javed Khan told the court that had the judiciary been independent at that time, Bhutto would not have been hanged. At that time, he pointed out, there were ad hoc judges in the Supreme Court and thousands of people were put in jails, even some people were hanged.
Also sitting on the bench, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood asked how the court could examine bias without invalidating a judicial decision. He also wondered how could the court move forward without overturning those decisions and whether the court should set aside judgments of the trial court and in the revisions.
Khalid Javed Khan mentioned a judgment authored by Justice Athar Minullah, which said that the decision to hang Bhutto was not correct. On that, Justice Shah said that now it came as a declaration. Later, the hearing was adjourned until Tuesday (today).

5,Bilawal predicts legal battles ahead for Alvi,PPP chief hopes Shehbaz to be elected PM unanimously; urges politicians to respect each other,"Painting a bleak future for Dr Arif Alvi after leaving the top public office of the country next month, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the president failed to fulfil his constitutional responsibilities and would face legal challenges.
Talking to the reporters after attending the hearing of the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s presidential reference at the Supreme Court, Bilawal thanked the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for the unhindered elections of the chief ministers of Sindh and Punjab.
The PPP chairman expressed the hope that with the cooperation of these two parties, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif would be “unanimously” elected as the prime minister of the country.
“We are grateful to the Sunni Ittehad Council and the PTI, as they allowed Maryam Nawaz and Murad Ali Shah to be elected as the chief ministers of their respective provinces unopposed. Shehbaz Sharif is now on his way to unanimously being elected as the prime minister, and the credit goes to the two parties mentioned,” he told reporters.
Bilawal said that Alvi did not fulfil the responsibility of being president.
“He (Alvi) will now face many legal challenges, beginning with the night that he violated the Constitution and dissolved the (National) Assembly [in April 2022] despite the no-confidence motion,” he said.
“Now, he has again violated the Constitution and failed to fulfil his duty to convene a session of the National Assembly,” he added, while referring to the president’s returning of the summary for the inaugural session of the lower house of parliament.
In remarks about the prevailing political situation in the country, the PPP chairman said that the politicians needed to respect each other, emphasising that many issues facing the nation would resolve automatically if the politicians decided to put an end to their egos and internal grudges.
He defended the PPP’s choice of joining the PML-N to form a coalition government at the Centre. He said that the party joined the alliance to pull the country out of economic crisis, strengthen democracy, and bring stability to the country.
“It [the PPP] could have chosen to remain nonchalant about the entire situation. The onus was not on the PPP to form the government, owing to its numbers [in the National Assembly], but the country’s economy, democracy, stability, and the Federation were all at stake,” he said.
“This compelled the PPP to take a decision. The PPP decided to engage with the party it was approached by. The other party in this case, the Sunni Ittehad Council, did not approach the PPP for votes to begin with, so now they cannot object to someone else forming the government,” he said.

“They [the SIC] made no efforts to do so by themselves. They made the decision to not engage with us themselves. We were then left with the option to engage with the party that approached us. The PPP will continue to provide [the PML-N] with its input through the parliamentary system.”
When asked about the enormity of the prevailing situation, Bilawal stressed that “more democracy” was the only solution to the problems of the people. At the same time, he underscored the importance of the “process of reconciliation” but added that it was difficult to carry out.
“At the time of the Charter of Democracy, both parties [the PPP and the PML-N] accepted their shortcomings and derived a future course of action. The PTI’s problem is that it refuses to accept its own mistakes and does not believe in the Constitution, democracy, or the system,” he said.
He referred to a news conference by PPP Co-chairman Asif Zardari after the Feb 8 general elections, in which he mentioned that the PTI could be a part of the reconciliation process.
“However, till date, the PTI refuses to admit its own faults,” Bilawal added.
When asked about his electoral promise of releasing all the political prisoners, Bilawal said that it was, in fact, the PPP’s aim after coming to power, “but the PPP is now in the position to make a proposal of it as advice” to the next government.
The PPP chief told reporters that the people of Sindh gave a historic mandate to the PPP for its performance in the province. About the appointment of new governors, he said that Zardari would shortlist the names of governors after he is elected president.
“The process has not yet begun.”
When asked about the role of the establishment, he said: “If we wish for the judiciary, the establishment, and other institutions to work within their domains, it is the politicians of the country that first need to understand the importance of engaging within their political boundaries. Otherwise, we cannot expect our judiciary, media, or any other institution to stay within their limits.”
Speaking about the proceedings in the presidential reference earlier in the day, Bilawal said that the court had been informed by amici curie about various aspects of the case. He added that every lawyer, who appeared in court, had “produced a mountain of evidence” about miscarriage of justice.
“They are proving that there was no judicial process or trial, but Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s assassination. Evidence is being presented before the court rapidly,” he said. “We hope that justice will be served at last and that the blot on the institution will be washed off.”

6,Vawda considers responding to 'Buzdar 2’s servant’ insult,"Says if any credible individual raises political query concerning Buzdar 2, I will certainly address it","Former federal minister Faisal Vawda on Tuesday responded to comments made by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Uzma Bukhari, stating that he considers it beneath him to engage with what he referred to as a ""servant"" of Buzdar 2, a nickname he uses to refer to Maryam Nawaz, the newly elected Punjab chief minister from the PML-N.
“I consider it an insult to respond to Buzdar 2’s servant. If any credible individual raises a political query concerning Buzdar 2, I will certainly address it,"" Vawda conveyed via his official social media account, alongside an old video featuring Azma Bukhari.
On the content of the shared video, Vawda urged the PML-N leadership to pay attention to Azma's remarks within the footage.
“It is a matter of one-and-a-half years that the Hudabiya (Paper Mills case) and Ittefaq foundries case will be reopened. It is not my assertion, but that of the individual herself, levelling accusations against the PML-N leadership,” he elaborated.

On Monday, the former minister had strongly criticised Maryam Nawaz for adopting a disrespectful attitude towards a prominent women leader of PML-N, Uzma Kardar, during the provincial assembly session.
Vawda addressed Maryam Nawaz as “Buzdar 2”, saying: “Instead of learning a lesson from the political fall of Mian Sahib and fearing Allah, ‘Buzdar 2’ is showing arrogance and contempt. It's as if the US dollar has depreciated to 200 against the rupee, petrol is available for Rs150 a litre, and roti is selling for Rs5.
“This Buzdar 2 has been elected by only 98 votes. If the guardians of the law and Constitution open the ballot boxes, then she would only be able to show such attitude in her Raiwind palace and not in the Punjab Assembly,"" he further stated.
