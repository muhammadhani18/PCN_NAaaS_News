0,Spat in Senate over Alvi’s refusal to call NA session,PML-N lawmaker seeks amnesty to legalise black money to boost economy.,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday witnessed a war of words between PPP and PTI lawmakers over President Dr Arif Alvi’s refusal to summon the inaugural session of the National Assembly.
Former Senate Chairman and PPP leader Mian Raza Rabbani accused President Alvi of not only violating the Constitution but also trying to derail the democratic system.
Speaking in the House on a point of public concern, Senator Rabbani said that the Presidency was openly violating Article 91 of the Constitution, which binds the president to summon the session of the NA within 21 days of the general polls. “It is very unfortunate that the Constitution is being subjected to terrorism, and the latest attack on it is unfortunately from the Presidency,” said Senator Rabbani.
He added that the president, throughout his tenure, had been violating the Constitution during different periods. Senator Rabbani expressed surprise that the president was taking an unconstitutional step by refusing to summon the NA. He added that caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar had sent a summary to the president under Article 48 of the Constitution to summon the session, which was time-bound.

PML-N lawmaker seeks amnesty to legalise black money

He underlined that the president had to act in accordance with the advice of PM.
“President is part of the parliament under Article 58 of the Constitution and I, through the floor of the house, would like to convey to him not to violate the Constitution and summon the session to ensure that democratic process continues in the country,” he said.
In an instant retort, PTI Senator Saifullah Abro said that seasoned politician Mr Rabbani should first advise the ECP to allocate reserved seats to SIC.
 
 

He pointed out that the issue was the main cause behind the president’s refusal to summon the lower house of parliament. He added that the provincial assemblies in Punjab and Sindh had elected their chief ministers, but SIC has not been allocated reserved seats there. “All parties should ask the ECP to allocate these reserved seats to PTI-backed SIC,” he said, adding that the president would then immediately summon the session.
Senator Abro said that the ECP was bound to upload Form-45 on its website within 14 days of the election under Clause 95 of the Elections Act 2017, but the electoral watchdog has failed to do so despite the passage of 18 days. He added that the electoral watchdog was violating the law. He advised other parties that they should censure the ECP instead of the president.
Black money
“The black economy should be given a way,” PML-N lawmaker and former chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Pir Sabir Shah said while speaking on a motion. The motion was moved by Senator Mushtaq Ahmad of JI to discuss the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which, according to a World Bank report, was the worst in Asia despite the fact that these entities receive a huge amount of Rs458 billion annually from the government.
Another highlight of the day was a call by a PML-N senator for the introduction of an amnesty scheme allowing the whitening of black money to boost the national economy.
Senator Shah referred to the recovery of billions of rupees earned by corrupt means by bureaucrats and businessmen and said while the white economy was on a downslide, the black economy was flourishing. He said the black money stashed in godowns and houses should be given way and allowed to be brought into the mainstream. “We will have to take bitter decisions to strengthen the economy,” he remarked.
Senator Mushtaq Ahmed, while speaking on his motion, said that the SOEs running in losses were a threat to sovereignty of the country. He mentioned that the World Bank, in a report, termed Pakistan’s economic model as failed and ineffective.
“This model is part of the problem and not part of the solution,” he remarked. He added that, according to a World Bank report, tax evasion, concessions and subsidies to the elite class cost $70.4bn.
Senator Kamil Ali Agha of PML-Q suggested a discussion on the performance of each and every SOE one by one to chalk out a future course of action.
Senator Humayun Mohmand of PTI said that, besides corrupt bureaucrats, decision-makers from the political leadership backing them should also be held accountable.
Senator Danesh Kumar said the amount that was being wasted on SOEs every year was equivalent to three years’ budget of Balochistan. He advocated for closing down these burdening SOEs.
Meanwhile, the Senate passed seven bills, including the Christian Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2023, moved by PML-N Senator Kamran Michael, with an adopted amendment proposed by the mover.

1,US airman dies after setting himself on fire outside Israeli embassy,WASHINGTON: A US airman has died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington at the...,"WASHINGTON: A US airman has died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington at the weekend in protest over the war in Gaza, the Air Force said Monday.
The shocking act was an escalation of recent protests across the United States against Israel’s actions in Gaza, where with US support it is waging a retaliatory war for an attack on October 7 by Hamas militants.
Emergency responders on Sunday had rushed to the scene in response to a “call for person on fire outside the Israeli Embassy”, the capital city’s fire department said.
The unnamed man had filmed himself shouting “Free Palestine” as he lit himself on fire, according to footage shared on social media.
He was transported to hospital with “critical life-threatening injuries,” the fire department added, while an Air Force spokeswoman said on Monday morning he had died on Sunday night.
A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy said no staff were injured.
In the video, the man wearing military fatigues and declaring he will “not be complicit in genocide” before dousing himself in liquid, lighting himself on fire and yelling “Free Palestine!” until he collapses.
The video was reportedly first shared in a livestream on the social platform Twitch.
With the death toll in Gaza nearing 30,000, according to the health ministry there, international pressure has been increasing on the United States to rein in ally Israel and call for a ceasefire.
Some voters in Democratic Party are attempting to press the president on the issue, with groups of Arab American voters in Michigan pledging to vote “uncommitted” or write in “Free Palestine” on their ballots in the state’s primary on Tuesday.

2,Bhutto case: CJP finds Justice Mushtaq’s conduct improper,"Amicus curiae refers to Justice Nasim Hasan’s book, interview to make ground for setting aside LHC verdict.","ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, hearing a presidential reference seeking the court’s opinion on revisiting the death penalty awarded to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, has wondered how a high court judge can dictate a Supreme Court judge to be part of a bench to decide appeal against his verdict.
Heading a nine-judge SC bench that had taken up the reference, CJP Isa described as “inappropriate” the conduct of then Lahore High Court chief justice Mushtaq Hussain to approach and ask the then Justice Dr Nasim Hasan Shah to sit in the SC bench hearing the challenge to his order of awarding death to ex-PM and PPP founder Bhutto in 1979.
The fact was more damaging than sitting as an ad hoc judge on the bench, the chief justice observed. “I find this amazing,” he remarked.
 
 

The observation came when one of the amici curiae, Salahuddin Ahmed, cited Memoirs and Reflection — a book by Justice Dr Nasim Hasan Shah — to highlight how the then LHC CJ Mushtaq Hussain along with then Attorney General for Pakistan Sharifuddin Pirzada came to see the author and asked him to sit in SC bench against his judgement of death sentence.

Amicus curiae refers to Justice Nasim Hasan’s book, interview to make ground for setting aside LHC verdict

The nine-judge bench had recently taken up the reference filed in April 2011 on behalf of ex-president Asif Ali Zardari, to seek an opinion on revisiting the death sentence in Bhutto case under the Supreme Court’s advisory jurisdiction.
In March 1979, nearly two years after the Bhutto government’s ouster by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq, a seven-judge SC bench in a split verdict by four to three upheld the LHC verdict of death sentence to ex-PM Bhutto.
The amicus curiae reminded CJP Isa-led bench that even if Justice Mushtaq had visited Dr Shah with a request not to be part of the SC bench hearing Bhutto’s appeal, it was his judicial duty to disclose the same to all other judges of the seven-member bench as well as the defence counsel particularly when Dr Shah was hearing application on the ‘bias’ of Justice Mushtaq and when 90 paragraphs were devoted to the ‘bias’ in the judgement that rejected the application against bias.
This alone could be an independent ground for setting aside the LHC verdict, the lawyer argued.
‘Hearsay?’
At this, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood wondered should we not call this confession as hearsay evidence unless Justice Mushtaq also confirmed the allegations. The counsel, however, said it was not hearsay.
Justice Musarrat Hilali wondered whether this meeting was meant to convey the message of someone else. Why an SC judge would explain his position to the chief justice of a province, she noted. “This means he had conveyed message of someone else,” Justice Hilali remarked.
This could be a reasonable conclusion, the amicus curiae said, adding he only intended to highlight the personal interest of Justice Mushtaq on the matter.
Another aspect from the memoirs was the negotiations conducted by him to reduce the sentence from death to life term, he reminded, adding Dr Shah had admitted in his book he and then CJP Anwarul Haq made personal efforts in this regard.
Now the SC, in the case at hand, has to apply a legal test by considering what conclusion a reasonable observer would draw as to the safety of the judicial proceedings after these revelations, he said.
The verdict should always be unanimous in case of awarding death sentence and the only permissible part of negotiation between judges should be about details of the case since the political impact of the case was “not a judicial rather extraneous consideration”, he said.
The counsel then referred to interview of Dr Shah with journalist Iftikhar Ahmed during which the former conceded that Justice Mushtaq harboured animosity against Bhutto, therefore it was better if he had not sat on the LHC bench in the first place.

3,2m animals die as extreme cold hits Mongolia,The extreme weather is known as “dzud” and typically results in the deaths of huge numbers of livestock.,"BAYANMUNKH SUM: More than two million animals have died in Mongolia so far this winter, a government official said on Monday, as the country endures extreme cold and snow.
The landlocked country is no stranger to severe weather from December to March, when temperatures plummet as low as minus 50 degrees Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit) in some areas.
But this winter has been more severe than usual, with lower than normal temperatures and very heavy snowfall, the United Nations said in a recent report.
As of Monday, 2.1 million head of livestock had died from starvation and exhaustion, Gantulga Bat­sa­ikhan of the country’s agriculture ministry said. Mongolia had 64.7m such animals, including sheep, goats, horses and cows, at the end of 2023, official statistics show.
The extreme weather is known as “dzud” and typically results in the deaths of huge numbers of livestock. The United Nations said climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of dzuds.
Mongolia has experienced six dzuds in the past decade, including the winter of 2022-23 when 4.4m head of livestock perished. This year’s dzud has been exacerbated by a summer drought that prevented animals from building up enough fatty stores to survive the harsh winter.
“The winter started with heavy snow but suddenly air temperatures rose, and the snow melted,” herder Bya­m­baa said. “Then the temperatures dropped again, tur­ning the melting snow into ice.”

4,Another PIA cabin crew member ‘goes missing from Toronto’,"When the authorities opened Maryam's hotel room, they found her uniform with a note reading ""Thank you, PIA"".","RAWALPINDI: Another member of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) cabin crew has reportedly gone missing while on duty, after landing in Canada.
Maryam Raza arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad on Monday, but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.
When the authorities opened her hotel room, they found her uniform with a note reading ‘Thank you, PIA’.
Ms Raza joined the national flag carrier 15 years ago and was assigned to the flight from Islamabad to Toronto.
This is the second such case this year of a PIA stewardess “vanishing” after landing in Canada, according to the airline’s spokesman.
 
 

Officials say this trend is due to the flexible Canadian law, which offers asylum after entering the country.
Last month, a similar incident was reported when an air hostess failed to report for the return flight after arriving in Canada.
Last year, at least seven PIA cabin crew members went missing in Canada while performing flight duties.
According to the national carrier’s spokesman, one of the crew members who had slipped away while on duty some years ago has now settled in Canada and “advises” other crew members mulling asylum.
He added that the PIA management has been coordinating with Canadian authorities to stop such incidents in future.

5,"Declare Israel’s occupation illegal, Arab states urge ICJ","Ankara describes Tel Aviv’s act as ""real obstacle to peace"".","THE HAGUE: Arab states urged international judges on Monday to rule the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories illegal and Turkiye described the occupation as “the real obstacle to peace” on the final day of hearings in a case examining its legal status.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been hearing arguments from more than 50 states following a request by the UN General Assembly in 2022 to issue a non-binding opinion on the legal consequences of the Israeli occupation.
On the sixth and last day of hearings, Turkiye’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ahmet Yildiz told judges the occupation was the root cause of conflict in the region.
“The unfolding situation after October 7 proves once again that, without addressing the root cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there can be no peace in the region,” he said, describing the occupation of Palestinian territories as “the real obstacle to peace” and urging the judges to declare it illegal.

Ankara describes Tel Aviv’s act as ‘real obstacle to peace’

Israel, which is not taking part in the hearings, has said the court’s involvement could be harmful to achieving a negotiated settlement, calling the questions posed to the court prejudiced.
Palestinian factions have also come under international pressure to end their own divisions over their response to Israel’s occupation, the war in Gaza and what political system might follow it.
Earlier on Monday, the Arab League’s secretary general Ahmed Aboul Gheit described the occupation as “an affront to international justice” in a statement read out by a representative.
The League called upon the ICJ, also known as the World Court, to “confirm the illegality of this occupation and unambiguously rule on the legal consequences for all parties, especially those who turn a blind eye, facilitate, assist, or participate in any way in perpetuating this illegal situation”.
Last week, Palestinian representatives asked the judges to declare Israel’s occupation of their territory illegal and said the court’s opinion could help reach a two-state solution to decades of Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has now devastated Gaza.
Israel defies UN court order
Meanwhile, two human rights groups on Monday accused Israel of further limiting humanitarian aid into Gaza despite an order from the UN’s top court.
The ICJ had one month ago said Israel must do everything to prevent genocidal acts in the besieged territory.
It must also take “immediate and effective measures” for aid provision, the World Court said.
But Israeli authorities have “failed to take even the bare minimum steps to comply” with the ICJ ruling issued on January 26, Amnesty International said.
 






Both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the number of aid trucks entering Gaza had actually decreased by roughly one-third since the ruling, which came in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention.
“The Israeli government is starving” Gaza’s 2.4 million Palestinians, “putting them in even more peril than before the World Court’s binding order,” said Omar Shakir, HRW’s Israel and Palestine director.
The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said there was a “50 per cent reduction” in humanitarian aid entering Gaza during February compared to January. “Aid was supposed to increase not decrease to address the huge needs of two million Palestinians in desperate living conditions,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on X, formerly Twitter.
