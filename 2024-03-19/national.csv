0,SBP maintains key rate at record 22%,Cites caution amid ongoing IMF talks and inflation concerns,"Pakistan’s central bank has left its key policy rate unchanged at a record high of 22% for the fifth consecutive time in the past nine months, taking a cautious approach against a likely uptick in inflation readings, which have started cooling down but remain elevated amid ongoing talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In its latest monetary policy statement (MPS) for the next six weeks, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said that in approaching Monday’s decision, the monetary policy committee (MPC) noted that inflation has begun to decline noticeably from January 2024, in line with earlier expectations.
“The Committee, however, observed that despite the sharp deceleration in February, the level of inflation remains high, and its outlook is susceptible to risks amidst elevated inflation expectations.”
The MPC noted that headline inflation registered a broad-based and considerable year-on-year decline from 28.3% in January to 23.1% in February.
The recent uptrend in international petroleum oil prices poses a threat to increase the country’s imports and add imported inflation to the domestic economy in the wake of the ongoing tense situation in the Red Sea.
More importantly, the government’s assurance to the IMF in the ongoing talks for the next tranche of $1.1 billion and for securing a new – longer and larger programme – that it would further increase electricity prices soon. Besides, fiscal measures that may push prices up pose a risk to the near and medium-term inflation outlook.
“Cognisant of these risks, the Committee assessed that it is prudent to continue with the current monetary policy stance at this stage,” the SBP said in its policy statement.
The SBP noted that while energy inflation also decelerated on a year-on-year basis in February, “the adjustments in administered energy prices have continued to contribute to inflation directly and indirectly. This has implications for the needed sustained decline in inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses.”
However, the “improvement in inflation broadly reflects the combined impact of contractionary monetary policy, fiscal consolidation, better food supplies, moderating global commodity prices, and a favourable base effect.”
Financial experts and key investors had stood sharply divided over whether the central bank would cut the rate or maintain it on Monday, believing inflation has decelerated and made the real interest rate positive on a forward-looking basis and would turn positive on the spot level as well this month (March 2024).
In January, the central bank revised up its projection for average monthly inflation reading to 23-25% for the ongoing fiscal year 2023-24 due to an increase in energy prices by the government compared to the original (July 2023’s) expectations for 20-22% for the year.

It did not repeat its estimate for the full-year FY24 inflation expectation in the latest statement on Monday.
It, however, urged a cautious approach and continuity of the current monetary stance to bring inflation down to the target range of 5–7% by September 2025.
Earlier, the central bank revised up its key policy rate cumulatively by 15 percentage points from September 2021 to June 2023, raising it to a record high of 22%.
Key developments
The central bank’s committee noted a few key developments since its last meeting held in late January 2024 that have implications for the macroeconomic outlook.
First, the latest data continues to depict a moderate pick-up in economic activity, led by a rebound in agriculture output.
Second, the external current account balance is turning out better than anticipated and has helped maintain foreign exchange (FX) buffers despite weak financial inflows.
Third, while inflation expectations of businesses have shown a steady increase since December, those for consumers have also inched up in March.
Lastly, on the global front, while the broader trend in commodity prices remains benign, oil prices have increased; partly reflecting the continued tense situation in the Red Sea. Moreover, amidst uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook, key central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have continued to maintain a cautious monetary policy stance in recent meetings, SBP said.
Economic outlook stays stable
The central bank reiterated that incoming data supports the MPC’s earlier expectation of a moderate recovery in economic activity in FY24, with real GDP growth expected to remain in the range of 2–3% compared to a contraction of 0.3% in the previous fiscal year.
The agriculture sector remains the key driver. After a strong performance of Kharif crops (especially cotton and rice), prospects for the wheat crop also look promising due to an increase in area under cultivation, better input conditions, and higher output prices.
“Denser vegetation of the wheat crop, as captured by satellite images, also supports this assessment,” the central bank said.
In the industrial sector, despite a slight decline of 0.5% during July-January, large-scale manufacturing is expected to recover in the coming months due to improved capacity utilisation and employment conditions and a favourable base effect.
Furthermore, the knock-on impact of commodity producing sectors and other leading indicators point towards gradual recovery in the services sector, it said.

1,Adani Group bonds plummet on US probe,The group did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment,"Most dollar bonds of Adani Group companies fell to their lowest level in two months on Monday following a report indicating that US prosecutors have widened their investigation of the conglomerate to examine potential bribery.
Shares of all 10 groups and related companies also fell over 5% in early trading in India, with Adani Total Gas leading the decline.
Bond prices fell, resulting in a 38 basis points (bps) increase in the yield on a note from Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone due in February 2032 to 7.20%. The yield had jumped 54 bps to 7.36% earlier in the day, marking the biggest single-session gain since February.
The daily decline on most actively traded dollar bonds was the largest in six to 12 months.
US investigators are probing whether an Adani entity, or individuals associated with the company, including Gautam Adani, were involved in paying officials in India for favourable treatment on an energy project, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The group did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

2,Apparel industry denounces banks,Complains banks ignoring SBP’s orders for utilising retained funds,"Garments’ manufacturers have appreciated the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for its directives regarding “Utilisation of funds held in exporters’ Special Foreign Currency Accounts” (ESFCAs) issued on February 23, 2024, but expressed concern over the lack of implementation by commercial banks, though a few weeks have passed.
In a statement on Monday, Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) Central Chairman Mubashar Naseer Butt said that the SBP, through its circular, had invited the attention of commercial banks towards paragraph 40 of Chapter 12 (Exports) of the Foreign Exchange Manual, which defined purposes for the utilisation of retained funds in ESFCAs.
He observed that the central bank further liberalised the utilisation of retained funds to facilitate exporters and promote ease of doing business, declaring all exporters would be able to freely utilise the funds held in ESFCAs. These will be used for making all types of payments abroad of the current account nature, for their own business purposes, without prior SBP approval.
Furthermore, on the request of exporters, authorised dealers may issue debit cards against balances held in ESFCAs. Butt called it highly disturbing that a step taken for the facilitation of exporters had been totally ignored by banks, which showed no practical will to comply with the directive.
It “is also reflective of the weak administrative control of the central bank over the banking industry.”
The association chief said that the apparel sector had the status of Pakistan’s top national industry, which was providing jobs to millions of workers directly and indirectly, and earning billions of dollars in foreign exchange for the national exchequer.
“The apparel industry has shown great export potential and it is one of the main contributors to LSM growth.”

3,"With fresh gains, rupee at 5-1/2-month high",The currency got support from the ongoing smooth talks with the IMF for the release of last tranche of $1.1 billion,"Pakistani currency on Monday hit almost five-and-a-half-month high at Rs278.63 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market, maintaining its uptrend for the fourth consecutive working day amid talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of last loan tranche and for a new programme.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee appreciated 0.03%, or Rs0.11, against the greenback on a day-on-day basis compared to Friday’s close at Rs278.74/$.
The local currency has cumulatively strengthened 10.21%, or Rs28.47, in the past over six months compared to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ touched in the first week of September 2023.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the rupee remained stable at Rs281.20/$ in the open market for the second successive working day.

The currency got support from the ongoing smooth talks with the IMF for the release of last tranche of $1.1 billion under the $3 billion standby arrangement ending in March-April 2024.
The five-day talks were scheduled to end on Monday with an expected staff-level agreement, which means that the IMF mission is convinced that Pakistan has met almost all the targets set for the last tranche.
On the other hand, the government has decided to formally approach the IMF for a longer and larger loan programme of $8 billion in mid-April 2024 when the global lender will hold its annual meetings. Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is set to attend the meetings along with his economic team.
Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, held by the SBP, rose by $17 million to $7.9 billion, according to the central bank’s weekly update. The increase in forex reserves indicates that the supply of foreign currency is higher than its demand in the banking system. Exporters are consistently selling increased dollar proceeds on futures’ counters.

4,Experts push for corporate farming,"Advocate strategic shifts to boost crop yields, subsidies to farmers","Industrialists and progressive growers have described corporate farming as a positive initiative aimed at revamping and promoting the agriculture sector of the country. They advocate for establishing market prices for seeds, urea, pesticides, and agricultural commodities, alongside providing subsidies to farmers.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, they highlighted the adverse impact of rising production costs and fluctuating crop prices on farmers’ livelihoods and the government’s reputation, emphasising the need for immediate attention to mitigate these challenges. They stressed the necessity for a green revolution to drive agricultural development in Pakistan, advocating for strategic crop selection based on land suitability.
With the ongoing decline in international wheat prices, they urged a shift towards cultivating commodities that Pakistan typically imports, such as palm oil, while also recommending a halt to sugarcane cultivation due to its high water consumption. Redirecting resources towards cultivating other valuable food crops, including cotton, was proposed as a proactive measure.
They advocated for policies, including the agriculture development policy, to be crafted and executed at the state level, highlighting their stability and credibility even among international organisations. By decentralising policymaking, continuity can be ensured, independent of changes in government leadership within the country.

Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI) President Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani lauded the federal government’s initiative in crafting a corporate farming policy aimed at advancing Pakistan’s agriculture sector, deeming it commendable. He called for formulating national seed and agriculture development policies to facilitate corporate farming in the country. Highlighting the landscape of land ownership in Pakistan, Shaikhani said without robust data collection, the policy may inadvertently favour large landowners, thereby neglecting smaller cultivators and perpetuating disparities. He said Pakistan’s significant agricultural potential, with 40% of its land being flat and cultivable, could effectively address the nation’s food crisis. He advocated for the adoption of international farming technologies, including researched seeds, high-quality pesticides, urea, and modern machinery, to substantially increase crop yields.
Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) President Adeel Siddiqui said it bodes well to make wasteland cultivable and productive through corporate farming. Instead of inviting foreign investors, local investors should be invited first to take land and make investments.
There is a complex situation regarding this newly crafted corporate policy, and the government must provide a clear-cut policy and guidelines about it, as local industrialists-cum-investors are concerned about the availability of water to irrigate agricultural lands, he said. If the government and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) successfully dispel water concerns of potential local investors, it would be a far more successful story, as the agriculture-based economy can win more laurels in the near future.
“Approximately 82% of landholding in Sindh pertains to a maximum of 16 acres of agricultural lands, which means mostly landlords in the province own lands varying from five acres to 16 acres. Another 18% of landholding is owned by big landlords who have lands from 20 acres to 200 acres and above. Corporate farming is suitable for state lands that spread over thousands of acres. Cooperative farming suits the private sector, as there are lands in pockets from five to 16 acres,” Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) Senior Vice President Nabi Bux Sathio said.
He added that three provincial public entities, including Sindh agriculture and livestock departments, and Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), possess around 50,000 acres of agricultural lands, stating that it would be useful to utilise agricultural lands of the public departments for corporate farming. If these lands are deployed or used, it could definitely meet quality, cheap, and appropriate seed requirements of the entire province, while strengthening the food security of Sindh.

5,Textile exports dip again despite yearly growth,Exports drop 3.31% in February 2024 in absence of value-addition,"After experiencing slight increases in export figures for two consecutive months, Pakistan’s textile exports have once again entered negative territory on a month-on-month basis.
According to the latest figures released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Monday, textile group exports for February 2024 declined by 3.31% compared to January 2024, with February figures totalling $1.41 billion against January’s $1.46 billion.
On a yearly basis, textile product exports managed to remain in positive territory, showing an increase of 19.20%. Export figures for February 2023 were recorded at $1.18 billion.
The textile sector is a cornerstone of Pakistan’s economy, with stakeholders claiming it contributes around 60% overall. However, despite this significant role, it is not performing as expected, and the situation is deteriorating.
After nearly a year of negative export figures, the sector entered positive territory in December 2023. However, it only remained positive for two consecutive months before returning to negative territory.
Breakdown of the data shows that raw cotton exports remained flat in February 2024 at zero billion dollars, marking a 100% decline on a month-on-month basis.
Cotton yarn exports for February 2024 amounted to $78,428 million, a decline of 3.46% from January’s $81,295 million. However, on a yearly basis, they increased by 41.16%, with February 2023 figures at $55,597 million.

Cotton cloth exports saw an increase of 8.63% in February 2024 ($173,501 million) compared to January 2024 ($159,719 million), and a yearly growth of 12.13%.
The knitwear sector also remained in negative territory, with February 2024 figures at $335,964 million against January 2024’s $365,050 million, a decline of 7.97%. However, on a yearly basis, it showed an increase of 21.24%.
Bedwear sector exports also declined by 3.27% month-on-month, with February 2024 figures at $243,823 million compared to January 2024’s $252,076 million. However, they increased by 24.53% year-on-year, with February 2023 figures at $195,800 million.
On a month-on-month basis, the readymade garments sector declined by 7.92%, with February 2024 figures at $307.000 million compared to January 2024’s $333.411 million. However, it also managed to post a yearly increase of 20.32%.
The breakdown of textile group data further suggests that nearly all value addition sectors remain in the negative zone. There may be many reasons behind this, one being the traditional excuse of higher energy costs from stakeholders, which makes Pakistani products uncompetitive.
Another reason is the lack of innovation or value addition in textile products. The majority of Pakistani textile entrepreneurs continue to sell the same old-fashioned products in global markets. These old products are price-competitive, with little margins. Many economists believe that if Pakistan does not find new markets with a focus on value addition as per global demand, it will be very tough for this sector to increase its share in the overall country’s export figures.

6,Over Rs4/unit power tariff hike sought,Requested increase of Rs4.9917/unit includes previous adjustments of Rs0.5484/unit,"Consumers should brace themselves for another jolt in their electricity bills, as the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) has requested a tariff increase of Rs4.9917 per unit due to fuel charges adjustment (FCA) for February 2024.
Following a rise of over Rs7 per unit in January due to fuel adjustments, CPPA, representing Ex-Wapda Discos (XWDiscos), submitted a petition to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). It cited that the reference fuel charge for February was Rs4.4337 per unit, while the actual cost of energy delivered to Discos was Rs9.4254 per unit. The requested increase of Rs4.9917 per unit includes previous adjustments of Rs0.5484 per unit. If fully approved by NEPRA, this could burden electricity consumers with an additional Rs40 billion (FCA + General Sales Tax). NEPRA will hold a public hearing on March 28, 2024, to review the petition.
The breakdown of data reveals varying costs across different generation sources, from Rs1.3213 per unit for nuclear to Rs27.1968 per unit for electricity imported from Iran. No electricity was generated from High Speed Diesel and Furnace Oil during the month.
CPPA’s application states that total electricity generated from various fuels in the month of February was 7,130 GWh (giga watt per hour), costing Rs8.6950 per unit, with a total energy cost of Rs61,996 million. Of this, 6,876 GWh costing Rs64,804 million was delivered to Discos, with 3.53% transmission losses.

Power generation sources in February included 1766 GWh from hydel sources constituting 24.77% with zero cost of power generation, 1129 GWh from coal-fired plants (13.94% local coal at Rs14.1863 per unit and 1.89% imported coal at Rs20.2194 per unit), 787 GWh or 11.04% from local gas at the cost of Rs12.3794 per unit, 1450 GWh or 20.33% from RLNG at the cost of Rs24.2952 per unit, and 1,660 GWh or 23.29% from nuclear plants costing Rs1.3213 per unit. Imported Iranian energy cost Rs27.1968 per unit in February. Bagasse contributed 1.41% to the national grid at Rs5.9822 per unit, while wind and solar contributed 1.53% and 1.26%, respectively, to the total generation in February 2024.
Last week, Pakistan assured the International Monetary Fund of a timely increase in electricity prices, including the recovery of pending generation costs totalling over Rs210 billion.
After the Rs7.05 per unit increase in the fuel adjustment price of electricity in February 2024 for the month of January 2024, different business groups expressed grave concern and called the hike unexpected. They added that this increase would put a burden of Rs70 billion on the people of Pakistan, adding that apart from domestic consumers, the industrial sector, especially the export-oriented sector, will suffer a huge loss in terms of foreign exchange.

7,Pasha urges action on economic challenges,"Discusses ways with LCCI president to boost country’s exports, tax revenue","Addressing the Conference on Medium-Term Economic Outlook of Pakistan at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), former Federal Finance Minister Dr Hafeez Pasha highlighted the country’s ability to overcome ongoing economic challenges. He underscored that while Pakistan had endured difficult economic conditions in the past, it had managed to navigate through them.
Pasha noted that Pakistan’s average GDP growth over the last four years stood at 2.5%, mirroring the population growth rate. This stagnant income growth highlighted the need for economic reforms. He cited factors such as the impact of COVID-19 and natural disasters like floods as hurdles faced by the economy.

Highlighting concerning statistics, Pasha pointed out that over the last 15 years, exports had only increased by 2% annually, while imports surged by 8% to 9% annually. This trend led to a widening current account deficit, which stood at $19 billion in 2017-18, with external debt surpassing $130 billion. Additionally, unemployment had risen to 10.5%, with poverty rates escalating from 33% to 45%.
LCCI President Kashif Anwar echoed these concerns, particularly underscoring the adverse effects of rupee devaluation on inflation and external debt. He stressed the urgency of addressing issues within state-owned enterprises, advocating for privatisation or restructuring. Responding to these challenges, the former finance minister proposed several solutions. He highlighted the importance of boosting exports and tax revenue, suggesting the reintroduction of schemes like the bonus voucher scheme from the 1960s to incentivise exports. Drawing inspiration from Bangladesh’s model, he proposed diversifying the tax base to include sectors like agriculture and real estate.

8,"PSX bounces back on SBP, IMF optimism","KSE-100 index rises 74.04 points, settles at 64,890.51","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday experienced a modest recovery, fueled by anticipation surrounding the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) monetary policy announcement and optimism about the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) final review under its standby arrangement (SBA).
In the morning, trading began on a positive note but the KSE-100 index soon plunged to the intra-day low at 64,811.92 points. Thereafter, it recovered rapidly and after frequent ups and down, the index reached the intra-day high at 65,148.36 points.
At that point, investors got an opportunity to opt for profit-taking over caution ahead of the monetary policy announcement scheduled for around 4pm. Resultantly, the bourse fell close to its intra-day low post-midday trading, slipping below the 65,000 mark.
Nevertheless, the market rebounded, propelled by surging global crude oil prices and strengthening of the Pakistani rupee, driven by optimism surrounding the IMF’s review for the release of $1.2 billion loan tranche. Fertiliser, banking and power sectors mainly contributed positively to the index.
Despite closing below 65,000, the market managed to recover all the earlier losses, ending the day positively. “Stocks showed recovery on speculation ahead of SBP’s announcement later today (Monday) and hopes for a productive final IMF review for the release of SBA tranche,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
Read: PSX under pressure over IMF talk concerns
“Surging global crude oil prices and stronger rupee played the role of catalysts in positive close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 74.04 points, or 0.11%, and settled at 64,890.51. Topline Securities Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib, in his report, said “Pakistan equities kicked off the week on a positive note as the KSE-100 index touched intra-day high at 65,148 (+332 points; or 0.51%) in the morning. However, at the day’s high, profit-taking kicked in.”
“This market behaviour can be attributed to a cautious approach adopted by investors ahead of monetary policy announcement (scheduled at around 4pm),” he said. A majority at the street expected the central bank to maintain the status quo. However, a surprise reduction in rate would be taken positively by the PSX, Najib added.
Fertiliser, banking and power sectors contributed positively to the index as Fauji Fertiliser, Meezan Bank, Hub Power, United Bank and Dawood Hercules cumulatively added 141 points.
On the flip side, Lucky Cement, Systems Limited and MCB Bank saw some profit-taking as they lost 72 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, commented that there was “a dull start to the week ahead of the SBP rate decision where views were mixed regarding the start of an easing cycle now or later in the year.”
Top index contributors were Fauji Fertiliser (+2.03%), Meezan Bank (+1.8%) and Hub Power (+0.98%), it said, adding that Pakistan Telecommunication Company (+7.58%) was the standout performer, which kept the tech sector in the limelight and had gained 29.47% month to date. JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the PSX saw range-bound activity with the KSE-100 index closing at 64,890 with gains of 74 points.
“Going forward, we recommend investors to consider any downside as an opportunity to buy stocks in banking, and exploration and production (E&P) sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 211.8 million shares against Friday’s tally of 259.4 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs7.8 billion.
Shares of 328 companies were traded. Of these, 145 stocks closed higher, 158 dropped and 25 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 16.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.36. It was followed by Hascol Petroleum with 16.3 million shares, losing Rs0.28 to close at Rs8.28 and Telecard Limited with 14.7 million shares, gaining Rs0.33 to close at Rs9. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs110.7 million, according to the NCCPL.

9,Company may sink if tariff hike delayed: SSGC,Seeks price increase of Rs274.40 per mmBtu effective from July 1,"The management of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has warned that the public gas utility will sink financially if gas prices are not increased at an appropriate time.
At a public hearing held by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Monday, SSGC sought a price increase of Rs274.40 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) effective from July 1, 2024 to meet its revenue requirement of Rs359 billion.
The company asked for Rs25 billion on account of return on assets. SSGC managing director said that it was a difficult situation for the company as it was paying for gas purchase in dollars and selling it to consumers in rupees.
Owing to that situation, the company’s huge receivables amounting to Rs300 billion had got stuck over the past two years.
Payables of the company stood at more than Rs300 billion, SSGC officials said, adding that the outstanding dues were also impacting hydrocarbon search activities of oil and gas exploration companies.
Chief financial officer of SSGC pointed out that delay in notifying gas prices was also causing cash flow trouble for the company.
He added that the government had notified gas prices in November last year whereas “it is bound to notify tariffs in January and July”. He also asked the government to include the revenue shortfall in Balochistan while revising gas prices.
A representative of Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) said that gas reserves had plunged by 23% in the past four years, which forced Pakistan to start relying on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.
While the regulator had been able to partially apply the weighted average cost of gas, he called on the authority to completely implement the formula, which would largely help to recover the cost of imported gas. It would also “ensure better cash flow for the companies”.

He argued that the full impact of losses should be passed on to consumers in the case of both locally produced gas and the imported LNG.
Another industry representative opposed the proposed hike in gas prices, saying it had become very difficult for the industry to survive in the face of sharply higher gas tariffs.
In a written response, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) Southern Region advocated the need for market deregulation and shifting from the guaranteed rates of return model to competitive pricing in the gas market.
It emphasised that liberalisation of the gas market would foster competition and innovation, allow new players to enter the arena and promote efficiency.
Textile millers underscored the necessity of linking asset expansion and investment decisions to economic viability and market dynamics.
Gas prices have been hiked to Rs2,750 per mmBtu, an increase of 223% since January 2023. Similarly, grid electricity tariffs stand at approximately 17.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and are still increasing with no end in sight.
As such, there is no financially viable source of energy for firms to manufacture goods and be able to compete effectively in international markets.
“Tariffs are the highest in the region,” the textile millers said in their response, adding that high energy costs posed a threat to national security by hindering industrial growth, denting competitiveness and increasing imports and dependence on debt.
There was a 12% decline in SGGC’s system intake, but the heavily cross-subsidised residential consumer demand was increasing. The millers called for revising the protected consumer policy to ensure that it was targeted and sustainable, shielded gas utility’s revenue and eliminated price distortion.
They emphasised that natural gas pricing was not based on economic principles that led to distortions, inflated demand, inefficient use and circular debt.
SSGC confronts an unaccounted-for-gas (UFG), a term used for gas theft and leakages, rate of 12% in natural gas supplies and 14.36% in re-gasified LNG, which are significantly higher than global benchmarks and indicative of systemic technical challenges, governance, political, cultural and socioeconomic issues.
