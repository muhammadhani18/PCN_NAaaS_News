0,Funeral cum burial a costly affair now,"Sellers jack up rates of shrouds, camphor, rose water, flowers, grave-digging","While inflation isn’t sparing any item or service nowadays, the shrouds for funeral and burial items have also become much more expensive for the residents of Rawalpindi.
Particularly, poor families are facing many difficulties in burying their loved ones as funeral items especially shrouds have become record expensive in the open market. The complete set of a good cotton shroud is available for Rs3,500, and a poor quality cotton shroud is being sold for Rs3,000.
The sellers are charging Rs550 per kg for flower petals and Rs400 for rose flowers, yellow common flowers, mixed green leaf and mixed flower petals. The price of candles is currently Rs300, a camphor (kafur) box Rs350, and the rose water is Rs250 per bottle.
A grave sheet with artificial flowers is being sold at Rs900, a good quality sheet at Rs1,200, while a fresh flower sheet is being sold at Rs1,800. The graves are dug in Rs10,000 to Rs15,000 in cemeteries, while bricks and compensation of gravediggers have been increased to Rs5,500.
The burial rituals have become a headache for poor families, who are seen borrowing money for the funeral process. The expenses of food and drinks after the burial are added expenses.
Feroze Malik, who sells shrouds, says all types of cloth including white woven cotton have become much more expensive in the last two years or so. “We mix two qualities of fabric in the shroud that is sold at lower rates and provide free of cost shroud to the deserving after verifications,” he added.
According to Feroze, they are running a non-government organisation (NGO) with the help of donations to provide free shrouds.
He further said fully prepared shroud sets were provided within 24 hours of the burials.

1,Prices of iftar items double this Ramazan,"Big eateries charge iftar dinner from Rs1,800 to Rs3,000 per person","With the opening of large iftar centres and iftar buffets all over the city to facilitate thousands of citizens, the prices of iftar items have almost touched the sky this year. Refreshment centres are too no exception.
With the onset of Ramazan, thousands of temporary stalls and pushcarts have been set up in all streets and neighbourhoods across the city for selling pakora, samosa, kachori, chips, chana chaat, dahi baray, fruit chaat and dates.
Where the prices of all iftar items have been increased by 100%, the use of low-grade oil and raw materials in making pakora and samosa has caused diseases among the buyers.
Famous iftar item pakora is being sold at Rs1,200 per kg, potato samosa Rs720 per dozen, chicken samosa Rs900 per dozen, kachori plain vegetable mix Rs200 per piece, kachori chicken with minced meat Rs250 per piece, chana chaat Rs350 per plate, dahi baray large Rs250 to Rs270 per plate, fruit chaat Rs300 to Rs350 per plate, French fries Rs100 per box, small samosa Rs250 dozen, potato roll Rs30, potato cake Rs30 to Rs35 and dates are being sold at Rs800 to Rs1,000 per kg.
In big hotels and restaurants, iftar dinner is being charged from Rs1,800 to Rs3,000 per person. As the demand for pakora, samosa, samosa roll, French fires and kachori peaks during the holy month, the sale of adulterated oil and ghee also jumps in the market. The street vendors are seen using cheap substandard oil and ghee in making iftar items at the cost of human health.
The chairman of the Citizen Action Committee, Zaheer Awan has demanded action against the sale of adulterated ghee and oil in the city markets.
Additional Medical Superintendent at Benazir Bhutto Hospital Dr Anayat says that adulterated ghee and oil, which is produced with the help of fats, trigger intestinal diseases and cancer.
He says the Punjab Food Authority (PFA) needs to take strict measures against the production and sale of such oil and ghee. Dr Anayat has advised people with fasting to remain cautious while buying samosa and pakora from street vendors.

2,SPARC suggests more tax on cigarette,Urges new finance minister to consider tobacco taxation as a potential avenue for boosting the economy,"The Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC) warmly welcomed the appointment of the new finance minister and urged him to consider tobacco taxation as a potential avenue for boosting the economy.
Aligning with public health initiatives, the SPARC emphasised the importance of increasing taxes on cigarettes to reduce tobacco consumption, thus promoting better health outcomes for the population, according to a press release.
The SPARC shared the concerns of health activists who advocate for higher taxes on cigarettes rather than utilities. This strategic approach not only aligns with public health goals but also addresses the broader economic implications associated with tobacco use.
Malik Imran Ahmad, country head for Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK), appealed to the newly appointed Finance Minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, to recognise the significant challenge posed by tobacco consumption in Pakistan. With approximately 31.9 million adults consuming tobacco, accounting for 19.7% of the adult population, the impact on public health and the economy cannot be overstated.
Ahmad emphasised the burden placed on healthcare resources to treat smoking-induced non-communicable diseases, underscoring the urgent need for measures such as increased tobacco taxation to mitigate the economic strain and protect public health.
Dr Khalil Ahmad, Programme Manager at SPARC, highlighted the affordability of cigarettes as a driving factor behind youth initiation into smoking, further emphasising the economic costs associated with smoking-related illnesses and deaths.
With such a significant portion of Pakistan’s GDP being expended on addressing tobacco-related issues, effective tobacco control measures are imperative to alleviate the economic burden and safeguard public health, he said.

3,Encroachments clog Rawalpindi streets,"Main markets are overwhelmed with traffic, exacerbating the situation in Ramazan","As the operations against the encroachment mafia in Rawalpindi effectively came to a halt during the holy month of Ramazan, the entire city succumbed to the grip of the encroachment mafia.
Ever-increasing encroachment in different areas, especially the cantonment, of the city remains one of the core civic problems being faced by the residents who have shown their concerns over the poor response by the authorities concerned.
Main thoroughfares, footpaths, and residential areas were not spared from encroachment. Consequently, traffic congestion has become a common sight on crucial roads like Murree Road.
Despite written appeals to the tehsil administration by traffic authorities, efforts to engage anti-encroachment personnel proved futile. Demands arose from citizens urging the Punjab chief minister to eradicate the encroachment mafia from the city.
Cantonment areas including Octri 22, Tench Bhatta, People’s Colony, Kalma Chowk and adjacent areas are facing consistent mess, particularly in the evenings when a considerable number of vehicles enter these areas.
Tahir Taj Bhatti, a trader in Moti Bazaar, emphasised that encroachment lies at the heart of Rawalpindi’s myriad issues. From major commercial hubs to everyday streets, encroachments abound, rendering pedestrian movement near impossible.
The pervasive encroachment around Moti Bazaar deters buyers, as the area remains congested throughout the day. Iconic areas such as Fawara Chowk, Kashmiri Bazaar, Ganj Mandi, Dal Gran Bazar, Old Qala, and Urdu Bazar have become inaccessible. Despite erecting towering structures to boost commerce and faithfully paying all government dues, these buildings find their entry and exit routes encroached upon.
Businessman Yasir Butt highlighted the mafia’s stronghold over major commercial centres like Bara Market, Commercial Market, Murree Road, Syedpur Road, Circular Road, Bani Bazaar, Murghi Mandi, and Bagh Sardaran. Even prominent businessmen are unable to dislodge them. Traders, having invested millions, find themselves waiting in vain for customers, primarily due to encroachment and round-the-clock traffic congestion plaguing Raja Bazaar and its adjacent markets.
“Shopkeepers extend their stalls on main roads, which create hurdles even for pedestrians,” said Amir, a resident of Tench Bhatta. He said that hawkers continuously move on roads, creating hurdles in the smooth running of vehicles. 
Despite occasional area visits by the encroachment teams of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB), the situation remains unchanged, Amir said and recommended a licencing system for vegetable/fruit hawkers for selling their items on roads.
“The visits of the RCB team before the opening of businesses even make no difference,” he said and suggested the team should hold surprise visits during working hours.
The same situation also prevails on Mughalabad-Abid Majid Road and Peoples Colony localities. “Tench Bhatta is not only densely populated but also as a whole locality it serves as a corridor between Sadar, Dhoke Syedan and Dhamial areas,” said another resident Raja Babar.
He said that a systematic market management plan is required to overcome the problem of encroachments. “The encroachments have also badly affected human behaviour and are accelerating psychological aggression among the locals,” Babar maintained.
Addressing the escalating issues of encroachment and traffic congestion, traffic police officials clarified that removing encroachments falls outside the purview of traffic duties. Nonetheless, traffic wardens persist in their efforts, aided by lifters, to ensure smooth traffic flow. However, the encroachment mafia has entrenched itself deeply within the city.
Encroachments are temporarily removed only to resurface once authorities withdraw. Officials noted that footpaths along Murree Road have been cleared, yet shopkeepers have unlawfully seized these spaces.
Despite numerous appeals to the commissioner, deputy commissioner, and tehsil municipal officer regarding the encroachment mafia and its associated problems, no department has taken decisive action against them.
Tehsil Municipal Office officials disclosed that actions against the encroachment mafia are sporadically carried out without prior notification. Millions worth of seized equipment from the encroachment mafia have been confiscated and transferred to the tehsil office.
The primary responsibility for establishing encroachments on main highways and footpaths lies with the local business community. If every shopkeeper assumes responsibility and confines their goods to their shops, rather than encroaching on footpaths, no issues would arise.
The anti-encroachment cell also conducts operations during sehri and iftar hours in response to citizen complaints, which will now be intensified.

4,WASA consumers get e-billing facility,Official says system will be operational within next two days,"The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) inked an agreement on Tuesday with the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) to provide an e-billing facility to its customers.
Under the agreement, WASA Rawalpindi customers will be able to deposit water and sewerage bills through all microfinance applications powered by NADRA e-facility, which includes Jazz Cash, Easy Paisa, Mobi Cash, U Paisa etc.
Earlier, water and sewerage bills were being collected, but complaints were received from consumers that they were sent bills despite paying them off. According to a WASA official, the main reason was that there was no direct contract between WASA Rawalpindi and NADRA e-facility and WASA customers had to depend on private franchises that despite receiving money from customers were not depositing the amount into the WASA's account.
He added that now an agreement has been signed between WASA Rawalpindi and NADRA e-facility to address the complaints of the customers. WASA Managing Director, Muhammad Saleem Ashraf and NADRA E-Facility Department Head, Muhammad Irfan Anwar signed the agreement. The system will be operational within the next two days.
WASA’s managing director said that today's agreement was crucial for the convenience of WASA customers and now customers can easily pay their bills from home or through any microfinance bank and the amount will be deposited directly into the WASA's account.

6,PEIRA launches admission drive,"As per official letter, implementation of 10% need-based scholarships, free education mandatory","The Private Education Institutions Regulatory Authority (PEIRA) has launched an admissions drive for mandatory implementation of 10% need-based scholarships, and free education in each school for the year 2024-25 in private educational institutions of the federation.
According to the letter issued the other day, PEIRA appreciated the role of private educational institutions in the Zero-Out-of-School-Children Campaign of the Federal Ministry of Education and Vocational Training to reduce the number of children deprived of access to education. In continuation of this effort, PEIRA requested a formal and systematic initiative to ensure the right of children to free and compulsory education at the government level. The provision of a 10 per cent need-based scholarship has been made mandatory by the authority for enrolment in the school and is also reflected on its registration certificate.
Given the need to highlight the admission drive for needy students during the annual admissions, private educational institutions have been directed to implement this initiative of providing 10% need-based scholarship/free education in their admissions for the academic session. It should be highlighted in policy or activities.
The authority has directed the private schools to display this announcement clearly at the points of admission/admission offices. Moreover, display this announcement on private educational institutions' websites and all social media channels, prospectus and other digital and traditional media outlets including admission forms.
The offer of 10 per cent seats to needy students will be strictly monitored and strict action will be taken against private educational institutions that fail to comply with this directive, the letter stated. Additionally, the private educational institutions offering the highest number of scholarships to needy students will be recognised and appreciated at the government level.

7,PM greenlights cycling track project,Civic agency to lay 374-kilometre track in Islamabad in 18 months,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has greenlit a plan to construct a network of cycling tracks in the federal capital for Rs2.4 billion. 
The 374-km-long cycling tracks would be laid in 18 months as per the initial plan.
Dubbed as a transformative initiative by the Capital Development Authority, the project is anticipated to promote a healthy lifestyle and combat environmental pollution.  
According to sources, a comprehensive plan has been set in motion to construct cycling tracks across various sectors of the city. This ambitious project will be known as the Bicycle Lane Project (BLP).
The inauguration ceremony of the BLP is poised to be held in the next couple of weeks and Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif will attend the event as the chief guest. 
The primary aim of this endeavour is to encourage healthy activities among citizens while addressing environmental concerns. Upon its completion, all petrol-fuelled bikes will be phased out in Islamabad, marking a paradigm shift towards sustainable transportation.
The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has emphasised the importance of creating a healthy environment for residents. To achieve this goal, bicycle lanes will be integrated into the city's infrastructure, particularly along highways and key areas like Khayaban Iqbal, Sector G-6, G-7, G-8, Green Double Lane, Jinnah Avenue, and Red Double Line. These cycling tracks will not only promote eco-friendly commuting but also facilitate metro bus passengers, offering them an alternative mode of travel.
Furthermore, the BLP includes plans for constructing 150 parking stands to accommodate e-bikes, allowing citizens to access affordable bike rental services. This initiative aligns with the phased elimination of petrol-powered bikes, contributing to a cleaner and healthier urban environment. The project encompasses essential features such as lighting and security arrangements to ensure a safe cycling experience for all users. 
The CDA management has reaffirmed to prioritise environmental sustainability and public health in Islamabad. A senior CDA officer highlighted the project's swift implementation, overseen by expert teams from technical, engineering, and planning backgrounds. The project's multifaceted objectives aim to promote healthy lifestyles, provide cost-effective travel options amidst economic challenges, and significantly reduce environmental pollution.
One of the key strategies involves integrating cycling tracks with metro bus routes, offering commuters a seamless transition between modes of transportation. This innovative approach not only promotes cycling but also reduces reliance on petrol-based vehicles, contributing to a greener cityscape. Additionally, plans are underway to gradually phase out motorcycles in designated sectors, further enhancing environmental quality and promoting sustainable urban development.
The BLP stands as a pioneering initiative, signalling a shift towards eco-friendly mobility and a renewed focus on public health and environmental stewardship in Islamabad. With careful planning, strategic implementation, and community engagement, this project is poised to set a benchmark for sustainable urban infrastructure in Pakistan.
