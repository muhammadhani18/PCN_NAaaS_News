0,SC orders re-election for PB-50 Qila Abdullah,Apex court annuls election supervisor’s order of re-polling at six polling stations,"The Supreme Court ordered re-election on Monday on Balochistan's PB-50 Qila Abdullah constituency after mutual consent of all political parties, including the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, and comprising Justice Irfan Saadat and Justice Naeem Akhtar heard the case. 
Awami National Party’s (ANP) Zmarak Khan had been declared victorious from Qila Abdullah PB-50 in the Feb 8 polls which was challenged by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam’s (JUI) Malik Nawaz in the ECP.
Zmarak had secured 44,713 votes whereas Nawaz was able to bag 43,445 votes. Pashtunkhwa Mili Awami Party’s (PkMAP) Mirwaiz Khan Achakzai received 34,604 votes.
During the hearing, the ANP leader’s counsel contended that the turnout at many polling stations of the constituency remained “unnatural”, but no re-election was ordered there.
He said re-election was ordered only at those polling stations where his client was declared victorious.
He told the court that Zmarak had also taken the oath but it was suspended by the ECP.
The chief justice remarked that the court should not be drawn into such subtleties, adding that it could not hear 400 election cases.
He said if the parties concerned agree the court would order re-polling in the entire constituency.
The top judge remarked that the court was hearing the election cases on priority cases. 
The court annulled the election supervisor’s earlier order of repolling at six polling stations and ordered it to conduct fresh elections in the constituency as per the law.
The re-election order was issued with the mutual consent of all parties including the ECP.
The apex court declared that the polls supervisory body should conduct elections in the constituency according to the law.
The week following the elections in Balochistan was marred by protests from political and religious parties that took to the streets against alleged election irregularities including rigging, manipulation, and undue delays in the announcement of poll results.
Despite calls for restraint and appeals for dialogue, political and religious groups had persisted in holding rallies and demonstrations, intensifying their demands for electoral transparency and accountability.
The ANP leader’s claim of low turnout could be termed as the outcome of the several acts of terrorism that unfolded in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa when the general elections were just around the corner.

1,University staff rally demands salaries,"JAC holds protest demonstration, demands release of salaries, pension","The University of Balochistan Joint Action Committee (JAC) has organised a protest rally, demanding “immediate resolution” of financial issues faced by the faculty members and staff of the varsity and its research centers.
The gathering was led by Professor Dr Kaleemullah Bardich, Shah Ali Bugti, Nazir Ahmad Lehri, Farid Khan Achakzai, Nimatullah Kakar, Gul Jan Kakar, and others.
""No salaries have been paid to the faculty members and employees,"" Kaleem Bareech, the central leader of the academic staff association said, demanding that the Balochistan government address the financial issues of the university.
Starting from Jamia Balochistan, the protesters passed through various roads and streets of the city, morphing the assembly into a demonstration to express their discontent. The participants of the rally carried placards and banners inscribed with slogans of resolution to the prevailing financial woes.
The procession culminated at a protest camp and meeting at the Press Club. 
""This is alarming. [There are] no salaries for employees and faculty members,"" Nazeer Ahmed Lehri, another leader of the academic staff association said. He lamented that despite repeated appeals, the provincial government had failed to address the varsity’s issues. 
In a joint statement, the JAC expressed concern over the non-payment of salaries and pensions for three months, as well as the failure to disburse the full salary for the month of November 2023 and the promised 35% increment announced in the annual budget. 
They also highlighted the lack of housing facilities for teachers, officers, and employees of the research centres, saying it had resulted in “severe hardship”.
Additionally, the JAC urged political parties, student organisations, legal community, and civil society to participate in the protest demonstration to support their cause.

The minister chaired a review meeting with Sehat Card Plus CEO Dr Riaz Tanoli, DG Health Dr Shaukat Ali, Sehat Card Director Dr Ijaz and State Life Insurance Corporation representative Fiaz Noor, and others in attendance.
After the briefing, the health minister maintained that from the first of Ramazan until March 16, over 8,000 individuals in various hospitals were being treated under the Sehat Card Plus Programme, with expenditures exceeding Rs172 million. He said soon State Life Insurance staff would be available round the clock at the health card counters of the hospitals.
Shah observed that following the reforms in July 2023, expenditures in both public and private hospitals covered by the Sehat card remained proportional.
“The highest expenditures on the Sehat Card have been for heart diseases, amounting to Rs18 billion, followed by Rs4 billion on C-sections, and over Rs3 billion on chemotherapy. Entries show that Peshawar’s MTI tops the list,” he said.
The minister highlighted the ongoing considerations for additional enhancements to the project, aimed at providing free and standardised healthcare access to the people of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa through the Sehat Card.

3,Drug shortage spurs research,Meglumine antimoniate is not produced locally,"Experts in medicine, entomology, dermatology and zoology are raising voices for holding clinical trials to find out alternate treatment for Cutaneous Leishminiasis (CL), an overlooked skin ailment of tropical region emerging as third most important vector borne disease after malaria and dengue. 
The concern by experts has been exhibited in wake of the limited cure options due to complete reliance on Meglumine antimonite, a decades old imported drug used as first line treatment for cutaneous leishminiasis requiring injections for 21 to 30 consecutive days.
Meglumine antimoniate is not produced locally and health authorities completely rely on its procurement through imports by international organisations such as the World Health Organization, making it difficult to properly treat this parasitic disease widening its horizon from endemic to non-endemic regions due to rapid urbanization, climate change and large scale dispersion of population,” they explained. 
In many areas the doses each patient receives are insufficient, because of the drug’s limited availability and lack of suitably trained medical staff.
Recent reports regarding exhaustion of glucantime vials stock in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa gave impetus to experts’ call. “The bulky stock of 180,000 jabs imported by Health Department of K-P through WHO in 2018 after the outbreak of cutaneous leishminiasis in the province, has been finished in December 2023 and we are currently short of medicine to treat the patients,” disclosed Salauddin Marwat, entomologist at Integrated Vector Control Programme K-P.
Due to lack of first line medicine, doctors are opting for alternate treatment procedures including cryotherapy, applying minor volumes of liquid nitrogen at -196C to affected portion of skin once or twice on weekly basis up to six weeks and Thermotherapy, applying heat at the scar.
The Integrated Vector Control Programme has supplied equipment for both the therapies in some leishminiasis hotspot of K-P including Dera Ismail Khan, Mohmand and Karak for treatment. 
While for proper treatment through glucantime injections, patients are visiting centers established by Medicines Sans Frontier (MSF), an international medical humanitarian organization, in Khyber Pakhtukhwa, Salauddin told APP.
“After analyzing data of Public Health Department indicating sharp increase in Leishminaiasis infection in the region and its impact on physical and mental health of patients, its time for DRAP, to take measures for availability of a proper, latest, effective and affordable medicine for its treatment,” suggested Dr Rafiq Hayat Malezai, DHO Mohmand District, a hotspot of Leishmaniasis registering around 5,283 cases in 2023.
