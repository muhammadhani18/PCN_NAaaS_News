1,"Gaza's catastrophic food shortage means mass death is imminent, monitor says","Two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation, IPC","Extreme food shortages in parts of the besieged Gaza have already exceeded famine levels, and mass death is now imminent without an immediate ceasefire and surge of food to areas cut off by fighting, the global hunger monitor said on Monday.
The Integrated Food-Security Phase Classification (IPC), whose assessments are relied on by UN agencies, said 70% of people in parts of northern Gaza were suffering the most severe level of food shortage, more than triple the 20% threshold to be considered famine.
The IPC said it did not have enough data on death rates, but estimated residents would be dying at famine scale imminently, defined as two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.
Gaza's health ministry has said 27 children and three adults have died so far from malnutrition.
""The actions needed to prevent famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza,"" it said.
In all, 1.1 million Gazans, around half the population, were experiencing ""catastrophic"" shortages of food, with around 300,000 in the areas now facing the prospect of famine-scale death rates.
The prospect of a manmade famine in Gaza has brought the strongest criticism of Israel from Western allies since it launched its war against Hamas fighters following their deadly attack on Israeli territory on Oct 7.
""In Gaza we are no longer on the brink of famine. We are in a state of famine... Starvation is used as a weapon of war. Israel is provoking famine,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at a Brussels conference on aid for Gaza.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded that Borrell should ""stop attacking Israel and recognise our right to self-defence against Hamas' fighters"".
Israel allowed ""extensive humanitarian aid into Gaza by land, air, and sea for anyone willing to help"", Katz said on X, and aid was ""violently disturbed"" by Hamas fighters with ""collaboration"" by the UN's aid agency UNRWA.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the IPC report an ""appalling indictment"" and said Israel must allow complete and unfettered access to all parts of Gaza.
Britain's foreign minister David Cameron said he would carefully review the report: ""It's clear the status quo is unsustainable. We need urgent action now to avoid a famine.""
Israel, which initially allowed aid into Gaza through only two checkpoints on the enclave's southern edge, says it is opening more routes by land, as well as allowing sea shipments and air drops. The first boat carrying aid arrived last week.
Aid agencies say they still cannot get enough supplies through or distribute them safely, especially in the north.
Hospital assult
In the ruins of Gaza City, the main settlement in the north of the besieged Gaza strip, Israeli forces launched a major assault on Al Shifa hospital overnight. Once the Gaza's biggest hospital, it is now one of the only medical facilities still even partially functioning in the north of the territory.
Israel said it had killed more than 20 Hamas fighters, including a senior Hamas commander, Fayeq al-Mabhouh, in the hospital. Hamas said he was a Palestinian police official tasked with overseeing the protection of aid deliveries in Gaza.
Negotiations for a ceasefire in the war, now in its sixth month, were due to resume on Monday with an Israeli delegation led by the country's spy chief heading to Qatar. But an Israeli official said nailing down any deal would probably take at least two more weeks, a clear disappointment for Washington which had sought a deal by the start of the Ramadan holy month last week.
President Joe Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a call on Monday that a military operation in Rafah would deepen anarchy in Gaza and they agreed that teams from each side would meet in Washington to discuss it, the White House said.
Netanyahu has pledged to push into Rafah in Gaza's southern tip, where more than half of the territory's 2.3 million residents have been sheltering to escape an Israeli assault farther north.
The leader in the US Senate from Biden's Democratic Party called on Israelis last week to replace Netanyahu, saying he was wrecking Israel's international standing by allowing too much suffering in Gaza.
The war began when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 captives according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's assault has killed more than 31,000 Gazans, according to Palestinian health officials.
Special forces
The Israeli military claimed special forces, supported by infantry and tanks, conducted a ""precise operation"" on the Al Shifa Hospital compound, based on intelligence that the hospital was being used by Hamas leaders.
""We apprehended more than 200 terrorist suspects that are now being questioned,"" claimed a spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. One Israeli soldier was killed in the fighting, he alleged.
Residents described some of the heaviest fighting in northern Gaza for months.
Mohammad Ali, 32, a father of two who lives near the hospital, told Reuters via a chat app that the sound of the assault awoke the neighbourhood at around 1 am.
""Soon tanks started to roll, they came from the western road and headed toward Al Shifa, then sounds of gunfire and explosions increased,"" he said.
The Gaza health ministry said displaced people inside the hospital had been killed in a fire caused by the raid.

Additional Sessions Court II Judge Muhammad Jameel delivered the verdict, also imposing a fine of Rs2 million each on the women facing the death penalty, and a fine of Rs1 million on the minor girl involved in the crime.
Tansir Ali and Advocate Haji Shakil represented the prosecution while Advocate Asad Aziz pursued the case on behalf of the accused.

The convicts, two real sisters and their cousin, were affiliated with another religious seminary and attempted to give a religious motive to the murder.
The incident occurred on March 29, 2022, at Jamia Islamia Falah Al-Banat in the Anjumabad area on Dera Multan Road around 7 am.
Initial investigations revealed that differences had arisen between the deceased and the accused over religious matters. A report quoting Imtiaz Janjua, a spokesperson for the district police, stated that the assailants believed the slain teacher, Safoora Bibi, had committed blasphemy.
According to the FIR, the three girls - Umra Aman, 24, daughter of Deen Badshah; Razia Hanifia, 21, and Aisha Noman, 17, daughters of Allah Noor - allegedly attacked the teacher with a stick at the seminary gate and later stabbed her in the neck.
The accused students had reportedly informed the police that a religious figure had appeared in the dream of a 13-year-old relative, indicating that the teacher had committed blasphemy. A knife and a stick were recovered from the arrested girls, as stated in the FIR.

3,Legal opinion sought on SIC's status,National Assembly speaker seeks AGP whether party can be classified as a parliamentary party,"The National Assembly Secretariat has sought legal opinion from the Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP), Mansoor Awan, asking the state’s top law officer whether the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) can be classified as a parliamentary party.
The little-known SIC became one of the largest parties in parliament when independent lawmakers, backed by the PTI, joined it after the official results of the February 8 general elections were announced.
In its letter to the AGP, the secretariat stated that SIC Chairman Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza requested NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on March 14 to appoint Zain Hussain Qureshi as the SIC’s parliamentary leader.
The letter highlighted that the SIC did not participate in the last general elections as a political party and therefore did not secure a single general seat in the National Assembly. Even its chairman contested the last general elections as an independent and was elected as an independent member.
""About 86 independent members (mostly backed by the PTI) have joined the SIC after the general elections. However, confirmation in this regard has not yet been received by this secretariat from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

""Moreover, in its February 28 order regarding applications filed by the SIC for allocation of reserved seats in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Punjab, Sindh, and K-P, the ECP declared that the SIC is not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims due to non-submission of a party [priority] list for reserved seats.
""As it is a legal question whether the SIC can be classified as a parliamentary party or otherwise, keeping in view the aforementioned facts, the Honourable Speaker has requested to seek the legal opinion of the learned AGP on the matter.
“The AGP has been requested to furnish his legal advice on the aforementioned legal question at the earliest for the perusal of the speaker,” the letter said.
On December 22, 2023, the ECP stripped the PTI of its election symbol due to alleged irregularities in the party’s intra-party elections held on December 2.
The Supreme Court later upheld the ECP order, and the party’s candidates later had to contest the February 8 elections as independents.
The party’s winning candidates had later joined the SIC following an agreement.

8,SC maintains stay on SHC order on tax collections by Cantts,Bench refers sugar price issue to larger bench,"The Supreme Court maintained its stay order against a Sindh High Court (SHC) order to the cantonment boards to refund the tax amount collected under the property laws of 1958, and asked the Sindh’s advocate general to take fresh instructions from the provincial government.
A five-judge larger bench, led by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, heard the appeal of the federal government against the SHC decision regarding tax collection in cantonment boards. The bench allowed the boards to collect the taxes until the next date of hearing.
According to the appeal, a presidential order was issued in 1979 on the property tax law of 1958 and in 1985, the then Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime gave the presidential order a constitutional cover. The 18th Amendment in 2010 also did not touch the matter.
The court was told that the collection of tax by the cantonment boards was federal, and not a provincial, matter. During the hearing, Justice asked as to why the Sindh government did not make the law a provincial subject by enacting legislation.

Barrister Ayyan Memon, the lawyer for the private petitioners, argued that in 1988, the Supreme Court had laid down the principle that the measures protected under Article 270 of the Constitution could be reviewed and declared null and void.
The bench gave time to the Sindh advocate general to take instructions from the provincial government about any legislation. Until the next hearing on April 22, it said, the boards could collect tax under the 1958 Act, as the injunction against the SHC decision to refund the tax collected would remain intact.
Meanwhile, a three-member bench, led by Justice Shah heard the case related to the determination of sugar prices. The counsel for the sugar mills informed the bench that the case challenged the Price Fixing Act, 1977.
The bench referred the matter to the administrative committee for the constitution of a larger bench for further hearing of the case. The case was adjourned for an indefinite period.
The bench also took up a case against additional tax in electricity bills. The counsel for the petitioners said that the Registration Act was not applicable to the petitioner institutions.
He added that the general sales tax (GST) was already being paid by the institutions.
The court issued notices to all parties, including the federal government on the petitions and adjourned the case until April 25.

9,Nawaz concerned over IMF's electric shock,"How much more can people endure, PML-N asks","PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Monday raised concerns over the impending surge in electricity and gas prices under the directives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), questioning the extent to which the people could bear such burdens.
Addressing a special meeting of the Punjab government alongside Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, Nawaz Sharif stressed the pressing need to address the potential hike in utility prices imposed by the global lender.
Senior provincial ministers and officials were in attendance, including Marriyum Aurangzeb, Azma Bukhari, Bilal Yasin, Syed Ashiq, and Sania Ashiq, along with chief secretaries and other concerned authorities.
During the briefing, it was revealed that previous procurement methods subsidised wheat prices uniformly, benefiting both the impoverished and the rich alike.
However, mounting circular debts, now totalling Rs630 billion, posed a grave challenge to the government. If left unaddressed, experts warned the debt could soar to a staggering Rs1.1 trillion.
Meanwhile, the daily interest payment on loans alone amounted to a staggering 250 million, prompting the government to abolish general wheat subsidies.
The meeting resolved in principle to provide solar panels to farmers for tube wells in a move aimed at alleviating the burden of expensive electricity.
Nawaz Sharif reiterated the need to prioritise farmers' concerns, stressing that government funds should be dedicated to supporting agricultural initiatives. He also emphasised the importance of ensuring fair compensation for farmers' labour and shielding them from exploitation by middlemen.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif echoed these sentiments, stressing the importance of providing farmers with modern machinery and reviewing drip irrigation techniques.
She called for a comprehensive strategy to combat the mafia engaged in the sale of overpriced fertilisers to safeguard agricultural interests.
It is pertinent to note that Nawaz's coincide with the anticipated finalisation of a staff-level agreement. Reports suggested that Pakistan has pledged to implement timely escalations in electricity and gas tariffs, along with the elimination of tax privileges.
According to the reports, electricity rates are slated for another hike starting July 1st. Additionally, mechanisms will be established for periodic adjustments on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis to facilitate cost recovery.
