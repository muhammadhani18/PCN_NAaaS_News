0,PTI faces nomination roadblocks for by-polls,PTI seeks permission to hold rally in Islamabad on the nights of March 23 and 24," 
Despite clinching victories in the February 8 elections across the central and provincial landscapes, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidates are facing roadblocks in submitting their nomination papers for the upcoming by-elections.
Hammad Azhar, the acting president and general secretary of PTI Central Punjab, took to social media platform X on Monday to express his frustration.He stated, ""PP-147 Lahore Returning Officer (RO) Nabil Ahmed Memon refused to receive my nomination papers.
At 2 pm my representatives were told by the RO that I had not received the paper and office hours were over”.He recounted that when he contacted the officials of the Election Commission, they said that the time for submitting the paper had not yet ended, but then no one helped to submit the paper.
This is the seat that Hamza Shehbaz left.""In another instance highlighted on the party's official social media account, a video showed police and law enforcement agencies obstructing PTI candidates from accessing the RO Office to submit their nomination papers.
The post read, ""Qasira Elahi [wife of former Punjab Chief Minister and PTI Central President Pervaiz Elahi] is stopped by the police outside the RO's office on the second day too – the law of the jungle is in force in the country.""However, amid the challenges faced by PTI candidates in filing nomination papers for the by-elections, there were a few success stories as well.
One of them is PTI candidate Hafiz Zeeshan Rasheed managed to submit his nomination papers for PP-149 and shared the receipt of his nomination papers with the media.
These incidents echo the grievances witnessed during the nomination process for the February 8 polls. Back then, law enforcement agencies were observed snatching nomination papers from independent candidates aligned with PTI, and in some cases, even resorting to abductions of candidates and their representatives.
Initially, the caretaker governments bore the blame for such heavy-handedness, However, following the installation of the representative government, PTI has pointed fingers at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) for the alleged infractions.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) announced the election schedule for by-elections on national and provincial assembly seats across the country on Wednesday, March 13.According to the announcement, by-elections for vacant seats of the National and provincial assemblies will be held on April 21 nationwide.
This includes six seats of the National Assembly, 12 seats of the Punjab Assembly, and two each of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan assemblies.By-elections are also scheduled for one seat of the Sindh Assembly on April 21.
Per the election schedule, candidates could file nomination papers with the respective returning officers from March 16 to 18, with candidate names to be published on March 18.
The deadline for scrutiny of candidatures is March 21, and appeals against the decisions of returning officers regarding nominations can be filed by March 25.
The revised list of candidates will be published on March 28, while the last date for withdrawal of candidature and publication of the final list is March 29.Election symbols will be allotted on March 30, with polling scheduled for April 21.
PTI seeks permission for rally
In a related development, the PTI has formally applied for permission to hold a rally in Islamabad on the nights of March 23 and 24.
The request was submitted to the district magistrate.The application proposes three potential locations for the rally: D Chowk, F.9 Park, and Parade Ground, urging authorities to allow the gathering at any of the suggested sites.
In the event that holding the rally on March 23 proves unfeasible, PTI has requested alternative permission for March 30.Amir Masood Mughal, who also contested elections from Islamabad Constituency NA46, is overseeing the organisation of the rally, reportedly entrusted with this responsibility by the party's founding chairman.
Additionally, PTI is reportedly planning a long march and sit-in following Eid festivities, as part of its ongoing mobilisation efforts.

1,Islamabad United lift HBL PSL 9,Imad Wasim took five for 23 to prevent Multan Sultans from a relatively big score,"Islamabad United held their nerves to defeat in-form Multan Sultans by two wickets in a last-ball thriller to win the HBL PSL 9 for a third time at the National Bank Stadium in Karachi in the wee hours of Tuesday.
It was Multan Sultans’ third finals defeat on the trot. They posted a subpar total of 159/9. The Islamabad United finished the match with 160 -- thanks to Imad Wasim’s composed knock at the death that helped carry the team to victory on the very last ball.
Earlier, Imad Wasim took five for 23 to prevent Multan Sultans from a relatively big score. The all-rounder is the first player to claim a five-wicket haul in a PSL final. Usman scored 57 off 40 and Iftikhar showed his brilliance with undefeated 32 off 20 balls.
While chasing, Guptil hit 50 off 32 and Azam made 30 off 22 for Islamabad United. Khushdil took 2/21. With this triumph, United secured their third PSL title, after victories in 2016 and 2018. Their consistent success established them as the most accomplished team in the tournament's history.
The Islamabad United players waved the Palestine flags after winning the finals. The players did a victory lap around the ground with flags on their back in order to show solidarity with Palestine.

2,IMF huddles with envoys on bailout package,Pakistan shares new pension scheme with global lender,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday briefed European and American ambassadors on the progress of Pakistan's current bailout package as it extended discussions with the authorities.
The talks, stretching into their third day, were initially slated to conclude on Monday.
The government informed the Fund that it was planning to roll out a new pension scheme in July but challenges remained in its execution. The new pension scheme would reduce the post-retirement benefits of the government employees.
The sources said that the IMF hosted the ambassadors and representatives from at least nine European and Western nations and apprised them about the successes that Islamabad made under the current $3 billion stand-by arrangement (SBA).
The diplomats from the United States, European Union, France, Italy, Germany and Australia were among those who attended the briefing, according to the people privy to these discussions.
The foreign envoys were also told by the IMF that Pakistan showed the intention to express another bailout programme. However, the size and the duration of the loan were not clear at this stage.
The IMF informed the foreign envoys that Pakistan has made significant progress in achieving the programme objectives and there were encouraging results.
The lender also highlighted the challenging areas, mainly the low revenue collection, particularly by the provinces that now necessitate revisiting the National Finance Commission (NFC) award. A foreign diplomat inquired about the IMF’s position on the NFC award.
The people privy to the meeting said that the IMF was of the view that the provinces currently get a large pie of the federal taxes, which leaves no incentive for them to increase their own revenues from sectors like agriculture.
The IMF's position is that when the provincial shares would be reduced they may make efforts to enhance their own revenues.
At the moment, the transfers under the NFC make around 90% of the total provincial income. The Centre transfers 57.5% of its tax collection to the provinces as their share in the NFC.
The Express Tribune reported last week that the IMF urged Pakistan to revisit the NFC award aimed at striking a balance between the resources and the responsibilities of the provinces and the federal government.
During the envoys’ meeting, the IMF expressed concern over low revenues and emphasised that the federal government should increase its collection from real estate, construction and retailers.
On the privatisation issue, the IMF said that the government was making efforts to privatise Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). Three days ago, the Privatisation Ministry informed the IMF that it was planning to invite bids for the PIA privatisation by June.
The ministry was also separately working on a one-year, two-year and five-year privatisation plan for the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).
The IMF’s view on inflation was that inflation remained high and there was a need to tame it. During the ongoing parlays, the Fund’s advice to the State Bank of Pakistan was to maintain the tight monetary policy.
As a result, the SBP decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 22%, despite the core inflation decelerating to 18.1% in February. This has made the life of the bankers easy at the expense of the federal government and the poor taxpayers.
Separately, the US Ambassador Donald Blome on Monday met with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. The US embassy said that Blome and Dar discussed a wide range of bilateral issues, “including US support for economic reforms in Pakistan”.
Although Dar has been denied the Ministry of Finance, he still remains relevant and active in the economic matters of the federal government. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has made Dar chairman of a committee overseeing the outsourcing of three international Pakistani airports.
Talks extended
The Ministry of Finance said last Tuesday that the IMF talks would continue from March 14 to 18.
However, the IMF has extended the talks for another day. The sources said that today (Tuesday) both sides would hold discussions on the Letter of Intent to the IMF for the release and approval of the last loan tranche.
The Ministry of Finance spokesman did not comment on the reasons behind the extension. However, an official said that the talks were extended as the discussions could not be concluded within the originally agreed time frame. The IMF’s statement will be released after the successful culmination of the talks.
 
Pension meeting
The Ministry of Finance on Monday briefed the IMF about its pension reform plan. The IMF was told that the government has decided to implement the new pension scheme from July –the start of the new financial year 2024-25. However, the Fund was told that there could be some hiccups in the smooth rolling out of the new scheme.
The IMF was informed about the major contours of the new pension scheme. The government has a plan to give pensions to the existing employees based on the average of the last three years’ salary instead of giving it on the basis of the last month’s drawn salary. This would reduce the amount of pension.
Similarly, the IMF was told that there is also a proposal to reduce the commutation from 35% of the pension to 25%, which would lower the amount of cash that the retiring employee gets on retirement.
As against the existing list of 16 beneficiaries of a deceased pensioner, there is a proposal to restrict the pension to the widow of the deceased. In case of the death of the widow of the deceased, the next heir would get the pension for the maximum of 10 years.
In case the spouse of the deceased is also a government employee, the spouse would not get the pension, according to the briefing given to the IMF. According to another proposal, any government employee can get only one pension, as against the current practice of getting more than one pension.
Similarly, in case the retired employee is rehired, he or she would be given a choice to either get a pension or a salary. However, this proposal might face resistance from different quarters. The majority of the retired military personnel are rehired.
For this fiscal year, the government has allocated Rs801 billion for pensions, including Rs563 billion for military pensions.

3,Nawaz’s sons acquitted in NAB cases,Court finds Hassan and Hussain not guilty in three references filed against them in 2017,"An accountability court in Islamabad on Tuesday acquitted former premier Nawaz Sharif's sons, Hassan and Hussain, in the Avenfield apartments, Flagship investment, and Al-Azizia Steel Mills cases.
Earlier, PML-N supremo Nawaz, his daughter and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and her spouse Capt (retd) Muhammad Safdar were found not guilty in the case of the Avenfield apartments on November 29 last year filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on July 2017 in light of the Supreme Court’s order as well.
On the same date, NAB withdrew its appeal against an accountability court’s verdict to acquit the PML-N supremo in the Flagship reference.
Later, the Islamabad High Court acquitted Nawaz in the Al-Azizia case on December 12, 2023.
Apart from the Avenfield apartments, the SC had also ordered the anti-graft body to file the Flagship and Al-Azizia Steel Mills references against Nawaz and his sons.
On Tuesday, the accountability court, headed by Judge Nasir Javed Rana, announced its verdict reserved earlier in the day.
During the hearing, NAB prosecutor Afzal Qureshi informed the court that no appeal was filed against the acquittal of Nawaz's sons or his daughter Maryam.
He added that the main accused in the case had been acquitted earlier.
The petitioner’s counsel, Advocate Qazi Misbah, told the court that the IHC had exonerated Nawaz after relying on the same documents that supported Maryam’s acquittal.
Misbah read the short decision of Nawaz’s acquittal in the court.
Read: Nawaz sons' arrest warrants temporarily lifted
He said NAB had not filed an appeal against the exoneration of Maryam as if the main accused in the case was acquitted, the case could proceed on the charge of aiding and abetting.
In the Flagship reference, he continued that the PML-N supremo was acquitted by the trial court as NAB had withdrawn its appeal against its decision.
“The third case was the Al-Azizia reference. The Islamabad High Court acquitted Nawaz in the Al-Azizia case,” the counsel added.
“NAB did not even appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision to acquit Nawaz. Even if all the evidence is accepted, there is no chance of sentencing.”
The NAB prosecutor told the court that the anti-graft body had withdrawn its appeal to increase the sentence in the Al-Azizia reference.
Earlier, the same court granted Nawaz’s sons major relief by revoking its earlier order that declared them as proclaimed offenders and cancelling their permanent arrest warrants.
The court also admitted the plea for their acquittal and directed NAB to present the entire record of the cases.
Hassan and Hussain were granted relief after they surrendered themselves before the accountability court judge.
The brothers had returned to Pakistan on March 12 after the same judge suspended their arrest warrants on March 7.

4,"Warrants out for K-P CM, PTI leaders",ATC orders arrest of top PTI figures over May 9,"A Special Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday issued arrest warrants of several top Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders, including more than two dozen current and former assembly members, in 12 cases in connection with violent attacks on the sensitive state installations on May 9 last year.
Those, whose warrants were issued by ATC Judge Malik Ijaz Asif, included Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Senator Shibli Faraz, National Assembly Member (MNA) Zartaj Gul, MNA Zain Qureshi and others.
On May 9 last year, PTI supporters resorted to violent protests after the arrest of party founder Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. The rioters torched the residence of the corps commander in Lahore, attacked the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi and damaged other installations elsewhere.
The police lodged dozens of cases over the violent attacks and scores, including women activists, were arrested. A number of top PTI leaders also remained in hiding since then. The investigations into these cases still continued.
Judicial sources said that police investigation teams appeared before the ATC and requested for the issuance of arrest warrants to finalise the challans [indictments] in these cases. The ATC judge granted the police request.
The judge issued the arrest warrants of Ali Amin Gandapur, Shibli Faraz, Zulfi Bukhari, Shireen Mazari, in 12 cases over the attacks at the GHQ, Army Museum, a sensitive institution’s office and metro station in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

All these leaders were charged with conspiracy in the cases registered at RA Bazaar, Race Course, New Town, Civil Lines, Sadiqabad and other police stations. A significant name missing from the warrants list is that of former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi.
When contacted, PTI sources told The Express Tribune that the PTI leaders and elected representatives would seek interim bail following the issuance of the warrants against them. The sources added that they would get the certified copies of the court order by Wednesday.
On the other hand, several police teams had been formed to comply with arrest warrants. According to the police sources in Rawalpindi, raids to make the arrests were expected to begin in the wee hours of Wednesday.
