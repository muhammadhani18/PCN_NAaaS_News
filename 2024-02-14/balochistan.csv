In November last year, the caretaker government of Punjab, under the guidance of the ad hoc Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had laid the foundation stones for the upgradation of two wildlife sanctuaries namely, the Lahore Zoo and the Safari Park, with a strict directive to complete the reconstruction projects by January 31st.
Unfortunately however, where the project has visibly failed to meet the fixed deadline given the nature of the work, wildlife experts have expressed ample scrutiny on the viability and quality of such hurried projects, which in their urgency to meet a given deadline and display a nameplate, end up compromising the quality of the refurbishment work on wildlife sanctuaries.
“There is a difference between the construction work for wildlife sanctuaries and regular infrastructure. It is fairly simple to construct a road, underpass, or bridge, but there are numerous considerations to take into account when constructing a living habitat for birds and wild animals. Expediting such projects can result in substandard facilities among other pitfalls in the future,” explained Mian Hafeez, Former Director of Project for Punjab Wildlife and the Green Pakistan Program.

“The reconstruction project of the Lahore Zoo and Safari Park, which is slated to reach completion within a matter of months, requires at least one and a half to two years for quality upgradation,” he added.
Furthermore, experts from the Planning and Development Board have also specified that since concrete, cement and sand is to be used in the construction structure due to their increased sustainability and durability, it may take more time for the construction structures to solidify and mature adequately given the cold winter season. What is interesting to note is that despite, several wildlife experts voicing their skepticism about the completion of the project in a time frame of less than six months, the caretaker Chief Minister remained adamant at completing the project within just three months of its commencement.
The zoo’s sources further claimed that after the January 31st deadline passed, the caretaker Chief Minister gave another close deadline of mid-February for completing the reconstruction project of the Lahore Zoo and the Safari Park, costing a sum total of Rs5 billion.
According to the speculations of some policy experts, politicians push for projects to be completed quickly so that they may claim credit for them and have their names added to the plate before the next government takes charge.
Whether or not this applies to the case of the current caretaker administration, cannot be ascertained but what is for sure is that the reconstruction work is being unreasonably rushed with 70 per cent of the work already completed in the Lahore Zoo including the completion of the parking area, walkway, bridge over the lake, and the animal hospital with only a few areas including the lion’s enclosure, bear’s cage and reptile house still under construction.
Moreover, reportedly the Secretary of Forest and Wildlife Punjab has met with the officials of the Federal Ministry of Climate Change, including the DG Wildlife of the Lahore Zoo and Safari Park, requesting the federal government to issue permits for importing animals including elephants, pandas, and kangaroos from abroad, among a total of 146 wild animals that are being brought in from across the country.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Mudassir Hassan, Lahore Zoo and Safari Park’s Project Director said,” Much of the work has completed, the remaining will conclude by the end of February.”
