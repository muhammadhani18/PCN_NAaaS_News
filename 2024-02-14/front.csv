0,Maryam tapped for Punjab leadership,PTI founder nominates Ali Amin Gandapur for the chief ministerial position in K-P,"Maryam Nawaz, the political scion of PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, has been nominated as the party’s candidate for the coveted position of the chief minister of the country’s most populous province, Punjab.
The PTI, which claims a majority in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Assembly based on the 84 independent members who won February 8 general elections with the party’s backing, has picked its stalwart Ali Amin Gandapur as its chief ministerial candidate.
After a meeting at PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain's house, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif announced Maryam's nomination as the candidate for Punjab CM in a joint press conference.
“The decision to nominate Maryam for the position has been made by the party leadership and the Quaid [Nawaz Sharif],” said Shehbaz, who himself is nominated as the joint candidate of three major parties—PML-N, PPP, and MQM-P—for the position of the prime minister.
The PML-N, which has won 131 seats in the Punjab Assembly, believes that it is now in a position to form a government in the province. Interestingly, 140 independent candidates backed by the PTI have also reached the assembly.
The PPP has announced its support for the prime ministerial candidate of the PML-N. However, the party has not issued any policy statement regarding Punjab, where it holds ten seats.
The decision to nominate Ali Amin Gandapur as the next K-P chief minister was announced by the PTI’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan during an informal interaction with the media inside Adiala Jail.
""Ali Amin Gandapur will be the K-P's chief minister,"" he said, highlighting his party's strong position with 84 seats in the K-P Assembly. PTI’s Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan later announced the decision at a news conference in Islamabad.
Ali Amin Gandapur served as the federal minister for Kashmir Affairs in the last PTI government. However, Maryam Nawaz has no experience serving in a legislature or working in any executive position in a federal or provincial government.
She was elected as the PML-N senior vice president and chief organizer in January 2023, a move that did not go down well with some senior PML-N leaders, including Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. She won the election for the Punjab Assembly constituency PP-159 Lahore-XV by securing 23,598 votes in the February 8 polls.

1,JI gives thumbs down to PTI’s offer,Claims PTI ‘changed its stance’ on forming govt on national level,"A day after it took rain check on PTI’s offer to form a coalition government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) on Wednesday finally gave a thumbs down to cooperation with the party on a provincial level.
Despite ongoing discussions, the negotiations between PTI and JI reached a deadlock, leaving the formation of the government hanging in suspense.
The JI asserted that the matter was not merely about winning or losing; rather it was about the sacredness of the vote.
JI spokesperson Qaiser Sharif claimed that the PTI had ""changed its stance"" on cooperation in the upcoming government, stating that both parties had initially agreed to “cooperate at the national level in the national interest.”
Moreover, JI has planned to stage a dharna in Islamabad on Friday, protesting against alleged election rigging.
Within JI, a rift has surfaced regarding the prospect of joining forces with PTI to establish the provincial government.
Central Deputy Amir Liaquat Baloch had confirmed ongoing discussions with the PTI, revealing that the Imran-led party had signalled a willingness to collaborate for government formation.
However, on Wednesday, JI spokesperson Qaiser Sharif said the party's ""cooperation with the PTI at the national level will be for national interest, but PTI has now changed their position"".

“Jamaat will be happy with whoever the PTI allies with in K-P,” said Qaiser.
Baloch, speaking to the media, backed Qaiser’s stance stating that “there was talk of adjustment with the PTI at the national and provincial levels, not only in one province”.
According to JI’s statement, following the February 8 elections, the PTI contacted JI seeking a common strategy for government formation.
It added that the JI chief immediately consulted with the central leadership, and officials and established a committee consisting of the party's K-P chief Prof. Muhammad Ibrahim and Deputy Amir Inayatullah Khan under the leadership of Liaquat Baloch.
Baloch said the committee members contacted PTI’s Barrister Gohar Khan, Ali Amin Gandapur, Umar Ayub Khan and Azam Swati, and exchanged views on the poll results.
The statement added that the party informed the PTI of their concerns over the elections, stating that deliberately changing the poll results was a disgrace which would harm the country and democracy.
The party further said that it welcomes PTI-backed candidates who emerged victorious in the polls and offers them constitutional and parliamentary security and respect for the public's mandate at this difficult time for the party.

The party in its statement clarified that the PTI informed them of its desire to form a government only in K-P at the last stage of the inter-party discussions, after which the JI sought time for consulting its own leadership.
""If PTI requires JI's support to safeguard its independent candidates, we are open to the move and welcome the opportunity,” Baloch said.
Meanwhile, following the Jamaat-e-Islami's rejection of a coalition with PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sherani group has extended its hand in support of PTI.
The central spokesperson of the JUI-Sherani group, Shuja Mulk, conveyed in a statement that PTI stands independent and doesn't require additional alliances.
As Maulana Sherani's party, he emphasised that its alliance with PTI is rooted in the pursuit of true and real freedom. ""Our platform is there for PTI,"" he added.

3,Fazl rejects ‘rigged’ election results,JUI-F chief invites Nawaz to join him on opposition benches,"A day after his coalition comrades rallied behind PML-N’s Shehbaz Sharif for the top executive post in the country, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday tossed a political curveball, rejecting the ""rigged"" election results while extending an invitation to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif to join him on the opposition benches instead of chasing government dreams.
The JUI-F, nursing wounds from a bruising defeat in the recent elections, refused to take the electoral outcome lying down and announced kickstarting nationwide protests against the alleged electoral manipulation by ""anti-Islamic forces"".
Fazl, who was conspicuously absent during Tuesday’s press conference that breathed new life into PDM to once again support Shehbaz for the prime ministerial slot, came forward on Wednesday, calling for Nawaz Sharif to join him on the opposition benches rather than forming a government.
He also expressed reservations about the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) role which, he alleged, had been “dubious from day one”.
""Today, our central committee met, which has rejected the election results and expressed reservations about the role of the Election Commission of Pakistan, but JUI-F will play its role in the parliament and will attend it with reservations,” he said addressing a press conference.
He accused the election process of being manipulated at the behest of “anti-Islamic forces”.
He emphasised the party's commitment to maintaining strong relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, stating that their efforts in this regard were not accepted by the United States and Israel.
""JUI-F is an ideological force, which will not compromise on national issues. We will run the movement for our greater goals,"" Fazl declared, adding, ""The role of the ECP has been suspicious since day one.""
He went on to claim that the election results indicated widespread bribery and asserted that the party's candidates and workers faced threats and intimidation.
Maulana Fazl accused the police of being taken hostage in several villages, creating a tense environment for the elections.
""If the establishment thinks that the election has been transparent, then their narrative of the May 9 tragedy is over,"" he stated, challenging the credibility of the electoral process. He extended an invitation to Nawaz Sharif, urging him to join the opposition in their protest against the alleged irregularities.
Responding to questions, he clarified that the conflict was a matter of minds with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and not of bodies. He expressed the possibility of reconciliation if the PTI's stance changed.
Fazl concluded by stating that the JUI-F would initiate a protest movement across the country to press for the approval of their demands.
Fazl emphasised that the extent of rigging in the recent election surpassed even that of the 2018 polls.
He accused the Election Commission of Pakistan of being under the control of the establishment, claiming that the entire election process was manipulated.
""The election process was held hostage, with bribes influencing both victories and defeats. In response, we are initiating a nationwide protest movement to advocate for democracy. The decisions will now be made in the field, not just within the confines of parliament,"" Fazl declared.
Clarifying the party's stance, he emphasised their preparedness and independence, asserting, ""We did not come to the field hastily; we have made thorough preparations. We are not aligned with any political party, including PML-N. We will not endorse Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister candidate in parliament, as our party has prohibited him from forming the government. Therefore, we will not be part of any government. Those who believe in the rigged nature of elections should join our cause, while others can choose to remain indifferent.""

GDA plans mass sit-in
Meanwhile, the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) is gearing up to stage a sit-in in Hyderabad on February 16 against alleged irregularities in the general election.
The party has invited opponents of the PPP in the province to participate in the protest.
GDA leader and Qaumi Awami Tehreek (QAT) head, Ayaz Latif Palijo, extended invitations on Tuesday to Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and Sindh Taraqi Pasand Party (STP) to join the sit-in protest at Hyderabad Bypass.
Reportedly, Palijo held discussions over the phone with JI's Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and STP's chairman Dr Qadir Magsi, informing them that the alliance's leader Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi, who also leads the spiritual Hurr Jamaat, will spearhead the sit-in.
Palijo asserted that hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend the protest to voice their opposition to the alleged electoral malpractices.
""Pakistan's establishment seems to have disregarded the lessons from the partition of Bengal,"" he remarked, condemning the filing of FIRs against GDA's election candidates.
Meanwhile, at a press conference in Larkana district, GDA's Moazzam Abbassi and JUI-F’s provincial leader Nasir Khalid Mehmood Soomro highlighted Pagara's recent press conference, which they claimed, has exposed the extent of rigging.
""The primary purpose of elections is to foster stability in the country, but the post-election stock exchange downturn reflects a different reality,"" Abbassi remarked.
Soomro emphasised discrepancies between the results reported in Form 45 by presiding officers and those in Form 47 provided by Returning Officers. He stated that JUI-F is advocating for a nationwide re-conduct of general elections.

4,PML-N on the cusp of forming govts,"Secures significant presence in federal and Punjab assemblies with support from independents, allies","The PML-N is on the brink of clinching majority in both the federal and Punjab assemblies, solidifying its status as a dominant political force in the country's political landscape.
The party has reached the requisite numbers to establish governments at both levels, owing to the inclusion of independent members and the backing of allies such as the PPP, PML-Q, and MQM.
Currently, these parties collectively hold 159 general seats in the National Assembly.
Alongside 7 independent members, the PML-N commands 82 seats, the PPP holds 54, the MQM secures 17, the PML-Q claims 3, while the IPP and BAP have 2 and 1 seat respectively in the National Assembly.
The PML-N stands poised to secure 18 out of the total 60 reserved seats for women in the lower house of parliament. It is also positioned to claim 3 out of the 10 minority seats. Meanwhile, the PPP is anticipated to secure 12 reserved seats for women and 2 minority seats based on its current position.
Efforts by the MQM aim to secure 4 reserved seats for women, while smaller parties collectively strive for 3 women seats.
These concerted efforts could potentially bolster the coalition's strength in the National Assembly to 202 members, comfortably exceeding the support needed for a simple majority of 169 members.

Furthermore, the inclusion of numerous independent members into the PML-N has paved the way for government formation in Punjab, bolstering the party's influence in the province. The addition of these independents has elevated the PML-N's tally in Punjab to 151 seats.
To establish government rule in Punjab, a political party must secure 186 seats out of the total 371 seats in the provincial assembly. These comprise 297 general seats, 66 seats reserved for women, and 8 seats reserved for minorities.
In Punjab, each political party will be allocated one seat for women for every 4.5 general seats it secures, and one minority seat for every 37.12 general seats obtained.
As per the current party standings, out of the 66 seats reserved for women in the Punjab Assembly, the PML-N is set to secure 33 seats, while the PML-Q and PPP will each secure two seats. Independent candidates supported by the PTI may contribute to winning 28 such seats.
With support from 151 members, the PML-N has positioned itself to secure 4 minority seats. Once women and minority seats are filled, the party's strength will rise to 188 members.
However, with the inclusion of the PPP, PML-Q, and IPP in the government alliance, the coalition's membership in the Punjab Assembly will swell to 214.
Following a meeting at PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain's residence, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif nominated Maryam Nawaz as the candidate for Punjab CM on Tuesday.
“The decision to nominate Maryam for the position has been made by the party leadership and the Quaid [Nawaz Sharif],” said Shehbaz, who himself is nominated as the joint candidate of three major parties—PML-N, PPP, and MQM-P—for the position of the prime minister.
