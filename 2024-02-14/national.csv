0,Development spending 61% below target,IMF grants waiver after govt misses budget surplus target despite slowdown,"The interim government spent Rs191 billion on development projects during the first seven months of this fiscal year – a sum that is over Rs300 billion or 61% less than the target and underscores the implications of tough economic conditions.

The Ministry of Planning reported on Tuesday that the development expenditures amounted to just under Rs191 billion during July-January period of the current fiscal year. Its one-page summary sheet showed that the expenditures were equal to just 38% of the amount that the planning ministry had authorised for the spending for this period.

Under the Development Funds Releases Strategy, the government was required to spend Rs494 billion or 52% of the total annual budget during the first seven months of the fiscal year. But the actual spending was Rs300 billion less than the target.

The interim government has slowed down spending as part of its plan to meet the annual primary budget surplus target set by the International Monetary Fund. Despite slowing down expenditures during the first quarter, the government missed the target. The IMF gave a waiver to make Pakistan eligible for the $706 million tranche.

The significant gap between authorisation and actual expenditures underscores challenges in the fund release process, slow progress on schemes, and the capacity to spend allocated funds. Deliberate slowing down of development expenditures aims to offset higher current expenditures.

During the first review talks, Pakistan assured the IMF to fast-track spending after admitting delays in the expenditure of Public Sector Development Program (PSDP). Pakistan also committed to expedite the PSDP prioritisation and rationalisation process in line with recommendations, aiming to achieve savings of at least PRs 61 billion.

Last month, the National Economic Council asked provinces to take over 68 projects costing Rs121 billion. The NEC also placed a ban on further spending on parliamentarians’ schemes and prime minister’s initiatives. These three steps will save the centre a cost of Rs202 billion, including Rs112 billion during the current fiscal year.

Nonetheless, the chief ministers of Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) raised questions over the mandate of the caretaker government to make financial decisions having long-term implications. The chief minister of Sindh also cited Section 230 of the Election Act that limited the role of the caretaker government.

In its separate review of Pakistan’s public investment framework, the IMF has deemed Pakistan’s PSDP “unaffordable” due to limited fiscal space, noting a total cost of Rs12 trillion to complete approved projects, requiring over 14 years.

The planning ministry’s report showed that 19% of total spending in seven months, or Rs35.6 billion, was on parliamentarians’ schemes. The last PDM government authorised Rs61.3 billion spending for these schemes, but the interim government slowed down the process. The annual budget is Rs90 billion.

For the current fiscal year, the government estimated the release of Rs75 billion in foreign loans. The disbursements reached Rs43 billion in seven months.
Development budget allocations for provinces, special areas, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan were affected in the first four months. Against the annual allocation of Rs170 billion, only Rs40 billion was spent, still the biggest spending head followed parliamentarians’ schemes.

The National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) and Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) spent Rs7 billion on its projects against the annual allocation of nearly Rs55 billion.

The National Highway Authority (NHA) has an annual budget of Rs157 billion. The planning ministry authorised Rs94 billion in spending, but actual expenses remained at only Rs21 billion. There was Rs30 billion spending on the water sector projects against the annual budget of Rs90 billion.

Only Rs261 million was spent against the Rs70 billion special programme for prime minister’s initiatives. The interim government stopped these releases, which former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had set aside for projects of his own liking.

Where the federal government spent little on development, the provinces accelerated expenses under this head. The provincial spending exceeded projections in the first quarter, partly due to a Rs115 billion payment by the Punjab government to clear commodity operations debt and faster execution of PSDP.

1,Car sales surge 81% in Jan,"Despite YoY decline, sales reach highest level in eleven months","Pakistan’s auto sector has witnessed a promising start to 2024, with car sales for January hitting 10,500 units, marking an 81% increase from December 2023’s 5,816 units. Including non-PAMA (Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association) members, car sales totalled 11,700 units, up 72% month-on-month.
Despite a 5% year-on-year decline from January 2023’s 11,100 units, PAMA car sales in the first seven months of FY24 stood at 49,990 units, down 48% compared to 7MFY23’s 95,240 units. Factors contributing to the decline include escalating car prices, expensive auto financing, and low consumer purchasing power. Sunny Kumar, Deputy Head of Research at Topline Securities, said car sales reached their highest level in eleven months, driven by increased sales in January with demand for new year registrations.
On a positive note, tractor sales surged by 46% MoM and 12% YoY to 3,814 units in January 2024, reaching 27,225 units in 7MFY24, up 82% YoY.

Read Despite YoY decline, sales reach highest level in eleven months
Arif Habib Limited Auto Analyst Muhammad Abrar Polani attributed the spike in January 2024 sales to the new year’s buying effect, ease of import restrictions, and increased affordability due to declining car prices. He anticipates further sales recovery as interest rates are projected to be cut in March, boosting auto financing.
Indus Motors saw a significant increase in car sales, up 304% MoM to 2,762 units in January 2024, driven by the launch of the new Corolla Cross. Honda Car MoM sales also rose by 49%, with 1,339 units sold in January 2023 compared to 901 cars in December 2023.
Pak Suzuki Motors recorded 4,550 unit sales in January 2024, a 22% increase from December 2023’s 3,735 units. Motorbike and three-wheeler sales also surged by 27% MoM to 104,619 units in Jan-24, although sales declined by 5% YoY.
With the emergence of SUVs featuring Hybrid-Electric transmissions, Adeel Usman, CEO of Regal Automobiles Industries Limited, anticipated a sustained shift away from traditional Internal Combustion Engines in the coming years.

2,Rupee disparity grows amid political turmoil,"According to ECP rupee dropped 0.04%, or Rs0.13, to Rs281.32/$ in open market","The disparity in the value of the rupee between interbank and open markets widened to over Rs2 on Tuesday, compared to around Rs1.50 previously, signalling a potential return of currency volatility amid political turmoil.
The spread, however, stands at 0.72% (Rs2.01), remaining well below the International Monetary Fund’s recommended maximum level of 1.25%.
The rupee dropped 0.04%, or Rs0.13, to Rs281.32/$ in the open market on Tuesday, as per data from the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan|. This decline is attributed to an uptick in demand for the greenback, notably for Hajj and Umrah.

Conversely, in the interbank market, the currency remained stable at Rs279.31/$, up by 0.01% or Rs0.02 day-to-day, according to the SBP data. Previously, the disparity had widened to over Rs30-40 between the markets, causing significant volatility. However, efforts by the outgoing caretaker government, including crackdowns on currency smuggling, helped narrow the gap.

3,MSCI adds three Pakistani firms to Frontier market index,Expected to impact investor sentiment amid market fluctuations,"The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) has added three new Pakistani companies to its main Frontier Market Index, bringing the total number of domestic companies in the international index to 20 as of February 29, 2024, according to the latest quarterly indices review results on Tuesday.

Additionally, the global index analytics provider has added another 19 domestic companies to the MSCI Pakistan Frontier Market Small Cap Index and deleted four from the index after they no longer met the qualification criteria.
Following these adjustments, the total number of Pakistani companies in the country-specific index has risen to 56.

These developments are expected to attract foreign investment to the listed companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), thereby improving business sentiment and investor confidence in the domestic economy.

The quarterly review results apparently did not include an analysis of the potential impact of the recently emerged political uncertainty following the general elections held on February 8.

Topline Securities commented post-MSCI results, “After this review, Pakistan’s weight in the Index is expected to be around 3%. Due to this adjustment, we anticipate some net external investment flows, although the quantum will not be significant.”

The number of domestic companies surged in the global indices following their share price increases on the PSX in the recent past.

Read PSX rebounds on MSCI index review

To recall, the PSX benchmark index posted a return of 56% in the first half (Jun-Dec) of the current fiscal year 2023-24, reaching 62,451 points on December 29, 2023, emerging as one of the world’s best-performing markets in the half-year.
However, the market has remained under selling pressure since no single party won a clear majority mandate, suggesting the installation of a coalition government and a hung parliament in the country, which may face challenges in transitioning the domestic economy from the current stabilisation phase to the growth phase.

To highlight, Pakistan was reclassified to MSCI Frontier Market from Emerging Market in Nov 2021 as it did not meet the standards for size and liquidity, Topline added.

The three new Pakistani companies added to the MSCI Frontier Market Index include Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Interloop (ILP), and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGP).

The 19 additions to the Pakistan Frontier Market Small Cap index include Adamjee Insurance Company Limited, Agritech Limited, Aisha Steel Mills, Askari Bank Limited, Century Paper & Board Mills, Ferozsons Laboratories, Ghandhara Industries, Ghani Glass Limited, Hascol Petroleum Limited, IGI Holdings Limited, JS Bank Limited, Murree Brewery, Nishat (Chunian) Limited, Pakistan Cables Limited, Pakistan Stock Exchange, SG Fiber Limited, Sui Southern Gas Company, Treet Corporation, and Worldcall Telecom Limited.

The four deleted companies removed from the index include BankIslami Pakistan Limited, Fauji Cement Company Limited, Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited, and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited.

4,Cabinet divided over 69% gas price hike amid IMF warning,Secretary finance warns that delay beyond Thursday could cost Pakistan IMF’s $1.2b tranche,"Federal cabinet members remained divided on Tuesday over a proposed increase of up to 69% in gas prices, amid warnings that any delay beyond Thursday could cost Pakistan $1.2 billion, the last loan tranche from the International Monetary Fund.

The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had to defer approval after supposedly pro-IMF programme cabinet members also spoke against the fresh price hike, according to meeting participants.

The Industry Minister, Dr Gohar Ejaz, representing the textile sector, opposed increasing gas prices for in-house power generation plants of industrialists fuelled by cheaper gas. Two other members opposed gas price increases for residential consumers ahead of Ramazan. They also sought time to study the proposal, which was not part of the regular meeting agenda.

The finance minister, also chairperson of the Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, advocated for the withdrawal of cross subsidies paid by industrialists to fertiliser plants.

As a result, the ECC had to defer the summary that had sought up to a 69% increase in prices for residential consumers and up to a 45% raise for other consumers aimed at recovering an additional Rs242 billion.

The ECC will meet again today (Wednesday) to consider the summary. The IMF has set a February 15th deadline to increase gas prices effective from February 1st.

The secretary finance plainly told the ECC that without a price increase, the IMF would not complete the next programme review, which carries the bonanza of the $1.2 billion last tranche of the loan package.

This would be the third proposed increase in prices that the government has made in the past year. The proposed increase would throw an additional burden of Rs242 billion on consumers, including Rs37 billion that the government would earn in sales tax.

It was the second revision in gas prices by the caretaker government in the past three months after it earlier increased prices up to 1108% – the highest for the most vulnerable households.

The fresh revision has also placed the maximum burden on the most vulnerable households with a 67% or Rs100 increase per unit for domestic monthly consumption of 0.5 cubic hectometers (HM3).

Earlier this month, OGRA issued a determination for revised estimated revenue requirements (RERR) for FY 2023-24 for both SNGPL and SSGCL. According to the revised determination, SNGPL requires revenue of Rs592 billion and SSGCL requires revenue of Rs310 billion this fiscal year. The total revenue requirement has been determined at Rs902 billion, arriving at an average prescribed price of Rs1,596 per mmbtu.

Sources said that there were heated arguments on the proposal of increasing gas prices for industrialists in the range of 18% to 34%. The Petroleum Division has proposed that the existing distinction between export and non-export industries using gas for in-house electricity generation should be abolished.

It proposed that one unified price of Rs2,950 per mmbtu may be fixed for all types of industries. This would result in an increase of Rs750 per mmbtu – or 34% for exporters and Rs450 or 18% for the non-export sector using gas for captive plants.

The industry minister claimed in the meeting that captive power plants were using 90% of the allocated gas while the rest of the 10% was used by processing industries. His claim was confronted by the energy minister who said that the use of captive gas was 55%.

Only five sectors – textile, carpets, leather, sports, and surgical goods – were using subsidised gas, while other exporters did not benefit.

The industry minister also objected to putting nearly Rs100 billion burden of subsidising fertiliser and residential consumers. The finance minister backed Ejaz and asked to prepare a fresh proposal for ending the cross subsidy being availed by fertiliser plants.

However, in case the government decides to fix a uniform gas price for all fertiliser plants, it will put the fertiliser plants on the Mari Gas network at a disadvantageous position. The revenue requirement for the Mari gas network plants requires the per-unit price at Rs555 per mmbtu, but the average prescribed price set by the OGRA is Rs1596. This would put an additional burden on farmers who would pay Rs175 billion extra – a sum that would go into the pockets of provinces in the shape of Gas Development Surcharge.

The Petroleum Division has proposed that the feed and fuel gas price for Engro Fertiliser should be set at Rs760 per mmbtu – a surge of 31% – and Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim plant should be increased to Rs1,750 mmbtu, showing an increase of 29%.

The effective date for revised gas tariff for Engro Fertiliser should be March 1st, 2024.

Agritech and Fatima Fertiliser are currently getting RLNG from the SNGPL network. The proposed price for these plants will be Rs1,596 per mmbtu, which is the average prescribed price in case these plants are offered system gas on SNGPL.

The Petroleum Division had proposed that for protected consumers, the existing tariff slabs should be increased in the range of Rs80 to 100 per mmbtu – an increase of 40% to 67%.

For unprotected consumers, an increase in the range of Rs200 to 300 per mmbtu has been proposed that translates into a surge of 5% to 67%.

The domestic category will still avail a cross subsidy of Rs108 billion as the protected consumers category and the first four slabs of the unprotected category are priced lower than prescribed price, according to the proposal.

The prices for bulk consumption are proposed to be increased from Rs2,000 to Rs2,900 mmbtu – an increase of 45%.
For the CNG sector, the government has proposed that the prices should be increased from Rs3,600 per mmbtu to Rs3,750 per mmbtu, equivalent to the RLNG price, being the fuel for the majority of CNG producers in the country.

Other decisions:

A finance ministry handout stated that the ECC approved a proposal to allow the flour mills to import wheat and export wheat flour products.

The ECC also approved a summary of the Power Division regarding the “Commissioning of 1263 MW CCPP Punjab Thermal Power (Pvt) Limited, Jhang (PPTL)”. The plant would not be entitled to idle capacity payments for a certain period.

The ECC approved a Rs6 billion subsidy for the import of urea. It was clarified that no subsidy on this account has been allowed by the government during the current year. The ECC also directed that the provincial governments be approached to clear their respective arrears of subsidy on urea.

In order to provide relief to the general public during Ramazan, the ECC approved Rs7.5 billion subsidy for the Benazir Income Support Programme beneficiaries that is already given in the budget.

5,JJVL calls for deregulation in LPG Policy,"Pushes for fair market pricing to boost competition, investment","Jamshoro Joint Venture Limited (JJVL) has proposed deregulating the base-stock price of local Liquefied petroleum gas or imported LPG in the new proposed LPG Policy, allowing market forces to determine pricing. The government is currently formulating this policy to bolster local LPG production.

JJVL advocates for producers and importers to have the autonomy to set prices based on market conditions, fostering fair competition, which previous LPG policies failed to achieve. Chairman JJVL, Iqbal Z Ahmed, in a letter to the Director General of LG Petroleum division, highlighted the need for a transparent, fair, and investment-friendly policy.

He underscored that the only successful regime, which attracted investments exceeding $1 billion, was the LPG Deregulation Letter of 2000. However, this progress was revered with the LPG Policy of 2006, he said. He urged the government to refrain from favouring one segment of the industry over another, stressing the importance of a policy conducive to investment.
Read LPG price jacked up by Rs19 per 11.8kg

The proposed policy outlines obligations for LPG producers or Exploration & production (E&P) companies suggesting that the field owner of a discovered LPG extraction site should have the first right to set up an extraction facility. If, however, the E&P companies fail to do so within 12 months, the opportunity should be open to third parties under agreed terms, he said. He added that producers should also have the freedom to market LPG directly or through third parties, without granting exemptions of PPRA Rules to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) for LPG imports.

Incentives for local production are essential, Ahmed asserted, proposing a 10-year tax holiday from the Commercial Start Date (CSD), zero Petroleum Levy, a maximum GST of 5%, and duty-free import of production equipment. He added that private LPG producers should not be compelled to allocate LPG to SOEs, allowing them freedom in distribution while SOEs should establish transparent marketing mechanisms.

The JJVL chairman also highlighted the importance of quality control and import regulations, advocating for preventing the import of substandard LPG and permitting only companies with valid OGRA Marketing Licenses to import LPG.
Implementing these measures, Ahmed believes, will create a transparent, competitive, and investment-friendly environment in the LPG sector, benefiting both producers and consumers.

6,SSGC eyes substitution plan amid depleting reserves,Explores closed wells and tight gas amid LNG affordability concerns,"Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGC) is awaiting the government’s approval signal to create a cost-effective gas import substitution of over $1 billion a year. This strategy involves reutilising closed wells and encouraging exploration firms to discover tight gas. The move comes as imported gas (Liquefied natural gas) has become unaffordable due to massive rupee devaluation in recent times.
While briefing journalists at his office, SSGC Managing Director Imran Maniar highlighted the challenges associated with completing international gas pipeline projects. Projects like the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan (IP) lines are proving to be “very, very tough”. Additionally, gas prices through these pipelines have risen beyond domestic consumers’ purchasing power.
Maniar stated that supplying low-cost indigenous gas to industries is no longer feasible for SSGC. Therefore, blending imported gas (LNG) has been proposed as a way forward.
Furthermore, the supply of gas to SSGC from local fields is projected to further deplete to 500 mmcfd (million cubic feet per day) in the next four years, declining over 30% by 2028 from the current 720 mmcfd, he added.
The gas marketing firm was receiving 820 mmcfd from local fields this time last year, marking a 12% reduction to date. This decline is attributed to depleting domestic reserves of oil and gas, with no significant discoveries in the past two decades.
Maniar revealed that SSGC has identified closed wells with the potential to supply a total of 200 mmBtu (million British thermal unit) in the system. Reactivating these wells could save $80 million a month and $1 billion annually in gas imports, he said.
Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDC), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL), and Mari Gas have closed wells due to production costs exceeding the selling price of $6/mmBtu. Reactivating these wells would require an additional investment of up to $50 million. However, even with increased costs of $7-7.5/unit, SSGC could sell gas to local industries at $8.5-9/unit, which is still lower compared to imported LNG sold at $15-16/unit, said the MD.
The caretaker government has also approved a tight gas policy, offering $7/mmBtu to exploration firms compared to $6/mmBtu for natural gas at present. This policy aims to tap into tight gas reserves estimated at 25 trillion cubic feet, nearly double the reserves of Sui gas currently standing at 13 trillion cubic feet.

Read SSGC seeks hike amid Rs47b shortfall
Maniar stressed the need to encourage exploration firms by offering competitive prices, suggesting a rate of $7-8/unit to reduce import burdens and lower gas prices nationwide.
Pakistan currently imports 11-12 cargoes of LNG a month. The proposed solutions could potentially cut imports by 3-4 cargoes a month, according to SSGC MD.
“Our local exploration firms lack the expertise and technology to find the tight gas. The policy should encourage foreign firms to return to Pakistan along with their external investment,” he suggested.
Additionally, Maniar proposed the introduction of a coal-to-gas policy, leveraging Pakistan’s vast coal reserves in Tharparker to potentially produce 1,200 mmcfd, exceeding current natural gas supplies. While gas prices through IP and TAPI pipelines could overcome gas supply shortfalls, Maniar cautioned that residential consumers may find it unaffordable, highlighting its suitability for industries.
He also mentioned that gas marketing companies were paying local oil and gas exploration firms in US dollar-denominations instead of in rupee-value, contributing to increased costs due to recent rupee devaluation against the greenback. Regarding subsidised gas for fertiliser manufacturers, Maniar suggested ending subsidised gas sales to them and instead providing direct subsidies to farmers.
PPL, Mari find POL products
In related news, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) announced significant discoveries in the Hala Block, including 6 mmcd of gas and 452 barrels per day of oil from development well Adam 2.
“The development well will add hydrocarbon reserves, enable the energy sector to reduce the gap between the supply and demand of oil & gas during the current energy crisis in the country and will save significant foreign exchange for the country,” said a notification to the Pakistan Stock Exchange.
This discovery, a joint venture between PPL and Mari Petroleum, with 65% and 35% working interest.

7,PSX rebounds on MSCI index review,"KSE-100 index gains 161.61 points, settles at 61,226.92","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) showed signs of recovery on Tuesday, driven by Morgan Stanley Capital International’s (MSCI) addition of 19 companies to its MSCI frontier small-cap index in the Quarterly Index Review.
Following lacklustre prior sessions, the trading day commenced with an intraday low of 59,613.17 points. Pressure on the KSE-100 index persisted due to reports of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) disapproval regarding government proposals for power tariff rationalisation and the resolution of the circular debt crisis.
Despite these challenges, the market began its upward trajectory post-midday owing to upbeat news of $2.4 billion remittances surging by 26% year-on-year in January 2024. Additionally, reports suggesting coalition arrangements for the PM slot in forming a new government, and strong earnings in the oil and banking sectors further lifted the market.
Resultantly, the index touched an intraday high of 61,654.65 points right before its close, erasing all prior losses.
“Stocks showed recovery in the post-election rally at PSX after MSCI added 19 companies to its MSCI frontier small-cap index in the Quarterly Index Review,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Mid-session pressure remained on reports of IMF disapproval on government proposals for power tariff rationalisation and the resolve of circular debt crises.”
“Reports of coalition sharing PM slot forming a new government, upbeat data on $2.4 billion remittances surging by 26% YoY in January 2024, and strong earnings in the oil and banking sector played a catalyst role in a bullish close,” the analyst added.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded gains of 161.61 points, or 0.26%, and settled at 61,226.92.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, said that the “market opened on a negative trend where mainly Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum opened at a lower lock on the back of the news that IMF is not on board with the energy ministry’s tariff rationalisation and circular debt management plan. However, during the second half recovery was witnessed, and both the stocks managed to open their respective lower locks.”

Similarly, the cement sector witnessed a resurgence, with Pioneer Cement, Maple Leaf Cement Factory, and Fauji Cement registering gains of 3.19%, 3.09%, and 2.98%, respectively, culminating in a positive close, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that early declines saw the post-election decline extend to -7.14% (59,600) before a recovery to close above 61,000.
“55 stocks rose while 33 fell with Mari Petroleum Company (+7.5%), Engro Fertilizers (+3.44%), and United Bank (+2.56%) contributing the most to index gains,” it said, adding that Oil and Gas Development Company (-7.47%), Pakistan Petroleum (-6.25%), and Pakistan State Oil (-4.01%) were the biggest downside contributors.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal stated that the KSE-100 index commenced the session in the negative zone amid political uncertainty; nevertheless, it rebounded by mid-day.
“Going forward, a cautious approach is recommended,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 435.55 million shares against Monday’s tally of 349.97 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs15.97 billion.
Shares of 355 companies were traded. Of these, 188 stocks closed higher, 139 dropped, and 28 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 65.8 million shares, losing Rs0.06 to close at Rs4.15. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 30.1 million shares, gaining Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.23 and Pakistan Refinery with 28.6 million shares, losing Rs0.34 to close at Rs25.63.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs48.2 million, according to the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL).

8,‘AI training crucial for youth’,Experts call for widespread AI adoption to unlock opportunities,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) training is emerging as a lucrative avenue for fresh graduates, content writers, and tech enthusiasts to augment their income, outpacing traditional computer-related work, according to insights from AI strategists and consultants.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, experts argue that beyond the freelance and software programming sectors, AI can benefit businesses across various industries. Implementing and marketing AI within a business, they note, can enhance sales outcomes compared to traditional methods, underscoring the growing importance of AI in modern business strategies.
“For now, normalising the AI culture is essential. Afterward, even if we can’t adopt AI, we can build AI for international consumers. There is a high demand for effective datasets. Pakistani data engineers can work on collecting data and creating datasets to sell to various types of companies, which I believe is the lowest scale of benefiting from AI. Additionally, freelancers and companies must start exploring open-source AI models to further work and deliver to international organisations,” said eminent AI Strategist and Consultant Khawaja Fahad Shakeel.
He explained that AI or Machine Learning (ML) doesn’t rely on traditional hosting systems but instead requires Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to process algorithms alongside data. Currently, no organisations in Pakistan are investing in GPUs, leaving the market open to international companies. This heightened demand has led to profitable opportunities for companies selling GPU power for AI. Additionally, the scarcity of trainers contributes to the high cost, as AI/ML/Data engineering services are priced four to 10 times higher than conventional services. Consequently, AI experts struggle to find adequate time for training at lower rates.

“The same approach used for freelancing and conventional programming can effectively normalise AI/ML training in the country. Various initiatives, such as the e-Rozgar programme, Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority etc, can introduce AI programming initially and then advance to machine/deep learning. However, awareness of the significance of AI/ML is crucial,” he said.
Dr Mukhtiar Memon, a trainer at the Information Technology Department of Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), highlighted that AI processes vast amounts of data from diverse organisational domains and geographical locations, often in complex formats. He said that managing such extensive and intricate data requires substantial storage, network, and computation resources, typically provided by high-performance computers, contributing to the expense of AI. Memon illustrated this by explaining how AI-powered chatbots rely on multiple ML models to generate accurate responses and predictions. He underscored that these ML models are not only computationally intensive but also require specific applications or libraries for data training and user-friendly responses, demonstrating responsible AI practices aimed at fostering trust and scaling AI with confidence.
“Equipping youth with state-of-the-art AI skills not only expands opportunities in the global job market but also fosters entrepreneurship,” he said.

The Group’s revenue climbed by 25.8% to Rs190.6 billion in FY2024, driven by robust performance in the consumer segment. However, despite this revenue growth, the company faced a net loss of Rs14.1 billion, attributed to rupee devaluation and high interest rates throughout the year, compared to Rs10 billion in 2022.
The Group’s subsidiary, PTCL, achieved a 15.4% revenue growth to Rs96.3 billion. The company reported a net profit of Rs9.4 billion, the highest since 2013, marking a 3.7% increase from the previous year. Ufone, another subsidiary, witnessed a revenue growth of 25.6%, driven by ongoing network modernisation activities for Ufone 4G.
