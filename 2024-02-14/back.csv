0,Spur-of-the-moment decision,Nawaz ends his race to premiership for fourth time,"By 10pm Tuesday night, no one knew in the PML-N what the PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was thinking. On the television screens, his younger brother and former premier, Shehbaz Sharif, was busy cajoling people with his usual jugglery of words and assuring them that he would urge his elder brother to accept the position of prime minister of Pakistan for the fourth time.
Little did he know that Nawaz was watching his news conference live and, as the party spokesperson revealed, he decided that his race to the PM House should end here. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, she added. He asked the party spokesperson, Marriyum Aurangzeb, to draft a tweet and announce that the PML-N’s candidate for premiership would be none other than Shehbaz Sharif, and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz, would become Punjab’s chief minister.
For years, the party and its leaders have been shouting slogans of “Wazeer-e-Azam, Nawaz Sharif” – PM [would be] Nawaz Sharif. Even, when Shehbaz was the prime minister and during the election campaign, the party projected Nawaz as the next prime minister if PML-N comes to power. However, it seems, the split mandate and the last-minute adjustments left him with no other option but to nominate his brother and daughter and assume a new role for himself: the person who nominates people on key positions.
“Nawaz Sharif will assist both Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz,” Marriyum shared with The Express Tribune, adding, “He will help both in their jobs.” To a question if the jailed PTI founding chairman, Imran Khan, just ended Nawaz’s political career by forcing him to change plans seeing the split mandate in the polls, Marriyum refuted by saying that it is Nawaz, who is still nominating people on the premium and most powerful positions in the country.
“Nawaz Sharif is very much playing on the front foot,” Marriyum said in response to a question if he would continue playing his political role from behind the scene. Soon after the PML-N decided that Shehbaz and Maryam would lead the federal and Punjab governments, the social media was abuzz with questions if Nawaz’s political career was finally over. To the question if Nawaz was eying the office of President for himself, Mariyum replied in negative.
The sentiment was primarily based on an open secret that the powerful stakeholders are more comfortable in working with Shehbaz than Nawaz. When asked, a PML-N leader, while requesting not to be named, said that it was merely a perception that the establishment was willing to only work with Shehbaz Sharif.
He, however, admitted that the party was unaware until Tuesday night that Shehbaz would be becoming the prime minister once again. In the PML-N, he said, it was thought that Nawaz Sharif wanted to become PM again to get redemption and leave behind a rich legacy, especially, after being labeled as “chor, daku, corrupt, etc.,” – thieve, robber and corrupt, etc., – by the narratologist, Imran Khan.
He agreed that Nawaz wanted to be remembered as someone who nominated people on key positions; whether the country’s army chiefs or the PM or the CM, among others. However, the notion that the three-time ex-PM Nawaz Sharif’s political inning abruptly came to an apparent end was the buzzword on the social media and in the capital.
His decision to opt out of the PM’s race has come just hours after Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the PPP’s candidate for the PM Office, announced that he would no longer be putting himself forward for the candidacy of the prime minister of Pakistan. Strange as it may seem, those running for the PM Office have abandoned their desire just days after the country went for the general elections and busy cobbling up a new government for a five-year term.

1,PML-N’s last stint in power: Vawda,Former minister says PPP has extracted all the juice,"Former federal minister Faisal Vawda on Tuesday said personal interests and big egos had become the problem, stressing that the current situation in the country was the result of what had been sown.
Speaking in Express News programme ‘Kal Tak’ and an interview with a private news channel, Vawda said that what happened in the elections, was the same that took place in the 2018 elections as well as in the 2013 and 2008 elections before that.
He added that it would be like this even in the future elections. However, he emphasised that for the first time, he was taking “one positive thing” from this election: the next election and the system will be for the betterment of Pakistan.
In response to a question, Vawda said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) which was seen today was a caretaker PTI. “Where is the real PTI,” he asked, stressing that the PTI “will be out of the system if it does not become part of the reconciliation”.
To another question, the former minister said that whatever the PPP said, it would happen. “The PPP will take all the constitutional offices and the onus of everything will fall on the PML-N.” He warned that the biggest problem ahead was the payment of $24 billion in June.
On the speech of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif after the elections, he said that Nawaz should have shown his leadership ability. He should have offered the independent candidates an opportunity to form the government because they were the largest group. In fact, the independents were in no position to form the government.

2,Shah calls for caution amid PM slot contest,PPP leader voices reservations about Nawaz Sharif's candidacy for the coveted post,"As the political hustle for the prime ministerial throne continues, PPP stalwart Khurshid Shah on Tuesday voiced his reservations about Nawaz Sharif's candidacy for the post, asserting that prudence should prevail in the political landscape.
The former federal minister expressed concerns over the legitimacy of Nawaz Sharif's victory in Lahore, alluding to perceived irregularities and raising questions about the electoral process.
""As a political worker, I am of the opinion that we should not touch anyone's mandate,"" he asserted, stressing the need to uphold the sanctity of electoral outcomes.
He maintained that his party would not entertain the inclusion of elected members from other parties as the mandates given by the people should be respected.
He specifically urged against any attempt to lure PTI-backed members of the National Assembly away from their party as “the real mandate rests with the people”.
Khurshid Shah also urged against the pattern of rotating the tenure of the prime minister among specific political entities.
""Playing with one's mandate is like playing with people's sentiments,"" the former federal minister warned, adding that that the electoral outcomes must not be tampered with.
He also advised against fixating on numerical pursuits and urged them to adhere to their slogan of 'vote ko izzat do' (respect the vote) and suggested that alternative candidates such as Shehbaz Sharif or Ayaz Sadiq could be considered for the prime ministerial post.
Commenting on the rigging allegations, Khurshid Shah pointed out that the Supreme Court had a crucial role to oblige the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to announce timely decisions based on Form 45.
The PPP leader said that responsibility would fall on the judiciary if election tribunals deviate from their obligations.
Emphasising the PPP's commitment to the state's interest, Shah clarified that PPP’s decisions would be guided by a sense of responsibility rather than imposition.

3,SC throws out Jaranwala inquiry report,Regrets that authorities did not try to stop mobs from setting churches on fire,"The apex court on Tuesday dismissed a report presented by the Punjab government on the Jaranwala incident, noting that Punjab Police knew the people involved in vandalizing the places of worship of the Christian community but were afraid to name them.

The court also asked authorities to submit a new report on the incident in ten days, warning that in case of submission of an unsatisfactory report, the court will dismiss or suspend the relevant officials.

A three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Mussarat Hilali on Tuesday took up a constitution petition filed by members of the Christian community for an inquiry into the August 2023 incidents.

On August 16, 2023, communal violence erupted at Jaranwala tehsil of Faisalabad after alleged desecration of the Holy Quran. During the riots, dozens of churches, places of worship and properties belonging to the Christian community were attacked and vandalized.

The petitioners noted that never in the history of Pakistan have so many churches been destroyed in a single incident in a single day. “At least 24 churches and several dozen smaller chapels were burnt, thus, the present petition is of great public importance and is maintainable,” it said.

During the proceedings, CJ Isa said people complain about Islamophobia in other countries but here they are themselves involved in mistreating the minorities. “Do we want to emulate the treatment meted out to minorities in India?” he asked.

The judge lamented that police did not try to stop the mobs on August 16 and acted like silent spectators. He said police know the real culprits of the Jaranwala incident, but are displaying weakness and cowardice.

“By failing to stop the attackers, the police undermined public confidence in themselves. Apparently, the Punjab police appeared intimidated by the attackers of the Jaranwala incident,” the judge observed.
Justice Isa said as a citizen, it is embarrassing for him that Pakistan reports the highest number of blasphemy cases in the world. Some people, he said, have turned it into a business.

“Those who have no knowledge about Islam are pretending to be authorities. Islam prohibits attacks on places of worship,” he said.

The court also issued notices to the federal government, all the provincial governments, the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA)
It noted that both the government and the media must play their roles in combating extremism, violence, terrorism, sectarianism, and hatred.  The media should publish special messages promoting religious harmony under Section 20 of the PEMRA Ordinance, it said.

The court also gave the government two months to submit a report containing details of all the places of worship belonging to minority communities.

The court also directed authorities to publish complete details of all the Hindu temples and Sikh Gurdwaras along with their pictures on the website of the Evacuee Trust Property Board. The court later adjourned for an indefinite period.

4,Elahi secures bail in illegal hiring case,Lawyer says ‘bogus’ FIR was registered against PTI president merely to humiliate him,"The Lahore High Court on Wednesday granted bail to PTI president and former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi in an illegal recruitment case.
Elahi was booked by the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Punjab on charges of illegally recruiting a low-ranking officer as his principal secretary by misusing his powers when he was serving as the chief minister.
A single-judge bench, comprising Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry, heard Elahi’s bail petition.
Amir Saeed Rawn, Elahi’s lawyer argued that the police had no justification for keeping the PTI
president behind bars after the completion of the investigation, and requested the court to approve his client’s bail.
However, the law officer strongly opposed the bail request, and asked the court to dismiss the plea.
He added that there was substantial evidence to develop the nexus of Elahi with the offence.
The law officer contended that the then Punjab CM Elahi had illegally recruited Muhammad Khan Bhatti, a low-ranking officer, as his principal secretary, and no due process was adopted in the appointment.
Replying to this, Elahi’s lawyer told the court that all due process was adopted while appointing the principal secretary.
He argued that a bogus FIR was registered against his client merely to humiliate and embarrass him even though he had nothing to do with the case.
He added that Bhatti had been discharged from this case by a judicial magistrate, while Elahi was being subjected to political victimisation.
The lawyer asked the court to grant Elahi post-arrest bail.
The court directed Elahi to furnish surety bonds of Rs100,000 for availing the relief of bail.
The jail officials then produced Elahi and Bhatti before Accountability Court Judge Zubair Shahzad Kiyani in connection with the Gujrat development projects case.

During the proceedings, the defence counsel submitted to the court that clear copies of challan had not been furnished and requested it to adjourn the indictment proceedings till their provision.
At this, the court adjourned further proceedings till February 22 and directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to provide clear copies of challan to the accused.
NAB has accused Elahi and his son Moonis of receiving over Rs1 billion as kickbacks through intermediaries in more than 200 development projects of Gujrat district.
It is pertinent to mention here that Moonis has already been declared a proclaimed offender in the case because of continuous absence.
Moreover, an anti-corruption court also delayed the indictment of Elahi and other accused till February 22 in the Punjab Assembly illegal appointments case.
The court delayed the indictment because of the absence of a co-accused, Abdullah, during the proceedings.
It directed to produce the medical certificate of the co-accused before the court at the next hearing.
The ACE Punjab had registered the case accusing Elahi of unlawful appointments and receiving kickbacks.
Qualified candidates were allegedly denied positions while those who had not taken the exams were appointed.
The ACE claimed that as the then chief minister, Elahi had misused his authority by influencing appointments after taking bribes.

8,NA ready to swear in new members on Feb 29,President Alvi is empowered by Constitution to convene meeting within 21 days of holding elections,"A fresh session of the National Assembly in which the newly elected members will take oath as lawmakers is likely to be convened on Feb 29 – the date on which the 21-day constitutional period of holding the general elections ends.
National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf will preside over the inaugural session and swear in the MNAs.
According to the rules and regulations, the newly elected members must submit details of their election expenditures within 10 days of their victory as failure to do so will result in the withholding of their success notification.
The success notification will be issued within 14 days of the victory. After that, the allocation of 60 women and 10 non-Muslim seats will be conducted.
Following the announcement of the official results, independent MNAs will have a three-day window to join any party of their choice in parliament.
According to Article 21 of the Constitution, the National Assembly session must be called within 21 days of elections, though it can also be summoned earlier.
As per Section 91(2) of the Constitution, the president is required to summon the session of the National Assembly within 21 days following the official announcement of election results or the issuance of its notification.
“The National Assembly shall meet on the twenty-first day following the day on which a general election to the assembly is held, unless sooner summoned by the president,” the section says.
Following the election of the speaker and his deputy, the selection of a new prime minister will take place via secret ballot.
The newly elected prime minister is expected to assume his responsibilities in the first week of March.
To elect the prime minister, the assembly will be divided into two sections, with members tallied accordingly based on this division.
According to Section 91(4), the prime minister “shall be elected by the votes of the majority of the total membership of the National Assembly, provided that, if no member secures such a majority in the first poll, a second poll shall be held between the members who secure the two highest numbers of votes in the first poll and the member who secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting shall be declared to have been elected as prime minister, [and] provided further that, if the number of votes secured by two or more members securing the highest number of votes is equal, further poll shall be held between them until one of them secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting.”

9,IHC summons PM again in Baloch students' case,Notes that people involved in enforced disappearance should be awarded multiple death sentences,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC), angered by the government’s inability to recover missing Baloch students, has summoned Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar once more. He is ordered to appear before the court on February 19.
Presided over by IHC Senior Puisne Judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, a single-member bench resumed hearing a petition filed by human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari regarding the alleged enforced disappearance of over 50 Baloch students.
During the proceedings, Assistant Attorney General Usman Ghuman informed the court that another missing student had been recovered. Requesting an adjournment, he stated that Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan was unavailable. The Islamabad advocate general also sought an adjournment, citing the government's need for additional time.
Expressing extreme displeasure at the government’s failure to recover the students, Justice Kayani remarked on his benevolence in refraining from summoning the directors general (DGs) of the country's two prime intelligence agencies.
He noted that the punishment for kidnapping for ransom is capital punishment and advocated for multiple death sentences for those involved in enforced disappearances.
The court directed the caretaker prime minister to appear on Monday morning at 10 o'clock to explain why a case should not be filed against him. The court later adjourned until February 19.
Earlier, on November 22, 2023, the court had instructed the government to recover 55 missing students from Balochistan within seven days.
Read: ‘If anyone can resolve missing person issue, it’s me’, says Bilawal
 
Failure to comply would result in the caretaker prime minister appearing in court on November 29, 2023, accompanied by the caretaker ministers and secretaries for interior and defense, it had said.
However, on November 29, the interim PM had not appeared in court due to a foreign visit.
During the hearing, attended by caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bughti, the court had warned that if the missing individuals were not found, it would order the registration of a first information report (FIR) against the interim PM and interior minister.
The court had later released a written order reviewing the implementation of recommendations proposed by a commission on the missing Baloch students. According to the order, 69 Baloch students were subjected to racial profiling, harassment, and forced disappearance.
Of these students, some later returned home, while 50 remained missing. ""Former IHC chief justice Athar Minallah had constituted the commission. The additional attorney general confessed that some students were still missing,"" the order stated.
The order criticized the interim prime minister and interior minister, both from Balochistan, for failing to take positive steps on the matter.
""Even after 21 hearings, the absence of positive results is an insult to the Constitution of Pakistan.
There is no way out except to summon the prime minister, ministers, and secretaries to inform the court why the matter is not being given due importance,” it concluded.
