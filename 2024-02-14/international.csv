2,Differences in JI over alliance with PTI,"Central leader, K-P provincial chief disagree over coalition issue","In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Jamat-e-Islami (JI) faces internal discord regarding the inclusion of PTI-backed independent candidates into the JI fold in the provincial assembly. 
Central Naib Amir of JI, Liaqat Baloch, affirmed this alliance, while the K-P Provincial Amir, Professor Muhammad Ibrahim, refuted it.
Liaqat Baloch stated that JI had been in communication with PTI, aiming for an alliance to form the provincial government. He expressed JI’s willingness to welcome PTI-backed independent candidates. 
Conversely, Professor Ibrahim asserted there was no alliance with PTI, criticizing the ethical implications of using JI’s name without consensus.
This divergence in opinion among the JI leadership, as reflected in contrasting statements from the central and provincial tiers of the party, underscores the complexity of coalition-building and the intricacies of political alliances in the region.
Baloch’s statement highlights JI’s proactive engagement with PTI and its readiness to embrace potential allies from within PTI’s support base.
Ibrahim’s position underscores a more cautious approach, expressing skepticism regarding the reported collaboration and raising ethical concerns about the unauthorized use of JI’s name in conjunction with PTI without formal consensus within the party.

Read JI confirms contact with PTI over possible government formation
Baloch had a telephonic conversation with PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar, Ali Amin Gandapur, and Senator Azam Swati in this regard, following which JI gave its consent for unified action.
Amidst these divergent perspectives, the internal dynamics within JI are further complicated by recent electoral setbacks. 
JI suffered significant setbacks in Tuesday’s recounting of votes, losing all three provincial assembly seats it initially secured in K-P. The recounting process, conducted in PK-20 Bajaur II, PK-21 Bajaur III, and Dir Lower, revealed a shifting political landscape, with PTI candidates emerging victorious in the aftermath of contested results.
In PK-20 Bajaur II and PK-21 Bajaur III, where JI candidates had initially clinched victory, the recounting of votes resulted in a reversal of fortunes, with PTI candidates securing the seats previously held by JI. 
Similarly, in Dir Lower, JI’s candidate faced defeat in the recounting process, signaling a sobering reality for the party as it grapples with the implications of electoral setbacks and recalibrates its political strategy.
Meanwhile, the broader political landscape in Pakistan witnesses strategic maneuvering by PTI, as it seeks to consolidate its position and forge alliances to strengthen its grip on power. 
PTI’s announcement of its intention to form governments in both the Centre and Punjab, alongside alliances with the Majlis-e-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) and JI in K-P, reflects a calculated approach to coalition-building aimed at maximizing political leverage and securing stability in governance.

3,Tribesmen rally against fatal shooting,Three killed when police opened fire at protesters,"Thousands of tribesmen on Tuesday rallied in Miranshah, North Waziristan, protesting the fatal shooting of NA-40 candidate Mohsin Dawar, which claimed three lives and left several injured.
Local residents, along with members of the NDM party and the Darpa Khel clan, turned out in force for the demonstration. Notably, Mohsin Dawar hails from the Darpa Khel sub-clan of Dawars.
The impassioned protestors blockaded the Miranshah-Mir Ali and Miranshah-Datta Khel Roads, halting all vehicular traffic. 
Marching from Tableghi Markaz to Miranshah Press Club, the crowd vociferously denounced the police for what they deemed unjustified firing.
Leading the protest were Malik Saifullah Darpa Khel and Adil Dawar, among others. They accused the authorities of electoral malpractice, alleging that Mohsin Dawar had won the polls, yet another candidate was declared the victor.

Expressing outrage, they demanded a judicial inquiry into the shooting, which also wounded Mohsin Dawar. They insisted on the swift arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the deadly gunfire, labeling it an act of state brutality against unarmed demonstrators.
Adil Dawar, a prominent NDM leader, vowed to sustain the protests until justice prevailed, emphasizing their determination to see Mohsin Dawar rightfully acknowledged as the election winner by both the government and the Election Commission of Pakistan.
“If the government intended to select, they should have declared it before the polls,” he remarked, condemning the police for firing on innocent, unarmed protestors, resulting in three fatalities.
However, negotiations led by DSP Miranshah, Syed Jalal Wazir, tempered the tensions, persuading the protestors not to escalate the situation further. Wazir clarified that no policemen were injured or killed in the previous day’s firing, seeking to defuse the volatile atmosphere.
