In the National Assembly, only MQM and PML-N awarded the tickets more than 5% tickets to women while PPPP, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), Awami National Party (ANP), Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), JUI-F and BNP have not met the said requirement.

BNP and JUI (F) did not grant any ticket to a female candidate.
For Punjab Assembly, only Pakistan Milli Muslim League (PMML), JUI (F) issued tickets to over 5% female candidates but MQM, PML-N, PPPP, JI, ANP and TLP ignored it.

Executive Director Aurat Foundation Naeem Ahmad Mirza while writing to Chief Election Commissioner has asked for taking notice of the violation.
He wrote, “We request the Election Commission of Pakistan to take notice of this violation of Election Act 2017 and Code of Conduct for the Political Parties, because the 5% restriction is already a low ceiling, and if parties continue to show disregard to women in providing them opportunities to mainstream them into electoral processes, it would mean denying half the population of their due fundamental rights under the Constitution of Pakistan.”
