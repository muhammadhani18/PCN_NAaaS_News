0,PAC hosts vibrant Kashmir solidarity event,Showcases Kashmir history & culture; lively performances echo sentiments of support,"The Punjab Arts Council (PAC) organised a photo exhibition and walk to commemorate Kashmir Solidarity Day.
The event was marked by a flag hoisting ceremony in which the flags of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir were raised as a demonstration of Kashmiri’s strength and resilience. This was then followed by observing a minute’s silence to honour the oppressed Kashmiris living in occupied territory. 
The exhibition also featured performances such as tableaus, speeches and Kashmiri song competitions which were organised with the support of the All Pakistan Private Schools Management Association.
The General Secretary of All Party Hurriyat Conference Azad Kashmir Pakistan Chapter, Sheikh Abdul Mateen, was present at the event alongside the chapter’s Information Secretary, Imtiaz Wani. Sheikh Abdul Mateen said on the occasion “The worst kind of atrocities in Occupied Kashmir have exposed the real face of India in front of the whole world. Such atrocities are rarely found in human history. The anti-Kashmir cruel policies of the Hindutva government of India, however, have not changed the reality of Kashmir.”
He further said that the dream of world peace can never be fulfilled without the freedom of Occupied Kashmir. “Till today millions of Kashmiris have sacrificed their lives for freedom and the only demand of Kashmiris is that they should be given the right of self-determination.”

Imtiaz Wani reinforced his companion’s points by adding that “The entire humanity is ashamed of Indian atrocities against the Kashmiri people, and it is a disgraceful stain on human history and conscience, so every Pakistani and every peaceful person in the world should raise their voice for the Kashmiri people’s right of self-determination. The Muslim Ummah and the United Nations should play their role in resolving the Kashmir issue.” 
Director of Arts Council Waqar Ahmed, who was also present at the exhibition, said that Pakistan has always strongly supported the right of self-determination of Kashmiris at the political, moral and diplomatic level. 
“It is Pakistan's principled position that the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people under the UN resolutions,” he said.
The exhibition displayed photos related to Kashmiri history and culture and the performances celebrated the people of Kashmir. The song competition allowed young students a chance to learn about Kashmir and express their solidarity with its people.
Among the winners of the competitions, Eagle Public School won first position in the tableau performances, Ames School System got second position, Alfarooq Public School got third position and Green Valley School came fourth place. As for the speech competition, Masooma, Tahnia Abid, Sahar Fatima and Sair secured first, second, third and fourth positions respectively. In the Kashmiri song competition, Miva came first, Shayan came second, Ayesha came third and Iman Fatima came fourth.

1,President rejects appeal of workplace harasser,Dr Alvi stresses serious consequences of harassment on women,"President Dr Arif Alvi has upheld the penalty of “dismissal from service” imposed upon a bank manager after he was found guilty of the charges of sexually harassing a female colleague at the workplace.
While rejecting the representation filed by the accused, Mr Muhammad Munir Akhtar, a former employee of the Askari Bank Ltd (ABL), against the decision of the Federal Ombudsman for Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace (FOSPAH), the president said that the incidents narrated in the complaint against the accused, when juxtaposed with the evidence, established the guilt of the accused for the charges of harassment.
The case was filed by a female employee of ABL under section 8 of the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010 against the accused who was a staff member of the ABL, Hassanabdal branch. 
She relayed in her case that the accused Bank Manager Muhammad Munir Akhtar, along with his friend had made it difficult for her to work in the branch by creating an offensive workplace environment. She alleged that the accused had forced her to go with his friend and after she was transferred to another branch, when she went to collect her card from the Hassanabdal branch, she was verbally abused by him, and he refused to hand over her ATM card.

Following her complaints, the departmental harassment committee probed into her allegations and, after inquiry, concluded that the accused was indeed harassing the female employee and he was accordingly dismissed from service. 
The accused then filed an appeal with FOSPAH, which was dismissed, after which, he filed a representation with the President.
The president in his decision observed that the accused had duly admitted the allegations about calls, text messages, and denial to hand over her ATM card to the complainant deliberately. “Facts admitted need not be proved,” he added.
The president further made it clear that workplace harassment could have very serious consequences for working women as they can risk losing their jobs or the chance of promotions if they refuse to give in to the unethical demands of someone in authority. 
“The unwelcome conduct of co-workers makes the working conditions hostile and unpleasant, putting indirect pressure on women to leave their jobs”, he added. He remarked that sometimes a woman employee can be so traumatised by the harassment that she may suffer serious emotional and physical consequences and become unable to perform her job properly.
