0,Industrial subsidies burden may be cut by 91%,Plan will increase burden on consumers using over 400 units by 41% or Rs22 billion,"The International Monetary Fund has agreed to review a proposal backed by the Special-Investment Facilitation Council aimed at reducing the subsidy burden of the industrial sector by 91%. This initiative aims to make Pakistani exporters more regionally competitive by potentially lowering their monthly bills by up to 29%.
Pakistani and IMF authorities are scheduled to hold virtual discussions early next week. The IMF’s endorsement could lead to a reduction in electricity bills for large industrialists and small manufacturers, ranging from 16% to 29%, according to government sources.
The IMF will also assess the practicality of the government’s plan to write off the Rs268 billion commercial debt of Pakistan International Airlines, incorporating it into the public debt. Additionally, the Rs1.28 trillion energy sector circular debt reduction plan will be taken up by the IMF early next week.
The proposals, including cleansing the PIA balance sheet, lowering electricity bills for industrialists, and eliminating Rs1.27 trillion circular debt, have been vetted by the 9th session of the SIFC during its February 2nd gathering.
The 9th session has clarified the future role of the SIFC, expected to be further strengthened post the February 8th elections based on the past eight months’ experience of the civil-military joint body. A new legislation might be introduced in the next Parliament to make SIFC decisions binding without compromising the authority of the federal cabinet. A transition of the SIFC work from the interim cabinet to the new federal cabinet will be facilitated through briefing sessions, according to sources.
Elements causing hurdles in the smooth functioning of the SIFC might be weeded out in the process. In recent days, two non-cooperative federal secretaries have been sent home without new responsibilities after their transfers.
Sources said the power tariff rationalisation plan has been transmitted to the IMF, but it comes with its own pitfalls. While it reduces the cross-subsidy burden of the industrial sector by 91% or Rs222 billion, it increases the subsidy burden on residential consumers using over 400 units by 41% or Rs22 billion. Currently, residential consumers are paying Rs200 billion in subsidies and may face an additional burden through Rs50 to Rs3,000 per month fixed charges in their bills.
Over time, successive governments have shifted the responsibility of providing affordable electricity to residential consumers by charging subsidies from other residential, industrial, and commercial consumers. This year’s estimated annual cost of electricity subsidies is Rs631 billion, with Rs473 billion funded by residential, industrial, and commercial consumers, and only Rs158 billion by the government, as per the Ministry of Energy officials.
Read Rs975b power subsidies proposed
The share of industrial consumers in cross-subsidy is Rs244 billion, expected to reduce to Rs22 billion – a 91% lower burden. Consumers using up to 400 units monthly receive Rs592 billion subsidies at Rs13.65 per unit rate. Out of this, Rs592 billion goes to lifeline and protected consumers, amounting to a burden that the federal government should bear instead of passing it on to other consumers.
The industrial consumer pays Rs8.61 per unit subsidy, while the residential consumer with consumption above 400 units pays Rs5.88 per unit. The Energy Ministry proposes fixed charges on all types of residential consumers to reduce cross-subsidy for industrial consumers. It suggests Rs50 per unit fixed charge on 50 units monthly consumption, Rs150 on 100 units monthly consumption for lifeline consumers, Rs300 fixed charge on 100 units monthly consumption for non-lifeline consumers, and Rs450 per month on up to 200 units for protected consumers.
Proposed charges also include Rs450 to Rs3,000 per month fixed charges for unprotected residential consumers with monthly consumption ranging from 1 unit to above 700 units. Subject to IMF approval, cross-subsidy to domestic consumers using less than 400 units would be reduced by Rs161 billion to Rs431 billion. The energy ministry claims that the prices of lifeline and protected consumers have not changed since 2021, despite a 50% increase in average prices.
Industrial cross-subsidy will decrease from Rs244 billion to Rs22 billion, with no net increase for them due to a reduction in variable charges. These changes would lead to an overall effective industrial tariff ranging from Rs8.5 cents per unit to 11.75 cents per unit. The Indian effective industrial tariff is 10.5 cents, including a 7.46 cents variable tariff.
After revision, electricity prices for cottage industry would decrease by 28%, SMEs and power looms prices would be cut by 16%, large industry bills would go down by 29%, and cement and chemical plants tariffs would be reduced by 28.7%. In absolute terms, there will be a Rs7 to Rs12 per unit reduction in electricity prices for industrial consumers, according to the proposed plan.
However, residential bills will increase by 4% to 39% due to the imposition of fixed charges in lieu of the withdrawal of a net Rs200 billion cross subsidy. The maximum increase of 39% is for up to 100 units of protected consumers, whose bills are estimated to increase from Rs774 to Rs1074 per month. However, their prices after an increase would still be lower than the average production cost, as they would continue to receive subsidies.

2,Govt to reconsider privatisation of LNG plants,"Ministerial group cites challenges, risks in circular debt-plagued power sect","The Ministerial Group has cautioned against the privatisation of two LNG power plants, citing concerns about the current investment climate. The government’s intention to privatise these plants, established during the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s tenure with an LNG contract signed with the government of Qatar, is under scrutiny.
Sources reveal that the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) directed the consideration of privatising two RLNG (Re-Gasified Liquefied Natural Gas) Power Plants. The committee constituted a Ministerial Group following the apex committee’s directions to evaluate the possibility of privatising Haveli Bahadur Shah and Balloki RLNG Power Plants.
After thorough deliberation, the Ministerial Group asserted that the privatisation of these two LNG power plants is not advisable at the present time, considering the overall investment climate. The group highlighted potential gains from future tariffs, estimated at Rs130.8 billion, and pointed out a payout to clean books amounting to Rs264 billion. It also noted that RLNG power plants had already generated a profit of Rs153 billion.
Qatar has expressed interest in acquiring these LNG-based power plants. In 2021, the cabinet committee on energy exempted LNG-based power plants from a 66% guaranteed off-take of LNG, despite the potential financial strain on gas utility Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the power plants. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf government also contemplated exempting the LNG power plants from the merit order.
Impact on the Power Sector and RLNG Supply Chain
The power sector plays a pivotal role in the re-gasified LNG supply chain, and any disruptions in RLNG supply/demand impact the economic dispatch of power, leading to high line pack issues in the gas transmission system.
When RLNG supply falls below the firm order, the basket price of electricity rises compared to situations when supply follows demand. Lower RLNG supply causes operational constraints and system stability issues for the system operator. Conversely, the basket price is affected when the plants are compelled to accommodate RLNG oversupply by gas companies. The take-or-pay contractual arrangements for the three RLNG-based power plants specify a minimum fuel offtake requirement of 66% annually, as established under the Annual Production Plan. The decision to exempt RLNG power plants from guaranteed offtake was made by the Cabinet Committee on Energy following the demand of the then privatisation minister during the PTI government.
Read Privatisation of LNG plants, DISCOs put on fast track
Private parties advocating for the exemption, particularly those interested in acquiring these LNG power plants, pressed for the move. Sources reported that Qatar’s interest in acquiring these LNG power plants prompted the exemption of guaranteed offtake to enable control of LNG supply.
Currently, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) supplies LNG to SNGPL, which distributes it to the LNG power plants. Guaranteed offtake also involves damages if LNG power plants do not take at least 66% of supplies. Thus, the decision to exempt these power plants from 66% guaranteed offtake aimed to safeguard private investors from potential damages.
Challenges and Recommendations
Experts caution that the privatisation of these LNG power plants is not a straightforward process, as the power sector is grappling with circular debt that continues to rise. Payment issues for electricity supplies remain a major concern, with circular debt in the LNG sector emerging as a key factor in the overall circular debt in the power sector.
Several challenges lie ahead, even if the government decides to proceed with the privatisation plan. Experts further recommend that the government address the issues of power distribution companies (Discos), which are significant contributors to the circular debt.

3,Indonesia c bank: No room to cut rates,BI raised key policy rate by 250 basis points from Aug 2022 to Oct 2023,"Indonesia’s central bank has room to lower interest rates this year to lift economic growth, but is waiting for the rupiah to strengthen against the dollar, Governor Perry Warjiyo said on Saturday.
“If we rush while the global condition is in disequilibrium, the rupiah could weaken and inflation goes out of control,” he told a media gathering. He said global economic fragmentation caused the disequilibrium.
Bank Indonesia (BI) raised its key policy rate by 250 basis points from August 2022 to October 2023 to 6% to ensure rupiah stability and keep inflation under control.
Warjiyo has repeatedly said Indonesia has room to loosen monetary policy, likely in the second half of this year, as global uncertainty has begun to ease and the Federal Reserve is also expected to trim US interest rates by then. Meanwhile, inflation in Southeast Asia’s largest economy in January eased further to 2.57%, close to the midpoint of the central bank’s target range this year of 1.5% to 3.5%. The rupiah has recently been volatile amid developments in domestic politics ahead of Feb 14 legislative and presidential election and changes in global sentiment for risky assets as investors predict the Fed’s next move.
Read Pakistan, Indonesia enjoy strong brotherly relations, says envoy
Monetary easing in Southeast Asia’s largest economy would help bolster growth while the economy is in an upward cycle of growth, the governor said, adding he expected to the cycle to peak in 2026.
However, the magnitude and length of BI’s easing cycle would depend on how fast Indonesia’s economic growth turned out to be, particularly with an expected transition of power in the government, Warjiyo said.
BI expects the economy to grow between 4.7% and 5.5% this year, compared with last year’s 4.5%-5.3% outlook.
Asked whether BI would trim banks’ reserve requirement ratio (RRR) ahead of any rate cut, which it had done during some of its past easing cycles, Warjiyo said the current liquidity condition is already loose, signalling he preferred to keep RRR rates unchanged.

4,PSX faces volatility amid political uncertainty,"KSE-100 index lost 810 points, or 1.3% WoW, settles at 63,002.92","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a tumultuous week marked by political uncertainty, a lack of positive triggers, and growing concerns on the political front, impacting investor sentiment. Challenges related to fiscal reforms, particularly in circular debt and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), also contributed to cautious investor behaviour ahead of the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) monetary policy announcement.
A significant event during the week was the SBP’s decision to maintain the benchmark policy rate at a record high of 22% for the fifth consecutive time over the past seven months. Additionally, the SBP reported a decline in foreign exchange reserves by $54 million to $8.2 billion for the week. Despite the volatility, some positive indicators emerged on the macroeconomic front. Robust earnings and export data provided a silver lining amidst the uncertainties.
The market started the week with a loss of over 1,000 points on Monday due to uncertainties regarding fiscal reforms and challenges faced by SOEs. Political and security concerns further dampened the market on the following day. However, the market rebounded on Wednesday, rising modestly by nearly 140 points despite the lack of encouraging triggers.
Bulls staged a comeback on Thursday, propelling the KSE-100 index up by over 400 points as investors welcomed the news that elections would proceed as scheduled despite political noise. The positive momentum continued on the next day, with the market adding another nearly 610 points following robust export data showing a year-on-year surge of 26.9% to $2.786 billion in January. However, despite these fluctuations, the benchmark KSE-100 index concluded the week with a loss of 810 points, or 1.3%, settling at 63,002.92.
JS Global analyst Shagufta Irshad noted a bumpy ride for the index, reporting a decline of 810 points on a week-on-week basis. Political developments took centre stage, with investors largely ignoring corporate announcements.
On the macroeconomic front, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation stood at 28.3% year-on-year for January 2024, with a month-on-month uptick of 2.9% in food inflation. The SBP’s decision to keep the Policy Rate unchanged at 22% aligned with market expectations, with hints of potential disinflation and softening interest rates going forward. The country’s primary balance for 1HFY24 exceeded the IMF’s proposed performance criteria of Rs1.42 trillion.

Forex reserves remained stable at $8.2 billion for the week, while the trade deficit for January 2024 increased by 7% month-on-month to $1.95 billion. Petrol prices saw an increase of Rs13.55 per litre, and diesel prices rose by Rs2.75 per litre due to an increase in ex-refinery prices.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that the market remained depressed during the week due to political noise and uncertainty related to circular debt resolution. The SBP’s decision to keep the benchmark policy rate unchanged and a decline in headline inflation for January 2024 contributed to market dynamics.
Despite a 4% year-on-year fall in petroleum sales and a 25% year-on-year reduction in the trade deficit for January 2024, the market closed at 63,003 points, losing 810 points, or -1.3% week-on-week.
Sectors contributing to the index’s strength included automobile assemblers, cable and electrical goods, insurance, and pharmaceuticals. Foreign selling continued at $9.7 million, with major selling observed in commercial banks and cement. On the local front, buying was reported by insurance companies and broker proprietary trading.
Key news during the week included a 13% fall in oil sales in July-Jan, foreign investors withdrawing $37 million in January, a government hike in petrol prices, a cut in development funds by Rs114 billion, and rice exports at 16-year high prices. AHL expects the market to remain range-bound in the upcoming week as investors closely monitor the General Elections on 8th Feb’24.

5,Special passes for Afg-Pak cargo transport,Smoothing of Pak-Afghan trade which recently halted for ten days over conditions of visas by truck drivers,"Coordinator Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, has suggested issuing special passes to truck drivers transporting cargo goods between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In a press statement released on Friday, Sarhadi said the suggestion is based on streamlining and smoothing of Pak-Afghan trade which recently halted for ten days over conditions of visas by truck drivers. Around 1000 truck drivers will be issued special passes instead of visas for carrying their goods with ease between Pakistan and Afghanistan, he added. He stressed that these trucks should be registered with Customs and Transport Departments in Pakistan and Transport and Gumrak in Afghanistan. The owners of heavy vehicles should also be charged a nominal fee for issuance of special pass, he added.

Sarhadi noted that hundreds of trucks got stuck on both sides of the border and businessmen faced hefty losses due to rotting of perishable items. The importers and exporters of both countries also have to pay enormous amounts as detention charges at a rate of US dollars 120 to 180 per day. He highlighted that the issuance of special passes to trucks, allowing them to ply between Karachi to Mazhar Sharif, will help in easing the transportation of cargo goods and promotion of trade between the two neighbouring countries.

7,Cotton production up 75%,"Favourable weather, govt support drive growth, but rising costs pose challenges","Pakistan’s cotton production has witnessed a 75% increase in the current season, reaching an impressive 8.35 million bales. This upturn has significantly bolstered the country’s largest export earner, the textile industry, and heightened its impact on overall economic activities.
Favourable weather conditions and the government’s announcement of a higher commodity support price at Rs8,500 per 40kg for the ongoing season have played pivotal roles in this unprecedented growth.
According to the Pakistan Cotton Ginner’s Association, the production, as reported on Saturday, stands at 4.76 million bales in the same period (Jul-Jan) of fiscal year 2022-23.
Breaking down the latest production data, the major boost in commodity output is attributed to Sindh, where harvesting increased by 120% to 4.11 million bales in the current season compared to the previous one. The rest of the production, totalling 4.24 million bales, came from Punjab, marking a 47% rise in the first seven months of the season compared to the same period last year. The PCGA estimates the full-season output to be in the range of 8-9 million bales this year, while Naseem Usman, Chairman of Karachi Cotton Brokers Forum, projects the total commodity production to reach 8.45 million bales by the end of the current season.

The government’s announcement of a minimum purchasing price of Rs8,500 per 40kg has led farmers to cultivate the commodity over a larger area of agricultural land, according to industry officials.
Ahsanul Haq, Chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginners’ Forum, noted that despite the stability in cotton prices internationally, local textile and spinning mills are facing challenges. The industry is grappling with the rising cost of production due to increased energy prices, prompting discussions of potential protests.
Textile mills are awaiting a reduction in electricity tariffs from 14 cents to 9 cents, while the government is considering another increase in gas prices under IMF instructions.

8,Auto industry anticipates sales boost post elections,"Stable prices, reduced interest rates forecasted to drive demand","Prices of automobiles are expected to stabilise, and a reduction in interest rates following the 2024 general elections is predicted to boost sales, according to forecasts from spare parts vendors and auto dealers.
“There is no hope for decreasing auto prices as inflation has hit around 30% this time, while the exchange rate has reached Rs280 and is now stable. Firstly, I hope auto prices will not go up in 2024 as the current account has already been balanced, and things are better on a macro level. Secondly, a 5% to 6% interest rate reduction is expected in the coming months. Falling interest rates will increase the demand for car leasing. Thirdly, pent-up demand for autos will rise again in the second half of this year (2024). If the current economic situation, following better initiatives of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, tax collection, and stability persist, and if there is some more FDI, the demand for auto sales will definitely gain momentum in 2024 and 2025,” Tecno Auto Glass Limited CEO Aamir Allawala told The Express Tribune.
He mentioned three factors that dented the demand for cars following frequent closures of production plants during 2023. Firstly, Pakistan underwent a current account deficit during 2021-2022, the State Bank of Pakistan imposed certain controls on foreign exchange, and restrictions were placed on opening Letters of Credit. Auto makers could not open their LCs and clear cargo lying at the port, resulting in a break in the supply chain. Completely Knocked Down parts were not available, and vendors were unable to import their raw materials. Secondly, the Pakistan foreign exchange rate shot up to Rs300 from Rs180, increasing the cost of auto due to a significant surge in prices, leading customers to avoid purchasing vehicles. Thirdly, the interest rate swelled to 22% from 10%, affecting the sale of cars on leasing.
Read Auto industry eyes 2024 recovery
Speaking about an uptrend in the auto sector, author and auto maven Murtaza Mandviwala, who is also a leading auto dealer, said institutional buying would pick up soon as the 2024 general poll would slow down sales temporarily, and the post-election scenario would see a rise in sales as car buyers expect less uncertainty.
Highlighting lacklustre auto sales recently and last year, he mentioned that an unusually high price increase resulted in postponing decision-making for buyers looking to replenish or upgrade models. Rising inflation, impacted motorcycle, used, and small car buyers, with monthly instalment payments rising in case of auto financing.
He mentioned high auto financing rates for all of motor vehicles, continued focus by the FBR on notices to individual car buyers, and the SBP capping auto financing, impacting sales. Moreover, the economic downturn affected the commercial vehicle segment used for the transport of people and goods, including trucks, buses, pickups, and vans.

9,Govt initiates FBR restructuring,"Akhtar to head implementation committee, 72 hours deadline for legal package","With less than a week before the general elections, the interim government has notified an implementation committee to execute the restructuring of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and has set a tight deadline of 72 hours to finalise a legal package.
Chairperson of the Pakistan Stock Exchange and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, Dr Shamshad Akhtar will head the implementation committee in her capacity as the finance minister. The first meeting of the committee was held on Saturday, immediately after the notification, during which the chairperson of the committee presented her plan for overhauling the tax machinery.
The Revenue Division has notified the eight-member Implementation and Asset Distribution Committee to give effect to the FBR’s restructuring. Two sub-committees have also been notified to prepare a slew of legal amendments in laws, finalise new statutes, and distribute the assets between the two new organisations. The sub-committee on the distribution of assets also met on Saturday.
Other members of the implementation committee include the Secretary of Law, private consulate Dr Musharraf Rasool Cyan, Dr Manzoor Ahmad, Member Administration FBR Nadeem Rizvi, Member Legal Customs Mukarram Jah Ansari, and Member Inland Revenue Policy Afaq Qureshi. Additional Secretary Revenue Division, Sajid Qazi, will act as the secretary to the implementation committee.
Three days ago, the federal cabinet approved the FBR’s restructuring. After the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar told The Express Tribune that the restructuring of FBR would be implemented by the next elected government, and the next Parliament would make requisite changes. However, immediately after approval, the Election Commission of Pakistan barred the prime minister from taking any action, terming it beyond his constitutional and legal mandate. According to the ECP, the caretaker Prime Minister should avoid major reforms in the FBR and keep it pending for consideration by the new government after the General Elections-2024. The committee notification indicates that the interim government will prepare plans within four to seven days, but no timeframe for submitting this plan to the federal cabinet has been given.
The approved restructuring involves the cessation of the FBR, leading to the creation of two new organisations and three new boards. Legislative changes, including enactments for Customs and Inland Revenue establishments, and alterations in respective rules and Rules of Business 1973, will be required for the restructuring’s implementation.

On the administration side, changes will be necessary regarding budget and expenditure allocations, establishment of new administrations, and division of existing assets between the two administrations. In place of the FBR, the Federal Custom Board and Federal Inland Revenue Board will be created and placed under the Revenue Division.
A government official stated that the Special Investment Facilitation Council supports the cabinet’s decision, but said legislative changes should be left to the new government. The implementation committee will only prepare drafts of amendments, shared with the next elected government.
The notification mentions that the finance minister will engage with the economic teams of all major political parties to create understanding and buy-in for the approved restructuring. According to the notification, the legal sub-committee will prepare a legal package for the restructuring’s implementation within four days. The package will include a statutory draft of new legislation, amendments in respective statutes, changes in rules of business of 1973, and other related rules and regulations.
The legal committee will also finalise the revised mandate of the Revenue Division, including the creation of a tax policy unit and the constitution of the tax policy board. The legal committee will conclude the establishment of the Federal Board of Customs and Federal Board of Inland Revenue within four days. Its mandate also includes proposals for the operationalisation of Customs Administration and Inland Revenue Administration within four days.
Once the legal plan is ready, it will be placed before the main implementation committee, which will have two days to give its approval. After approval, a one-day deadline is set for the Law Division to approve the legal package and prepare it for submission before the federal cabinet.
