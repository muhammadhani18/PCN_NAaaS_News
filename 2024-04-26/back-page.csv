0,"No tensions with Pakistan, insists US State Dept","“Pakistan continues to be one of our most important partners in the region,” says US State Dept Principal Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel.","WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: The US State Department emphatically declared on Thursday that there’s ‘absolutely no’ undercurrent of discord between the United States and Pakistan, despite recent sanctions imposed on companies allegedly supplying missile components to Islamabad.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office on Thursday dismissed the assessment of Pakistan’s human rights situation in the recently launched US State Department’s Human Rights Report as “unfair and politically motivated” and criticised it for lacking objectivity.
“Pakistan continues to be one of our most important partners in the region,” Principal Deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said, addressing concerns about potential tensions arising from the sanctions, during the daily news briefing.
Responding to queries, Patel said: “There continues to be a lot of cooperation that we have with the government of Pakistan, especially in the security space and trade sector.”

Foreign Office dismisses US report on human rights situation in Pakistan

He recalled that the Pakistani finance minister was in Washington last week and held consultations with members of the State Department. “This is a robust relationship, and we look to continue strengthening it,” he added.
Last week, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on three Chinese and one Belarusian companies for allegedly supplying dual-use components for Pakistan’s missile programme, a charge Islamabad rejected as incorrect.
However, on Tuesday, Patel clarified during his daily briefing that the sanctions were imposed because these entities were “proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery”.
He said that on October 23, the United States had also designated three Chinese entities for allegedly supplying components to Pakistan’s missile programme.
“We’re going to continue to disrupt and take actions against proliferation networks and concerning weapons of mass destruction procurement activities wherever they may occur,” he declared.
FO rejects US report
The 2023 US Human Rights Report on Pakistan underscored a concerning status quo in human rights violations, with no notable improvements. The report alleged a range of serious issues, including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrests and a lack of fair public trials, all indicative of a broader culture of impunity.
In its response on Thursday, the Foreign Office said: “The US State Department’s annual exercises of preparing such unsolicited reports lack objectivity and remain inherently flawed in their methodology. These reports use domestic social lens to judge human rights in other countries in a politically biased manner.”
The report alleges that government forces were frequently implicated in abuses, along with severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and media — manifested through censorship and violence against journalists.
The FO criticised the report for exhibiting double standards, arguing that such attitude undermined the discourse on international human rights.
“It is deeply concerning that a report purported to highlight human rights situations around the world ignores or downplays the most urgent hotspots of gross human rights violations such as in Gaza and Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir,” the FO stated, emphasising that only a report with political motivations could neglect the grave conditions in Gaza, including the weaponisation of humanitarian aid and the killing of over 33,000 civilians.

1,Asif rejects claim Imran ‘being forced to accept deal’,Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has rejected the PTI claim that former premier Imran Khan is being pressured to accept...,"Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has rejected the PTI claim that former premier Imran Khan is being pressured to accept a ‘deal’.
In an interview with Independent Urdu, Mr Asif said, “There is no truth in claims of pressuring Imran Khan to come to the negotiating table.
Speaking to reporters outside Parliament House the other day, Barrister Gohar had claimed that the way Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi were being treated in prison were attempts to pressure the PTI leader into accepting a deal.
“If there is any dialogue or communication, we will not hide it from you all […] Khan sahib himself said that there has been no contact with him [to strike a deal],” he added.
Rejecting the PTI chairman’s claim, Mr Asif told Independent Urdu that PTI was making such statements only to stay relevant. He added that “reputable people from the PTI had given statements that there was no deal taking place nor was there any contact” for it.
On relations between the PTI-led Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa government and the Centre, he said the federal government should not be the one to take the “initiative” of ruining the relations.
Mr Asif also expressed the hope that obstacles in the way of Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project will be removed and it will be completed.
Talking to Geo News, he maintained that regional stakeholders must gather on one platform to protect their interests and termed the “successful visit” of Iranian Presi­dent Ebrahim Raisi to Pakis­tan a “great development”.

CAIRO: As Israel stepped up airstrikes on Rafah and planned to launch an all-out ground assault despite allies’ warnings this could cause mass casualties, Pales­tinian authorities on Thursday asked the United Nations to conduct a probe into mass graves at Gaza hospitals.
Medics in the besieged Palestinian enclave reported five Israeli airstrikes on Rafah early on Thursday that hit at least three houses, killing at least six people including a local journalist.
In the seventh month of a devastating air and ground war against Hamas, Israeli forces also resumed bombarding northern and central areas of the Gaza Strip, as well as east of Khan Yunis in the south.
Israeli warplanes had hammered the north for a second day on Wednesday, shattering weeks of comparative calm there.

Palestinian authorities seek UN probe into mass graves at Gaza hospitals

The war, now in its seventh month, has killed at least 34,305 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities said on Thursday.
In the north, Israeli forces continued to pound Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun, Jabalia and Zeitoun, with some residents saying Hamas and Islamic Jihad were fighting Israeli ground forces with anti-tank rockets, mortar bombs and sniper fire.
Meanwhile, a Palestinian civil defence team on Thursday called on the United Nations to investigate what it said were war crimes at a Gaza hospital, saying nearly 400 bodies were recovered from mass graves after Israeli soldiers departed the complex.
“There are cases of field execution of some patients while undergoing surgeries and wearing surgical gowns at the Nasser Medical Complex,” the civil defence forces said at a press conference.
