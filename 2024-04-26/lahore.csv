A two-member bench headed by Justice Anwarul Haq Pannun heard a petition by Faraz Iqbal and Imaan Iqbal, the son and the daughter of Ms Shahzadi, challenging the inclusion of their name in the exit control list (ECL).
Advocate Azhar Siddique appeared on behalf of the petitioners and argued that the government subjected his clients to political victimisation. He said the petitioners were not required in any case by any government agency. He said the petitioners were not being allowed to go abroad for performing Umrah and education purposes as they had been placed on the ECL.
A government lawyer stated that no property was yet registered in the petitioners’ names, but inquiries were underway against their mother, who is out of the country.
Justice Pannun questioned how the children can be prevented from leaving the country on the basis of some inquiries pending against their parents, saying they were free and independent.
The bench allowed the petition and permitted the petitioners to travel abroad with a direction to the government to remove their names from the ECL.
Multiple inquiries of alleged corruption were launched against the housing business of Farhat Shahzadi and her husband by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Anti Corruption Establishment (ACE). However, she had left the country before the start of the inquiries.

“When a 76-year-old Swati is not making any deals, neither will the PTI founder,” he maintained.
The PTI leader emphasised that all institutions and their people were respectable.

2,Minister backs call for probe into wheat import by caretakers,Speaker says small growers can’t be left at the mercy of middlemen,"LAHORE: Punjab Food Minister Bilal Yasin has supported the call for setting up a committee to investigate import of wheat by the caretaker government as the house unanimously rejected the current wheat procurement policy.
Concluding the discussion on wheat procurement policy in the Punjab Assembly on Thursday, he negated the impression that the government does not want to buy wheat.
“In fact, the change in weather is one of the reasons behind the delay in the start of the wheat procurement drive.”
He said the decision to import wheat had been taken by the caretaker government and not the Punjab food department and the move should be investigated as it has created problems for the purchase of new crop.

Speaker says small growers can’t be left at the mercy of middlemen

He assured the MPAs that the suggestions made during the discussion would be made part of the new wheat procurement policy as growers would not be left alone.
He lauded the opposition for making positive suggestions on the matter.
Earlier, members across the aisle in assembly rejected the government’s policy of purchasing wheat only from farmers owning land up to six acres.
Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan also put his weight behind the MPAs saying the wheat growers owning more six acres of land could not be left at the mercy of market forces.
Opposition MPA Rana Shehbaz wondered how 3.5 million tonnes of grain were imported against the policy decision of importing only 2.2mt wheat.
Brig retired Mushtaq lamented that suggestions were being sought at a time when the crop must have been procured.
Mian Ijaz Shafi said that half of the wheat has been harvested, while the procurement drive has not started.
Treasury MPA Jafar Ali Hocha said that middlemen and not the growers were applying for gunny bags through the Bardana App developed for the purpose.
He warned that if the wheat grower was ignored this time, the whole province would suffer as the farming community would turn to other crops.
Former speaker Rana Muhammad Iqbal lamented that the minister was not coming up with a clear wheat policy.
Roy Muhammad Ali suggested allocating funds for stocking wheat so that the growers get relief in the next year.
Arif Mehmood Gul and Chaudhry Javed called for an agricultural emergency to save the financial backbone of the country.

6,JI for timely completion of Pak-Iran gas project,New emir wants to pursue rigging issue before SC,"LAHORE: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Thursday put its weight behind the ‘timely’ completion of the Pakistan-Iran Gas Pipeline project and cautioned the United States against meddling in Pakistan’s internal affairs.
This wish and warning came in maiden “Meet the Press” by newly-elected emir Naeemur Rehman here at party’s Mansoora headquarters.
Narrating the significance of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s visit to Pakistan, he stressed the need for swift action and implementation of agreements signed between the two neighbouring nations.
Addressing the media, Rehman declared that the JI would pursue the issue of ‘extensive’ election rigging before the Supreme Court, urging the chief justice to recognise it as an unprecedented violation of the basic democratic rights of the people.

New emir wants to pursue rigging issue before SC

The JI would never recognise the governments formed by PML-N, PPP, and MQM on ‘fraudulent’ mandates and would take its case to the top court based on evidence of electoral fraud in Karachi, representing the entire nation of Pakistan.
Reiterating their readiness to collaborate with political parties that share their stance on electoral integrity, he highlighted the impossibility of sustaining a system built on deceitful mandates, leading everyone to a dead end.
The JI, he said, would not engage in electoral alliances with any party but rather align with the people of Pakistan.
He also called for a resolution to the issue of missing persons, emphasising the necessity of subjecting any lawbreakers to due legal process.
Rehman highlighted the need for the reforms in the electoral process, particularly the adoption of electronic voting machines. He advocated for proportional representation to strengthen democracy and dismantle the dominance of traditional power brokers like electables, feudal lords, and other ruling elites.
The JI chief emphasised the urgent need to reassess agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), labelling these contracts as flawed and detrimental to the interests of the people, especially in terms of expensive electricity.
He announced the expansion of the “Bano Qabil” initiative nationwide, with plans to include one million youth in the near future. Addressing the issue of education, he pledged the JI’s commitment to advocating for a uniform education system at all levels.
Highlighting the grievances of the youth and the plight of women under the current governance, particularly in the workforce, he expressed the JI’s readiness to be a voice for both groups, inviting them to join the JI platform.
Rehman rejected trade ties with India until a resolution to the Kashmir issue aligning with the desires of Kashmiri people is achieved. He affirmed the JI’s solidarity with the people of Gaza, honouring their resistance against Israeli occupation. Commending the activism of students in western universities in support of Palestine, he called upon Pakistani students to similarly raise awareness about the Palestinian cause in their universities.

The government has also suspended three senior officials of the buildings department, including the executive engineer Abdul Rauf, sub divisional officer (SDO) Fawad Meuneer and a sub-engineer Sartaash Ahmed, in the light of an initial inquiry into the incident, in which a 60-year-old woman patient had died and at least a dozen others were injured.
The provincial government’s project of revamping the ABSTH had been underway for the last few months and the contractor had removed the pillars supporting the roofs to fix the windows, resulting in bending of the concrete slabs of the roofs of ground and first floors.
The Punjab health minister Khawaja Salman Rafique and communication and works minister Sohaib Bharth, along with the provincial secretaries concerned, had visited the hospital, inspecting the site of the incident.
However, sources in the local buildings department say that the SDO, who was in charge of the project execution, had written at least two letters, between December 2023 and March 2024, to the MS of the hospital, warning him of the possible damage to the building’s structure due to the weight of concrete blocks placed on the rooftop for the installation of solar panels.
However, the sources say, these letters had never been responded by the hospital administration.
Sources in the local administration told Dawn a detailed inquiry would be launched soon into the matter to fix responsibility for the incident.
