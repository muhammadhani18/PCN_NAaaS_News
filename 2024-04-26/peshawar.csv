0,BRT fare to go up as govt plans to halve Rs6 billion subsidy: CM aide,Aslam claims KP has ‘really good’ balance sheet,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa adviser to chief minister on finance Muzzammil Aslam said Thursday the provincial government was working to bring down subsidy for the Peshawar Bus Rapid Transit from Rs6 billion to Rs3 billion.
“We want to save Rs2 billion by curtailing expenditure and Rs1 billion by increasing bus fare by Rs5-Rs10,” Mr Aslam told reporters at the finance department here.
He said if the bus service was privatised, then the fare would jump to Rs80 per person.
The aide to the CM said the provincial government has taken up the province’s financial issues with the federal government.

Aslam claims KP has ‘really good’ balance sheet

“We have written seven to eight letters to the federal government about 12 of our issues with it and will continue raising our voice for our rights,” he said.
Mr Aslam said the efforts of the provincial government had increased the province’s share in oil and gas royalty from Rs12 billion to Rs14 billion.
“After the reconciliation of books, our share of oil and gas royalty has gone up by Rs2 billion. The province is likely to receive the amount next month,” he said.
The CM’s adviser said that the government’s three-pronged strategy was revenue increase, expenditure reduction, and resource mobilisation.
He said the province was mulling over setting up a mine and mineral company.
“Our government will have 30 per cent share of the leases. We can earn up to Rs7 billion from the mineral sector per annum,” he said.
Mr Aslam also said that the province was also striving to strengthen its Oil and Gas Development Company.
He also said that the province’s forest potential stood at around Rs200 billion.
“We have the same forest cover as Austria’s,” he said, adding that the province’s forest cover has gone up to 26 per cent due to interventions like the Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation programme.
The aide to the CM said that the province’s forestry sector had the potential to generate Rs200 billion in revenues through scientific forest management.
He said that the reports about the province’s being overburdened with the debt were overplayed as its debt-to-GDP ratio was around seven per cent.
Mr Aslam said that currently, the province’s liabilities stood at about $2.3 billion, while its GDP had been estimated to be around $35 billion.
He added that major chunks of foreign remittances totalling about $12 billion were destined for the province. “We have a really good balance sheet,” he said.
The CM’s adviser He said that international partners at the recent donors conference in the provincial capital made pledges amounting to $1.8 billion, which was a huge success for the provincial government.
Mr Aslam said the KP government would purchase 300,000 tonnes of wheat from open market at a cost of Rs28 billion.
He added that the government had also released over Rs7.5 billion for the Sehat Card Plus scheme in the last few weeks.
The CM’s adviser said that the provincial government provided people with subsidies on essential goods last Ramazan on the basis of the data from the Benazir Income Support Programme but didn’t publicise it.
He said that the government was committed to revenue generation.
Mr Aslam said the province wanted to reduce its share of property taxes from six per cent to three per cent.

2,Jirga opposes military operation in Lakki Marwat,Tens of thousands of people gather on call of Marwat Qaumi Jirga in Tajazak.," 

— Dawn

LAKKI MARWAT: A grand peace jirga has asked the government to refrain from launching a general operation against a handful of militants in the district as it can cause mass exodus of around one million locals.
On the call of Marwat Qaumi Jirga (MQJ), tens of thousands of people participated in the gathering held in Tajazai on Thursday. Traders kept their shutters down and attended the meeting to express solidarity with Marwat Qaumi Jirga.
The participants of the jirga said that there was no official word about any plan to launch a large-scale operation against militants in the district. However, they said a fear persisted among people regarding launch of a grand general operation against militants. They said that that any such action to eliminate a handful of militants would not be a wise step.
 
 

They said that locals always cooperated with police and security forces and they had no objection to intelligence-based operations. Along with national flags the participants also waved white flags as a symbol of peace.
Addressing the jirga, PTI leader and former district nazim Ishfaq Meenakhel said that Marwat and other tribes living in the district were peace loving and there was no justification to launch an operation. “Under any circumstance, the elders cannot allow law enforcers to launch an operation that can cause mass departure of locals to other areas,” he added.
Former federal minister Salim Saifullah Khan said that the army was strong with undaunted support of people and any operation against militants without the support of locals would not bear desired results.
He stressed the need for building trust between government and people and said that locals were poor and displacement would add to their miseries. He asked government to resolve people’s problems and take practical steps for their uplift.
“A general operation can be launched on our dead bodies as elders will be in the frontline to protect the lives and properties of Marwat and people from other tribes,” said former federal secretary and supreme commander of Marwat Qaumi Jirga.
He lauded police and other law enforcement agencies for their sacrifices in the war against terrorism.
MNA Naseer Mohammad Khan, Maulana Asghar Ali, Haji Ameer Nawaz Khan, Shafiullah Khan, Zeeshan Mohammad Khan, Nasir Kamal Marwat, Malik Mohammad Riaz Khan, Advocate Farman, Fazal Rahim Khan, Asif Iqbal, Maulana Samiullah Mujahid, MPA Johar Mohammad Khan, Pir Fawad Zakori, MPA Tariq Saeed Khan, Maulana Anwar Badshah, Waheed Aslam Khan and Latifullah Khan also addressed the jirga.
They asked the government to increase number of police and equip them with modern weapons and gadgets. They also demanded resumption of night patrolling by police and a crackdown on drug peddlers, gamblers and land grabbers.
They also asked the government to vacate the government educational institutions from security forces.

3,"Railways employees seek 100pc increase in salary, pension","PESHAWAR: The members of Pakistan Railways Employees Union have demanded of government to increase their salaries,...","PESHAWAR: The members of Pakistan Railways Employees Union have demanded of government to increase their salaries, medical allowance and pension by 100 per cent in the next budget.
Addressing a news conference at Peshawar Press Club on Thursday, central president of union Sheikh Mohammad Anwar said that the practice of hiring contract officers and consultants against heavy salaries should be banned.
He said that the Pakistan Railways was a national organisation, which had become a hub of problems, as neither its workers were happy nor people and government were satisfied with its performance.
Flanked by other office-bearers of the union, Sheikh Anwar said that the main reason of the deterioration of services of railways was political interference and poor policies of administration.
“It is suffering from financial crisis and different kinds of challenges. The problems are not new,” he said. He added that successive governments never took serious initiatives to improve railways despite the fact it was a part of the country’s defence, welfare and unity of the country.
Sheikh Anwar said that government was reluctant to fill the vacant posts of different categories mainly after the retirement of employees. He said that ban was imposed on recruitments while posts were being eliminated in the name of rationalisation that caused various problems.
He said that their salaries and pensions should be taken over by the ministry of finance like other federal institutions to ensure timely payment. He also asked for payment of the medical bills, timely pension and gratuity to employees of railways.
The union leader demanded of the government to approve a bailout package of Rs25 billion for rehabilitation of railways. He also asked for restoration of different trains including Khushhal Khan Khattak Express, Bulleh Shah Express, Pakpattan Express, Akbar Bugti Express, Shah Hussain Express and others to overcome the existing problems.
Sheikh Anwar said that allowances should be given to all technical employees of the engineering department without discrimination and all diploma holder sub-engineers should be upgraded to BPS-14 instead of BPS-11 on pattern of other institutions.

4,Issues crop up only when institutions overstep constitutional roles: KP Assembly speaker,Babar Swati says govt will call session for swearing-in of members.,"PESHAWAR: Speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Babar Saleem Swati on Thursday said that problems cropped up only when institutions overstepped their constitutional roles.
“State institutions are powerful. They are not the state, but just part of it,” Mr Swati told reporters in the assembly here.
He said legislators acted as a buffer between the security establishment and the people.
He said people were filmed and stripped naked for challenging the powers-that-be.
“This is a bitter reality,” he said.
 
 

The speaker said the session for the swearing-in of the members elected to reserved seats had to be called by the provincial government.
“The day the house is called, they [women and non-Muslim members elected to reserved seats] will take oath and sign the roll of members, but it is the government to call that session,” he said.
Mr Swati said that he received a letter from the provincial governor about the session for administering oaths to those reserved seats and responded to it after getting the advice of the law department.
He also said that the government filed the reply after getting the high court’s orders about the oath-taking session and assured it that all its orders would be implemented “if applicable.”
The speaker said the country got the Constitution but continued to have the pre-Partition laws.
He flayed media restrictions on detained former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan.
In a statement issued by his office afterwards, the speaker said that the media’s role was very important in any democratic state.
“A country becomes an ideal place to live if the media plays an active role in a positive manner,” he said.
Mr Swati directed officials of the assembly secretariat to address the issues of parliamentary reporters.
He issued directions to them on Wednesday as well, ensuring that journalists attend meetings of the public accounts committee to let people know about the revenue’s sources and utilisation.
The assembly session for the swearing-in of new members is a bone of contention between the government and the opposition.
A legal battle between them began after the government refused to follow the governor’s orders to call a sitting for administering oaths to women and non-Muslims elected to reserved seats.
It declared those orders against the Constitution as well as the rules and refused to follow them, prompting the opposition members to demonstrate and start a legal battle.
Ahead of the April 2 Senate elections, the Peshawar High Court directed Mr Swati to administer oaths to the provincial assembly’s members elected to reserved seats to ensure their participation in the forthcoming electoral exercise.

A ceremony was organised as part of the tree plantation campaign to mitigate the effects of climate change in Malam Jabba. Officials of military and civil administration, forest department, local elders and representatives of Samsons Group including Dr Wasifur Rehman, Brig Sajid Akbar, ADC Mohammad Suhail, and Wahidullah attended the ceremony.
Speaking on the occasion, they said that current climate models indicated a rise in temperatures intensifying the earth’s water cycle. It led to increased evaporation, they added.
This phenomenon is expected to result in more frequent and intense storms besides drying in some land areas. Consequently, regions affected by storms may experience heightened precipitation and an increased risk of flooding. The areas away from storm tracks may face reduced precipitation and an elevated risk of drought.
They said that global challenges posed by climate change were evident in the irregular yet frequent rainfall patterns observed worldwide. They said that extensive plantation was vital to address the issue.
The speakers lauded Samsons Group for its commitment to combat climate change by expanding forest cover through tree plantation initiatives in the area. They urged all participants to take active part in planting trees to contribute to the success of efforts aimed at mitigating climate challenges.
The participants of the ceremony including local elders and students planted trees in Malam Jabba.

9,PHC asks govt about delay in information commissioners’ appointment,Petition seeks early filling of two vacancies,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has asked the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary to inform it about the reason(s) for a long delay in the appointment of two information commissioners in the province under the law on right to information.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal fixed April 30 for the next hearing into a petition filed by former information commissioner of Punjab Mukhtar Ahmad Ali for the speedy process to fill the two vacancies.
It directed assistant advocate general Bilal Khan, who represented the provincial government, to get information from the chief secretary about the appointment of the members and information commissioner of the Right to Information Commission and produce it on the next hearing.
The petitioner, who is the executive director of the Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI), has sought the court’s orders for the government to expedite the appointment of those information commissioners in accordance with Section 24(4) of the KP Right to Information Act, 2013.

Petition seeks early filling of two vacancies

He requested the bench to declare the failure to appoint the information commissioners and the resulting incomplete status of the KP Information Commission a breach of the statutory duty on part of authorities and a violation of the KPRTI Act and Article 19-A of the Constitution.
The lone respondent in the petition is the KP government through its chief secretary.
The petitioner appeared in person and said that for over 20 years, he had been actively advocating for people’s right to information.
He contended that the right to information had been people’s fundamental right since 2010 when Article 19-A was inserted in the Constitution, providing every citizen with the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law.
The petitioner said the KP RTI Act was notified on Nov 5, 2013, while the KP Information Commission was established in 2013.
He said the provincial government had appointed Farah Hamid Khan as the chief information commissioner on July 15, 2022.
Mr Mukhtar said that the posts of two information commissioners had been lying vacant since Nov 18, 2019, and July 14, 2022.
Referring to different provisions of the law, the petitioner said that the right to information commission was designated as the key entity responsible for adjudicating on matters related to people’s right to access information held by public bodies.
He pointed out that through multiple letters and public statements, he had repeatedly urged the KP government and other senior office holders to appoint the two information commissioners, but in vain.
The petitioner contended that the failure of authorities to appoint two members led to an incomplete information commission in the province.
He added that that deficiency had led to the backlog of 1567 complaints filed by people against public bodies, as per the data that was available on the website of the commission on Feb 19, 2024.
The petitioner said the current state of the information commission amid vacancies and pending complaints stopped people from exercising their constitutional rights.

SP (investigation) Jamilur Rehman told a news conference here that after receiving people’s complaints about motorcycle thefts, the police recovered five motorcycles from Mohammad Shoaib, Ahzaz Ali, and Zeeshan.
He said four accomplices of the detainees fled, and the police were searching for them.
INAUGURATED: District and sessions judge Shahnaz Hameed Khattak inaugurated the “Copies Branch” at the tehsil judicial complex in Ghazi here on Thursday.
She told participants that the branch was opened to enable litigants to collect digitally scanned copies of their applications on the premises of the judicial complex.
The judge said Ghazi was the only tehsil to have the “Copies Branch” to save the time and money of litigants.
She said the facility of statement recording by witnesses via video link was already available to people in Ghazi. “Witnesses can record statements with the court not only from anywhere in the country but abroad, too,” she said.
About the expansion of the judicial complex, the judge said the required piece of land had been acquired and the construction would begin after the provision of funds.
She also said the establishment of the record room (muhafiz khana) in the tehsil was under consideration. “On the directives of the superior courts, efforts are afoot to ensure the provision of all possible facilities to visitors to the judicial complex to further the cause of justice,” she said.

The directions were issued by a bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal during the hearing into the petition of Mr Gandapur for the issuance of orders to the Federal Investigation Agency, police, National Accountability Bureau, and ACE to produce details of cases against him.
In the last hearing on Feb 27, the court provided interim relief to the petitioner by stopping police and other agencies from arresting him in any of the cases until further orders.
Law-enforcement agencies other than the ACE have already provided information about those cases to the court.
Advocate general Shah Faisal Uthmankhel appeared for the provincial government, whereas the petitioner was represented by lawyers Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah and Arshid Ali.
Assistant attorney general Danyal Khan, additional director legal of the FIA Abdur Rehman Afridi, and a NAB prosecutor also appeared before the court in the case.
Lawyers for the petitioner said Mr Gandapur was a law-abiding citizen and the chief minister of the province.
They said while the petitioner was aware of some of the cases in which he was granted protective bail by the high court, there might be several other cases about which he had no information from the government.
The counsel said they would approach the relevant courts for relief after learning about the cases.
They contended that under Article 19-A of the Constitution, which guaranteed access to information, it was the right of the petitioner to get information about the cases registered against him or any inquiry started against him by any of the law-enforcement agencies.
The advocate general said there were six cases registered against the petitioner in Dera Ismail Khan, while the challan (final charge sheet) had already been submitted to the relevant courts in those cases.
The FIA’s representative said there were only two inquiries against the petitioner in Dera Ismail Khan.
The NAB prosecutor insisted that, presently, a single inquiry was under way against the petitioner.
After learning that the ACE had so far not provided the relevant details, the bench wondered if government agencies were acting in such a manner towards the chief minister, then what their attitude would be towards the common man.
The AG informed the bench that a high-level meeting was called for April 29 to decide about the cases registered after May 9 protests on political grounds.
Justice Shakeel Ahmad observed that instead of “pulling each other’s legs,” political parties should work together to serve people’s interests.
He added that he had seen video footage of a father selling his four children because of poverty.
The judge wondered in which direction the country was heading as the people suffered, but political forces, instead of addressing people’s issues, were busy in a power struggle.
The bench observed that it was the need of the hour that the political forces should jointly address those pressing issues.
The AG said that the government didn’t believe in the politics of revenge.
He added that the provincial chief minister, during a meeting with the prime minister, made it clear that he was ready to cooperate with the federal government in resolving people’s problems.

They came to Dodial Bazaar from Dodial and Shinkiari areas and demanded measures for their development.
“We struggle to have meals amid record inflation just because the district social welfare department and NGOs don’t support us despite receiving funds for our welfare,” Mohammad Iqbal told protesters.
Mr Iqbal said the government should ensure the provision of monthly financial assistance to PWDs under the BISP like other deserving people.
“We repeatedly approached the BISP high-ups in Mansehra for the registration of our women family members for assistance, but to no avail,” he said.
Another person with disability, Mohammad Shahzad, said in the past, the district social welfare department, through NGOs used to give away wheelchairs, medicines, and other essential goods to him and others like him, but that was no longer the case.
“We are all registered with the DSWD, but even then, we don’t have access to the benefits allowed to people like us in other provinces,” he said.
He said some local NGOs collected the data of PWDs and received donations for the welfare of those people, but didn’t utilise the money for that purpose.
Other PWDs Gareeb Jan, Mohammad Farooq, Anwar Shah and Mohammad Waqas demanded the chief minister’s intervention for their welfare.
Meanwhile, deputy commissioner of Lower Kohistan district Bashir Ahmad on Thursday visited an examination centre at the Government High School, Pattan.
He directed invigilators to check cheating and said irrelevant people shouldn’t be allowed to get close to examination centres.
Mr Ahmad said those challenging the writ of government should be brought to justice.
Later in the day, he gave away certificates to civil defence volunteers for their services rendered during natural calamities in the district.
