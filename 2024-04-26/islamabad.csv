0,IHC stays notification slashing Roti price,Judge says order issued in violation of legal framework,"ISLAMABAD: In response to a petition lodged by the naanbai association of the federal capital, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued a stay on a notification by the capital administration that reduced the price of Roti and Naan in Islamabad.
IHC Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri suspended the notification issued by the district administration of Islamabad that cut the price of Roti from Rs20 to Rs16 and Naan from Rs25 to Rs20. He was hearing the petition filed by Sajjad Ali, president of the Naanbais Welfare Association.
Petitioner’s counsel Barrister Umar Ijaz Gillani adopted before the court that under the law the controller general of prices and supplies of the finance ministry was empowered to issue a notification regarding the increase or decrease in the prices of eatables.
He said that the government was required to appoint the controller general prices and the appointment of assistant controllers was required to be made by the authorised officer for fixation of the rates.

Judge says order issued in violation of legal framework

He, however, this notification was issued by the deputy commissioner without any legal backing. He argued that the deputy commissioner fixed the rates in accordance with the prices set by the Punjab government. He said the price of flour in Islamabad was higher compared to the province.
The district administration representative informed the judge that the law had been amended and the deputy commissioner was empowered to issue such notification as per the law. Justice Jahangiri issued a stay order in this matter and sought a detailed reply from the government by May 6.
As per the details, the Punjab government issued a notification slashing the price of Roti, followed by a similar notification by the ICT administration. The Islamabad administration’s notification had set the price of Roti and Naan at Rs16 and Rs20, respectively.
Following the price cut, the deputy commissioner directed all the assistant commissioners and magistrates to intensify their efforts to enforce the government rates of Roti/Naan for a standard serving size of 120 grams in the federal capital.
In line with these directives, the assistant commissioners imposed a fine of Rs3,000 on each tandoor for violation of the new rates.
However, the naanbais challenged the decision through an association comprising over 3,000 tandoors in Islamabad. During the last hearing, Barrister Gilani submitted that no subsidy mechanism had been implemented in the matter in line with flour prices. In the current scenario, more than 3,000 tandoors in the capital territory are facing financial loss due to a cut in reasonable profit.
The counsel further contended that without legal authority, the district magistrate issued the notification on April 15, 2024, while exercising powers under Section 3 of the Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977. He pointed out that Section 3 of the act only authorised the federal government to issue such a notification. Barrister Gilani urged the court to set aside the notification because an “incompetent authority” had issued this order.

1,"Passenger killed, driver injured as robbers attack Lahore-bound bus near Kahuta","Police will soon trace and arrest the culprits who seemed to be local people, says SSP Hafiz Kamran Asghar.","RAWALPINDI: Four armed men attacked a Lahore-bound coaster near Kahuta killing a passenger and injuring the driver on Thursday.
Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations) Hafiz Kamran Asghar said blood samples of an injured robber and other evidence had been collected from the crime scene, adding the police will soon trace and arrest the culprits who seemed to be local people.
The SSP identified the deceased as Mohammad Farooq, a private employee in Lahore, and the injured driver as Akhtar Khan.
He said the robbers fired gunshots to rescue their accomplice who had been overpowered by one of the passengers. Unfortunately, the passenger lost his life in the incident, he said.
Shahid Mehmood, a resident of Azad Kashmir, lodged an FIR with the Kahuta police, stating that he worked as helper with the passenger coaster.
He said the coaster had left AJK for Lahore at 4pm on Wednesday. As it was ascending the Kallar Road near Kahuta, the driver found the road blocked with heavy stones.
He said as the driver slowed down, four young men carrying weapons surrounded the bus and one of them entered the vehicle and threatened the passengers to give up cash and valuables. He said the robber snatched his mobile phone and Rs60,000 from the driver.
As the gunman moved towards the passengers and started snatching their phones and cash, one of the passengers identified as Mohammad Farooq attempted to overpower him, which led to a scuffle between them.
Observing that their accomplice was in trouble, the robbers waiting outside the coaster opened fire which resulted in injuries to driver Akhtar Khan and Mohammad Farooq. Despite being injured, the driver sped off the bus; however the gunman who had boarded the vehicle jumped out and escaped.
He said after covering some distance, the driver could not continue driving and he (helper) took control of the vehicle and drove it to a nearby hospital.
However, Farooq, who was shot and injured, died in the bus whereas the driver was shifted to Rawalpindi by Rescue 1122.
After the incident was reported to the police, SSP operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar and other officials reached the crime scene and recorded the statements of the victims.
A police team led by DSP Kahuta has been formed to arrest the culprits.
Later, SP CIA Binish Fatima also visited the crime scene along with other officials.

2,LHC Rawalpindi bench rules against constructions in public parks,Says entertainment is a fundamental right and such encroachments infringe on people’s recreational activities.,"ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgement, Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawalpindi bench has ruled against constructions in public parks observing that entertainment is a fundamental right and such encroachments infringe on people’s recreational activities.
Justice Jawad Hassan issued the judgement while disposing of a petition filed against illegal constructions inside a children park in Rawalpindi.
The court cited Article 26 of the Constitution that guarantees that there must be no discrimination against any citizen regardless of race, sex, caste, religion or place of birth to access places of public entertainment or resort.
 
 

The judge defined the term ‘Entertainment’ reported in the case “Parks Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd v. director Excise and Taxation and others”, according to which “Entertainment means amusement, recreation or pastime. Amusement means anything that diverts the mind and pleases the mind. Recreation has the meaning of refreshment of the strength and spirits after toil and diversion while pastime connotes to pastime agreeably and in a pleasant manner.”
Justice Hassan observed that “failure to provide such basic necessary facilities is not only violative of Article 26 of the Constitution, which deals with the issue of access to places of public entertainment or resort which include a place to rest and take leisure and place for food and prayers.
It is also a clear violation of Articles 9, 14, 15, 20 and 38 of the Constitution which speaks about fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan such as right to life and liberty (Article 9), right to dignity (Article 14), right to freedom of movement (Article 15), right to food (Article 38), right to water (Article 9) and right to practice and propagate one’s religion (Article 20).“
The matter was pending since 2015 regarding construction carried out in the park reserved for children.
On Jan 25, 2022, LHC had observed that it was the fundamental right of the petitioners to have access to places of public entertainment or resort as guaranteed under Article 9 read with Article 26 of the Constitution.
The counsel for Punjab Housing and Town Planning Agency submitted a report and parawise comments and clarified that the park was being restored to its original condition for which administrative approval had also been obtained from the concerned authority.
He said a meeting of the competent authority was also held on Dec 14, 2023, regarding execution of work in the park for improvement of necessary facilities in order to further strengthen the right of petitioners as well as other inhabitants residing in surrounding area of the park.
Justice Jawad Hassan noted that aforementioned comments clearly depicted that developments at the spot were intended for improvement of the park in question in a bid to accomplish the plan initiated by the government of Punjab under umbrella of duly approved scheme.

3,Floods pour cold water over Pakistan’s dream to become ‘malaria-free’,Official says country to get rid of mosquito-borne disease by 2035.,"ISLAMABAD: While World Malaria Day was observed under a global theme, “Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world” on Thursday, Pakistan has committed to controlling the mosquito-borne disease, hoping to “become malaria-free by 2035”.
Once, Pakistan was eying the status of a malaria-free country but now it seems the goal may not be achieved in the near future. Health Ministry’s Special Secretary Syed Waqarul Hassan said that the lingering public health challenge posed by malaria was exacerbated by the 2022 floods.
He was speaking to participants of an event organised by the health ministry in collaboration with the Common Management Unit (CMU) for AIDS, TB and Malaria, in partnership with the World Health Organisation (WHO). Mr Hassan called for a united effort from all stakeholders, including policymakers, civil society organisations, UN agencies, NGOs, communities, and healthcare providers.
 
 

CMU National Coordinator Dr Razia Kaniz Fatima said that the CMU, in collaboration with the provincial programmes and with the support of the Global Fund (GF) and partnership with the Indus Hospital and Health Network (IHHN), was providing free of cost malaria prevention, diagnostic and treatment interventions through more than 5,500 public and private healthcare facilities in remote areas of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh.

Official says country to get rid of mosquito-borne disease by 2035

“With the GF support, about 11.1 million suspects were tested for malaria, and 2.6 million confirmed cases were successfully treated during last year. Further, 6.1 million insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) were distributed in 20 high-burden districts,” she said.
Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO representative to Pakistan, reaffirmed WHO’s commitment to combat malaria and support initiatives for a malaria-free Pakistan. He lauded the accelerated response of national and provincial programmes to combating malaria outbreaks during floods while presenting an animated video providing a historical overview of the malaria situation.
Dr Shahzad Ali Khan, vice chancellor of the Health Services Academy, emphasised the profound impact of malaria on individuals, families, and communities, urging heightened political and social commitment to alleviate its burden. He commended the efforts of healthcare workers, researchers, policymakers and communities worldwide in the fight against malaria.
It is worth mentioning that in 2022, because of floods, Pakistan reported 3.4 million cases of malaria. An official of the health ministry, requesting anonymity, said Pakistan had contacted the WHO in 2020 to start the process of declaring Punjab malaria-free but the move could not be implemented due to Covid-19 and a change of management in the malaria control wing.
The floods during the last three years, however, have made it difficult to turn this dream into reality, he added.
“…the health ministry claims that as per the national malaria strategy, Punjab, AJK, GB and ICT [Islamabad Capital Territory] will be declared malaria-free by 2025, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan will reduce their malaria incidence(s) up to 70pc till 2030, and Pakistan will be malaria-free till 2035,” he said.
According to details, at least 42 countries or territories have reached the malaria-free milestone. Last year WHO certified Azerbaijan and Tajikistan for achieving elimination of malaria in their territories. The certification followed a sustained, century-long effort to stamp out the disease by the two countries.
Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. The certification is granted when a country has shown – with rigorous, credible evidence – that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three consecutive years. A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission.

4,Thai monks pay homage to Buddha statues in Taxila,TAXILA: A 16 member delegation of tourists from Thailand led by monk Phra Pisit of Hinayan thought of Buddhism pay...,"TAXILA: A 16 member delegation of tourists from Thailand led by monk Phra Pisit of Hinayan thought of Buddhism pay homage to giant Buddha statues during their visit to Taxila Museum on Thursday.
The delegation expressed admiration for the impressive collection at Taxila Museum and lauded the dedicated efforts of the Directorate General of Archaeology, Punjab, in preserving the rich cultural heritage.
Upon arrival, the delegation was received by the curator of the Taxila Museum Humera Naz, who also briefed them about various artifacts put on display at Taxila Museum.
She informed the Thai delegation that there were 4,000 objects, including stone, stucco, terracotta, silver, gold, iron and semiprecious stones, displayed in the museum.
She also briefed the visitors about the history of Gandhara civilisation, various stupas, statues and other artifacts in the museum. The Thai delegation took round of the main hall which exhibits more than 70 stories of the life of Buddha i.e. from the time of his birth till death.
They also visited the Bodhisattva and Buddha galleries. The envoy was informed that hundreds of monasteries and stupas were built together with Greek and Kushan towns such as Sirkap and Sirsukh, both in Taxila.
“Mainly the display consists of objects from 600 BC to 500 AD,” she said. She said that Gandhara is the second holy land of Buddhism and it is the place from where the religion flourished across the globe. She informed that historians believe that the first statue of Buddha was created in Taxila while several historical archaeological Gandhara sites located in different parts of Pakistan’s cities including Taxila, Peshawar, Mardan, and Swat are sacred holy places in the eyes of Buddhists and have potential to attract international tourists from Thailand and other countries.
During their visit, they witnessed some of the oldest historical archaeological artifacts displayed in the museum. The guests showed interest in the history and development of the Buddhist art of Gandhara.
The Thai Monk said that Gandhara tourism is a symbol of the shared Buddhist heritage, and could attract Thai followers of Buddhism.
“Gandhara Civilisation has been in the minds and hearts of Buddhists across the world for thousands of years,” he added.
He said that Thailand and Pakistan had deep rooted diplomatic relations and on the cultural front it has gone on fast track during the last couple of years. He said that in January 2023, the ambassador of Thailand to Pakistan Chakkrid Krachaiwon inaugurated gold plated gallery with bullet-proof glasses to display the holy bone relics of the Lord Buddha at Taxila Museum which was gifted by the Thai government as a token for the decade-old cultural and bilateral relations between the two countries.
He said that the chief monk of Thailand inaugurated the “bell of peace” in Taxila and Peshawar during his visit to Pakistan in 2019.
In July 2022, a 26-member group led by Mr Arayawangso, chief monk of Thailand, and comprising six monks and 20 disciples performed the rituals of ‘rain retreat’ at the stupa in Taxila. He lauded the Pakistan government for preserving sites related to Buddhism and maintaining Taxila as one of the prominent places for Buddhists.
Irfan Karim, who was coordinating the delegation said that the visit of these Thai tourists is designed to explore the awe-inspiring Buddhist remains in Pakistan, once home to the incredible faith and centre of learning for monks. He said that several historical archaeological Gandhara sites located in different parts of Pakistan’s cities including Taxila and northern areas are sacred holy places in the eyes of Buddhists and have potential to attract international tourists from Thailand and other countries

7,Wasa launches drive to test water quality in Rawalpindi,"A comprehensive plan prepared and implemented, city divided into six zones, meeting informed","RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has launched a campaign to test the quality of water from all its sources.
A comprehensive plan for regular monitoring of water quality for surface and ground sources has been prepared and implemented. Rawalpindi city has been divided into six zones: West-I, East-I, West-II, East-II, PP-12 and PP-13, a meeting held with Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) Director General Kinza Murtaza in the chair was informed.
Assistant Director (Water Quality) is getting samples from 40 tubewells and 10 filtration plants in the first phase and it would continue on a weekly basis. A water testing monitoring plan of whole Wasa jurisdiction is completed in three months.
Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf said a water quality analysis laboratory had been established at Rawal Lake Filtration Plant to regularly monitor and analyse the quality of water supplied from there, at the overhead reservoirs of Khanpur Dam, mini-filtration plants and tubewells located in the jurisdiction of Wasa and to analyse the quality of water in the distribution system.

A comprehensive plan prepared and implemented, city divided into six zones, meeting informed

Presently, he said Wasa laboratory was analysing three water quality parameters: physical, chemical and bacteriological. Physical parameters include appearance, temperature, turbidity, conductance and dissolved oxygen while chemical parameters include alkalinity, hardness, sulphate, calcium, magnesium, chlorides, residual chlorine, sulfite, nitrite, ammonia, iron and arsenic of water and bacteriological parameters include total coliform count and fecal coliform count.

Provincial Minister for Transport and Mass Transit Punjab, Bilal Akbar Khan, was the chief guest at the inauguration ceremony.
Mr Khan said that the Punjab chief minister aimed to foster student independence by offering affordable bikes so they could commute to their educational institutions.
He noted, “In the first phase, 1000 motorcycles will be given in five cities, including Rawalpindi,” adding that a total of 20,000 bikes will be given to students in two phases, including 19,000 petrol bikes and 1,000 e-bikes.
The provincial transport minister said that a quota of 50% has been kept for female students in this project, as students of government and private colleges and universities will be able to apply.
Mr Khan said that students applying for motorcycles must possess a license; besides, those with a learning license will also be able to apply for a motorcycle. “Till now, 30 percent of the students who have applied to join the bike scheme are female, and more female students should apply, as the last date for registration of the motorbike scheme is April 29th,” he said.
Mr Bilal further remarked that e-motorbike can travel 100 kilometers in one charge and in the first phase, arrangements will be made for charging e-bikes at the university level.

9,Drug policy needs to focus on ‘harm reduction’ for effective response: speakers,ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a conference organised by the Justice Project of Pakistan urged the government to introduce a...,"ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a conference organised by the Justice Project of Pakistan urged the government to introduce a drug policy that focuses on harm reduction, education, and medication to prevent deaths due to overdose and incentivise rehabilitation for substance use disorders.
Speaking at a plenary session ‘Effective Health and Harm Reduction Responses to Drug Use’, Syed Zulfiqar Hussain, a narcotics policy campaigner, said there were almost 6.7 million drug users in Pakistan and the country did not have an effective “harm reduction treatment” policy. In Lahore alone, there were over 7,000 homeless drug users with as many as 120 “hotspots”.
“There is no specialised treatment centre for women with drug dependence in Pakistan. People who use drugs deserve dignity, respect, and stigma-free care,” said Mr Hussain.
Amir Munir, additional district and sessions judge, said there was a need to develop a consensus regarding drug policy, particularly its legal aspect which treated substance users as pariahs.
He said there was a need to transition from a “legal regime to social regime” in dealing with drug-related cases, advocating a “therapeutic regime” to promote the well-being of offenders.
Zaved Mahmood, who represents the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, said there was a need to follow international human rights principles for effective response to drug cases. He said the social stigma surrounding drugs needed to be removed and called for “decriminalisation” of minor drug charges to encourage rehabilitation. “International law says that every human being has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This applies in the context of drug law, healthcare, and policies,” he added.
Adeeba Kamarulzaman, who joined the session via Zoom, also advocated “pragmatic and socially cohesive” approaches to deal with such cases.
Another session of the day focused on addressing “disparities in access to voluntary, evidence-based treatment and highlighting the importance of framing drug policy as a public health intervention”. One of the panelists Giada Girelli, a senior analyst at Harm Reduction International, said that “we spend 750 times more on punitive drug control measures than we do on life-saving essential harm reduction services”. “This is a violation of the rights of people who use drugs,” she added.
Speaking about the Portuguese experience of placing individuals’ health at the core of the drug policy, MP Ricardo Leite said that “nothing can be copy pasted from one country to another, but there are lessons that can be adapted to any context”.

The speakers at the seminar to commemorate the ‘International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace’ organised by the Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies (IPDS) and Riphah Institute of Public Policy (RIPP), Riphah International University, discussed how multilateralism embodies inherent ideals that harbour the potential to resolve contemporary issues, challenges, and conflicts.
They noted that through dialogue, diplomacy, and collaborative efforts, traditional and non-traditional humanitarian, economic, social, political, and security challenges can be tackled effectively.
Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, while speaking on the occasion, said that Pakistan firmly believes in multilateralism and shared the unique message of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. She said that in today’s interconnected world, Pakistan supports a multilateral diplomatic approach to resolving conflicts and continues its efforts to strive by building bridges and finding common ground. Multilateralism provides the framework to address shared challenges and pursue collective solutions.
Charles Delogne, Ambassador of Belgium in Pakistan, shared various historic initiatives Belgium took over the years, including being the founding member country of various global multilateral organisations that have substantially contributed to building peace and security worldwide. The ambassador said, “We can overcome the complex challenges that transcend borders and threaten peace through collaborative efforts and dialogue”.
Dr. Saad S. Khan, President of the ECO Cultural Institute, highlighted the importance of cultural diplomacy in fostering mutual understanding among nations. Dr. Saad said there was a strong need to build and strengthen multilateral institutions, especially through cultural exchange and dialogue, which were powerful tools in promoting peace and harmony.
“By embracing diversity and engaging in constructive dialogue, we can build stronger ties and mitigate conflicts,” he remarked. Dr. Rashid Aftab, Director of the Riphah Institute of Public Policy, emphasised the importance of institutional mechanisms in facilitating practical multilateral cooperation and said that institutional frameworks were crucial in enabling coordination and collaboration among nations to resolve challenges.
Dr. Rashid noted that by strengthening institutional capacities, the effectiveness of multilateral initiatives can be enhanced and inclusive participation can be ensured. Earlier, in her opening remarks, Dr. Farhat Asif, President of the IPDS, underscored the significance of peacebuilding efforts within the framework of multilateral cooperation. She also shared the message of United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on this important international day.
She said that through collaborative peacebuilding initiatives, we can address the root causes of conflicts and work towards sustainable peace. She also highlighted the role of IPDS in understanding multilateralism through various initiatives. The seminar brought together diplomats, scholars, policymakers, and students to engage in insightful discussions on multilateralism and its pivotal role in fostering peace and stability worldwide.
