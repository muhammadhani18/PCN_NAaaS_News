Jurgen Klopp’s side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.
Jarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.
With Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.
Second-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.
Third-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.
Liverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord’s Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.
It hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February.
Back then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.
Instead, the end of Klopp’s nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.
“Arsenal and Manchester City must have a very bad moment,” Klopp said when asked if Liverpool can win the title.
“I don’t know. I can only apologise for today to the people. We should have done better but we didn’t.”
At Old Trafford, Ten Hag’s side twice trailed to the league’s bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager’s aid in the second half.
Jayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors’ advantage soon after the interval.
Fernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder’s long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.
Rasmus Hojlund got United’s fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.
It was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United’s dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.
Ten Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shootout win after blowing a three-goal lead against second-tier Coventry on Sunday.
“I think we played quite well, also creating many more chances. Many positives. But also negatives. Conceding two goals from giveaways. It’s unacceptable. We want to play dynamic, attacking football,” Ten Hag said.
Earlier, referee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolverhampton Wanderers goal in Bournemouth’s 1-0 win at Molineux.
Attwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday’s 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton Town.
This time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan’s second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo’s opener.
Attwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.
In Wednesday’s other fixture, Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle United.
Mateta broke the deadlock in the 55th minute and added the second late on to end Newcastle’s four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of qualifying for Europe.

BRITAIN’S Emma Raducanu hits a return against Lourdes Carle of Argentina during their Madrid Open first round match at the Park Manzanares.—Reuters

 
MADRID: Naomi Osaka captured her first victory on the surface since 2022 in the Madrid Open first round on Wednesday.Back at the Caja Magica for the first time in two years, Osaka looked comfortable during her 6-4, 6-1 win over Belgian lucky loser Greet Minnen to book a second-round meeting with 15th seed Liudmila Samsonova.
“I’ve had several ‘incidents’ on clay but I’m embracing it a lot more now,” the 26-year-old Osaka told reporters in the Spanish capital.
“I feel like there’s definitely beauty to it. I’m taking a lot of inspiration from people that do very well here. I’m not expecting to be like, Iga (Swiatek), or something, but I just want to do the best with what I have.”
On Arantxa Sanchez stadium on Wednesday, Osaka was breezing through her service games in the opening set but couldn’t convert any of her first three break point opportunities before she finally got the break she needed in the 10th game to take a one-set lead.
The second set was a stroll compared to the first as Osaka built a 5-0 advantage and secured the win with a backhand winner on the 79-minute mark.
“I think I slid a couple of times to my forehand pretty well, so I was excited about that,” explained Osaka.
“She was hitting really good drop shots but I think I got to a couple quite well.”
Osaka has extra motivation to do well on clay this season due to the fact the Olympic Games will be played on the red dirt at Roland Garros this summer.
“The Olympics are a really big goal for me. I would really love to play them,” she said.
Fellow former US Open champion Emma Raducanu was not as fortunate as the Briton fell 6-2, 6-2 to Argentinian qualifier Maria Lourdes Carle.
Raducanu has played just six matches this month — across three events — but blamed mental and physical fatigue for her performance and said she will take a few days off to rest after competing in the Billie Jean King Cup, Stuttgart and Madrid in the last two weeks.
“I think from the performance today it was very clear that mentally and emotionally I was exhausted,” said Raducanu.
“I was trying to push through. I was pushing through Stuttgart and was just unable to push through today. It’s a shame that I was feeling so good on the court and today happened but I guess this sport is just pretty brutal.”
Fresh off a title run in Rouen last week, 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens picked up a sixth consecutive win on clay with a hard-fought 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 success against Italian Martina Trevisan.
Home favourite and former world number two Paula Badosa, who is struggling with long-term back pain since she sustained a stress fracture last year, crashed out 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 to Spanish qualifier Jessica Bouzas Maneiro.

2,WADA to launch independent review into Chinese doping case,Swiss prosecutor Eric Cottier will begin his work in the coming days and is expected to deliver findings under two months.,"LAUSANNE: The under-fire World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said on Thursday it would launch an independent review over its handling of a case that allowed 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned substance to avoid punishment.
The investigation will be led by Swiss prosecutor Eric Cottier, a former attorney general of the canton of Vaud, who WADA said will have access to all files and documents related to the case and will be free to consult any independent experts.
Cottier will begin his work in the coming days and is expected to deliver findings under two months.
“WADAs integrity and reputation is under attack,” said WADA president Witold Banka.
“In the past few days, WADA has been unfairly accused of bias in favour of China by not appealing the CHINADA case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,” he said. “We continue to reject the false accusations and we are pleased to be able to put these questions into the hands of an experienced, respected and independent prosecutor.”
Calls for an independent investigation have gro­wn since a New York Times report on Saturday said 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for the banned drug trimetazidine (TMZ) months be­fore the Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics in July 2021.
The swimmers avoided sanctions after an probe by Chinese authorities ruled the adverse analytical findings, or AAFs, were the result of being inadver­tently exposed to the drug through contamination.
A report determined all the swimmers who tes­ted positive were staying at the same hotel where traces of trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, were discovered in the kitchen.
WADA has defended its handling of the case, saying it had no evidence to challenge China’s findings and that external counsel had advised against appealing them.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency has led the call for an independent investigation along with an overhaul of WADA to restore confidence in the global body ahead of the Paris Olympics.
USADA chief Travis Tygart has accused WADA of being involved in a  “potential cover-up” and the global anti-doping has responded by threatening legal action.
The New York Times reported that the White House had also called for an inquiry as have the anti-doping authorities of Britain and Australia.
In addition to the independent prosecutor, WADA said it will send a compliance audit team to China to assess the state of its anti-doping program and will invite independent auditors from the bro­ader anti-doping community to join the mission.
“While not one shred of evidence has been presented to support any of the allegations made against WADA, we wish to deal with the matter as quickly and as comprehensively as possible so that the matter is appropriately handled in advance of the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games,” said WADA director general Olivier Niggli.

The Suzanne Lenglen will be the second covered court at Roland Garros, four years after the Philippe Chatrier, when the claycourt Grand Slam starts on May 26.
“The Lenglen roof will enable us, in the event of bad weather, to shelter 25,000 people [on the two main courts], to have two matches instead of one being played, and will give us a little more flexibility in our programming,” tournament dir­ector Amelie Mauresmo told a press conference.

Organisers have scrapped the group stage for the finals, scheduled for Nov 12 until Nov 20 this year.
The top four seeded nations will receive byes into the quarters at La Cartuja Stadium in Seville, with the other eight teams to play in round one.
The Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup Finals, which will be held in Malaga from Nov 19, will also overlap for the first time, creating a  “fortnight of World Cup tennis”.
The qualifying rounds were completed earlier in April. Reigning BJK Cup champions Canada were joined in the Finals by Australia, the Czech Republic, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the US and hosts Spain.

5,Atalanta thrash Fiorentina to set up Italian Cup final against Juventus,BERGAMO: Two stoppage-time goals helped Atalanta beat ten-man Fiorentina 4-1 in the second leg of their Coppa Italia...,"BERGAMO: Two stoppage-time goals helped Atalanta beat ten-man Fiorentina 4-1 in the second leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final on Wednesday to send them into the final with a 4-2 aggregate victory.
Atalanta will face record 14-times winners Juventus in the final on May 15 in Rome after Massimi­liano Allegri’s side qua­lified with a 3-2 aggregate win over Lazio despite a 2-1 defeat in the second leg of their semi-final on Tuesday.
Atalanta, who last week eliminated Liverpool from the Europa League quarter-finals, reached their sixth Italian Cup final. They lifted their sole Italian Cup trophy in 1962-63.
Fiorentina beat Atalanta 1-0 at home in the first leg earlier this month, courtesy of a first-half strike by midfielder Rolando Mandragora.
However, Gian Piero Gasperini’s side were quick to level the tie when midfielder Teun Koopmeiners outpaced the Fiorentina defence to score low inside the far post in the eighth minute.
Striker Gianluca Scamacca thought he had doubled Atalanta’s lead five minutes later, firing home from outside the box, but his effort was ruled out for a foul in the buildup.
Atalanta were the more dangerous side and they continued to find their way into Fiorentina’s box as both Koopmeiners and Charles De Ketelaere could have increased the advantage before the break.
Last year’s finalists Fiorentina were reduced to 10 men shortly after the break when defender Nikola Milenkovic was sent off for taking down the racing Scamacca just outside the box.
Despite being outnumbered, Fiorentina equalised through defender Lucas Martinez Quarta, who netted with a header following a free kick.
But Scamacca levelled the tie again in the 75th minute with a stunning scissor kick.
Substitute Ademola Lookman then made it 3-1 on the night in stoppage-time, a strike that was initially ruled out for offside but the referee reversed his decision after a VAR check, before Mario Pasalic put the tie to bed just before the final whistle.

Luis Enrique’s team would have sealed the title later on Wednesday if second-placed AS Monaco had failed to beat Lille at home, but the principality side prevailed 1-0 courtesy of Youssouf Fofana’s second-half strike.
PSG are on 69 points with four games left with Monaco trailing by 11 points.
PSG were without the in-form Bradley Barcola, Marquinhos, Achraf Hakimi, Vitinha and Warren Zaire-Emery who were rested a week before the team’s Champions League semi-final first leg against Borussia Dortmund.
“We did our job. We were serious and we got all three points, despite making numerous changes,” Enrique said.
“As  long as the school year is not finished we cannot get our final grade,”  he added when asked about the prospect of clinching the title.
“What is happening is exciting. We are close, but we still have a month of the season to go, with other things to accomplish.
“There  are seven or eight matches left, and to get to the eighth we will need  to remain fully focused,” added the Spaniard in reference to the  Champions League final at Wembley on June 1.
The capital side went ahead on 19 minutes as Dembele beat two defenders before slotting the ball past Yvon Mvogo from just inside the box.
Three minutes later, Mbappe connected with a Nuno Mendes cross to double the advantage.
Dembele then put the result beyond doubt on the hour mark when he tapped in from Mbappe’s cross.
Mohamed Bamba reduced the arrears in the 73rd minute, but it was too little, too late for a team with 26 points from 30 games.
Mbappe added another one in the last minute with a right-footed effort to take his season tally in the top flight to 26.
Later on Wednesday, Monaco cemented second place thanks to Fofana’s 20-metre strike in the 61st minute, which ended Lille’s three-game winning streak.
Lille are fourth on 52 points, one behind third-placed Stade Brestois and six behind Monaco.
Elsewhere, Olympique de Marseille’s European hopes suffered a blow when they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by fifth-placed OGC Nice, who are on 48 points.
Terem Moffi gave Nice the lead, but Jonathan Clauss levelled for  Marseille who then had Faris Moumbagna sent off at the end of the first  half.
Pierre-Emerick Aubame­yang then put 10-man Marseille ahead from a penalty for his 26th goal of the season in all competitions.
However,  Melvin Bard equalised for Nice, and Marseille are a point adrift of  seventh, which could yet be enough to qualify for Europe depending on  the outcome of the French Cup final between Olympique Lyonnais and PSG on 26th May.

8,Rival PHF factions unite training camp after government intervenes,"Camp will be supervised by Dutchman Roelant Oltmans, who will also head a selection committee that will finalise the squad for next month’s Sultan Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia.","ISLAMABAD: At last, common sense prevailed with the two rival factions of the Pakistan Hockey Federation deciding to end the separate training camps of the national team with an agreement reached that the players will attend the camp underway in Islamabad after the government brought them to the table.
The training camp will be supervised by Dutchman Roelant Oltmans, who will also head a three-member selection committee that will finalise the squad for next month’s Sultan Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia.
The selection committee will also comprise the Pakistan Sports Board director general and a representative of the Pakistan Olympic Association, Prime Minister’s coordinator on Youth Affairs Rana Mashood Ahmed Khan said after he listened to both rival groups at the PM Office on Thursday.
Mashood, who was empowered by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to resolve the issues surrounding the PHF, said matters pertaining to the leadership of the country’s hockey governing body — with one faction led by Tariq Bugti and the other by Shehla Raza — will be decided in the next two days.
The government’s intervention to resolve the PHF matter comes a day after the International Hockey Federation (FIH) had written a letter where it had set a deadline of Thursday to decide on one team that would represent Pakistan at the Azlan Shah Cup.
Oltmans had been appointed by the Bugti group while Shehla’s group was holding a camp in Karachi and had announced a 20-member team for the Azlan Shah Cup.
“Once the team is announced by the selection committee, a camp will be set up in Islamabad ahead of the team’s departure for Malaysia on April 2,” Mashood said in a video message.
“We will resolve the issue of the two factions in the next two days,” he added, while lamenting the downfall of the national game which he attributed to mishandling of hockey affairs by the PHF. “There is a pressing need for a new policy to restore Pakistan hockey to its former standing in the game.”
Alongside Mashood, meetings with both rival groups were also attended by PSB director general Shahid Islam, Higher Education Commission director Javed Memon and Olympian Khawaja Junaid.
Bugti, who was nominated as the PHF chief by interim Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar before getting the required votes from the PHF Congress, presented his case alongside the secretary general of his faction, Rana Mujahid.
Shehla, who was accompanied by the secretary general of her faction Haider Hussain, argued that the interim PM had no power to nominate the PHF chief and was elected by the Congress.
Despite the training camp being held by Bugti’s faction getting the nod by Mashood, a government officer close to the situation said that “nothing had been decided yet”.
“Either the PM can decide which faction to go with or he can reject both and opt for a new PHF chief,” he told Dawn.
Another official, highlighting Pakistan’s rapid decline in international hockey — the national team has failed to qualify for three successive Olympics — said it was time for change.
“The power-hungry people at the helm of the PHF have destroyed the national game,” the official told Dawn. “And therefore, those who have had any role in the PHF during the last two decades should be barred from any future role.”

9,Former skipper Bismah announces retirement,KARACHI: Former Pakistan women’s team captain Bismah Maroof announced her retirement from all cricket with...,"KARACHI: Former Pakistan women’s team captain Bismah Maroof announced her retirement from all cricket with immediate effect on Thursday.
Bismah’s decision came two days after Pakistan were subjected to a 3-0 One-day International whitewash by a visiting West Indies side here. 
The two teams are set to take on each other for as many Twenty20 matches from Friday, and Bismah, who was named in the squad for the series initially, is not be available for it anymore. Her replacement is likely to be announced after the first match.
In the ODI series, Bismah could manage only 91 runs in the three matches as Pakistan failed to show any sort of resistance against Hayley Matthews’ side.
The left-handed batter represented Pakistan in 276 international matches — the most for any women cricketer from the country — after making her debut in an ODI against India in 2006. 
She played her first T20I against Ireland three years later.
During her time as a Pakistan player, she accumulated 6262 runs, including 33 half centuries and bagged 88 wickets with her right-arm leg-spin. 
“I have decided to retire from the game I love the most,” Bismah was quoted as saying in a statement released by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday. “It has been an incredible journey, filled with challenges, victories, and unforgettable memories. 
“I want to express my gratitude to my family, who has supported me throughout my cricketing journey, from the very beginning until now. 
“I also want to extend my thanks to the Pakistan Cricket Board for believing in me and providing the platform to showcase my talent.”
Bismah was handed the Pakistan T20I captaincy in June 2016 and then the ODI role in September 2017. 
She took an indefinite break in December 2020 to prepare for the birth of her daughter, Fatima, and then take care of her but returned in January 2022 for the ODI World Cup.
The PCB introduced a parental policy to support Bismah as she juggled motherhood with cricket.
“The support from the PCB has been invaluable, particularly in implementing the first-ever parental policy for me, which enabled me to represent my country at the highest level while being a mother,” she said.
Bismah was part of the Pakistan side team that won the gold medal twice in the Asian Games, in 2010 and 2014. She also represented the national side in four editions of the ODI World Cup (2009, 2013, 2017, and 2022), captaining the team in the 2022 edition held in New Zealand. 
Bismah played eight editions of the T20 World Cup (2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2023) and led the side in the 2020 and 2023 editions held in Australia and South Africa, respectively.

10,Fakhar’s effort in vain as depleted New Zealand stun Pakistan again,LAHORE: Silence engulfed the fully-packed Gaddafi Stadium as Ben Sears punched into the air and Fakhar Zaman hung ...,"LAHORE: Silence engulfed the fully-packed Gaddafi Stadium as Ben Sears punched into the air and Fakhar Zaman hung his head, walking dejected towards the pavilion.
With notions on the rise that Fakhar’s time as a Pakistan player was over, the left-hander was featuring for the first time in the penultimate of the five-match Twenty20 International series here on Thursday.
And he was standing tall while all his colleagues failed to negotiate with a 179-run target set by a third-string New Zealand side. After Pakistan had fallen to 80-4 by the halfway stage, Fakhar, with Iftikhar Ahmed’s support, had kept the hosts alive with his trademark power-hitting on a slow surface.
But soon after Iftikhar lofted a drive into the hands of James Neesham at deep cover to give pacer William O’Rourke his third wicket in the 17th over, Fakhar uncharacteristically flicked Sears directly to Dean Foxcroft at the square-leg boundary to find his dreams of a resurgent win for Pakistan shattered with 61 off 45 balls against his name.
There was still hope, but a special effort was required. And was expected from Imad Wasim. The veteran, however, had to see off Abbas Afridi — to a horrific run-out — and Usama Mir at the other end.
With the four brave boundaries that he hit, all Imad could do was to reduce the distance between Pakistan and a win to four runs. For New Zealand, the victory meant they could not lose the series if not win it. Pakistan, meanwhile, have a plethora of questions as they build up towards the T20 World Cup.
After pacers Abbas and Mohammad Amir had restricted New Zealand from piling up bigger total, Pakistan’s show in the powerplay was poor as they lost three wickets — those of captain Babar Azam, his opening partner Saim Ayub and Usman Khan — for 47 runs while the field restrictions prevailed.
Fakhar took up the rescue mission, and the southpaw got going with a towering six over square leg off a half-tracker by leg-spinner Ish Sodhi before placing him intelligently through point for four more in the ninth over. 
But right when a partnership between Fakhar and Shadab Khan was taking a direction, the latter holed New Zealand captain and off-spinner Michael Bracewell out to Neesham at deep midwicket to leave Pakistan needing 99 to win in the last 10 overs.
New Zealand kept it tight with the ball hardly coming onto the bat until in the 14th over, Fakhar launched Bracewell over long-on for six before Iftikhar cleared long-off for another as Pakistan hoped for recovery.
Fakhar lifted Duffy over long-off two overs later to bring up his half-century in 38 balls before losing Iftikhar and then falling himself to effectively kill Pakistan’s hopes. 
Put into bat first on a belter of a surface, New Zealand got off to an explosive start before the Pakistan bowlers put the brakes on the flow of runs in the latter stages of the innings.
The major damage from the BlackCaps’ side was caused by openers Tom Blundell and Tim Robinson, who smashed 28 off 15 and 51 off 26 respectively. 
But then Abbas stood out for Pakistan with three wickets for 20 runs in three overs, while Amir responded to a beating in the first over by conceding only 18 runs in his next three.
Blundell and Robinson had boosted the visitors to 54-1 by the end of the powerplay, on the last ball of which Blundell fell to Zaman Khan.
The incoming Foxcroft was dropped by spinner Imad off his own bowling when he was playing at four. Robinson continued the attack and brought up his 50 in 34 balls at almost the halfway stage, with New Zealand cruising at 93-1.
The right-hander, however, gave away his wicket in the very next over, skying a slower one by Abbas for Iftikhar to take a well-judged catch at the long-on boundary.
New Zealand were barely moved by Robinson’s dismissal as the incoming Mark Chapman authoritatively cut Abbas for a boundary on the very first ball that he faced before Foxcroft used his feet brilliantly to dispatch Usama for two sixes in the next over.
Amid the fireworks by the BlackCaps, Shadab pulled up a spectacular fielding effort to dismiss Chapman off Iftikhar’s off-spin. A livewire of a fielder, Shadab dived to his left to take a one-handed catch at cover as the left-hander made room in an attempt to hit Iftikhar. 
Pakistan struck again in the next over when Foxcroft holed Usama out to Fakhar at the deep mid-wicket boundary. Bracewell also fell to a decent catch by Iftikhar at the long-on boundary again, becoming Abbas’ second wicket in the penultimate over.
Abbas followed that up with a perfect yorker to castle Josh Clarkson before Amir took deceived Sodhi to take his only wicket on the last ball of the New Zealand innings.

LAHORE: Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has acted quickly and decisively in the wake of Pakistan’s dismal performance in the Women’s One-day International series against the West Indies. The women’s national team selection committee has been reconstituted, expanded to seven members, after Pakistan were swept aside in the series.
“The retained members from the previous panel include Asmavia Iqbal and Marina Iqbal,” the PCB said in a news release, adding that Abdul Razzaq and Azad Shafiq, who are also members of the men’s national selection committee, and former international Batool Fatima have been inducted.
“In line with the men’s national selection committee make-up, the coach and captain will also be part of the national women’s selection committee. The immediate task of the new selection committee will be to choose the Pakistan women’s team for the upcoming tour of England, where they are scheduled to play three T20Is and three ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 fixtures.”
Despite the 3-0 loss to the West Indies, Pakistan currently hold fifth position in the 10-team ICC Women Championship 2022-25. The top five teams from this championship, along with hosts India, will directly qualify for the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025. The remaining teams will participate in a Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament.
