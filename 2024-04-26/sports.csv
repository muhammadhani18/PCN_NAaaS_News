2,AJK man shot dead resisting robbery,"Kahuta police launch manhunt, fail to arrest culprits","A citizen was killed while another was injured for resisting a robbery in the Kahuta area in Rawalpindi.
According to a spokesperson for the police, the disturbing unfolded within the jurisdiction of the Kahuta police station where bandits opened fire on passengers during the robbery, killing one of the passengers and injuring the driver.
He further said the passenger bus was travelling from Kahuta to Lahore when the driver opted for a shorter route off the main path during nighttime. Upon stopping at a junction in Kahuta, the bus was surrounded by criminals who proceeded to rob the passengers of their valuables, including mobile phones and cash.
During the chaos, one passenger managed to apprehend a criminal inside the bus. This prompted other accomplices of the criminals to start shooting upon realising their companion was caught. Tragically, a passenger from Poonch Azad Kashmir lost his life due to a gunshot, and the bus driver, Akhtar Khan from Kahuta, sustained a severe gunshot wound to the abdomen, currently in critical condition. The criminals fled the scene.
Upon receiving the report, Kahuta SHO rushed to the spot with the police team. The deceased passenger and the injured driver were swiftly taken to the hospital. Inspector Aziz Aslam said a case is being registered based on the driver's account. Meanwhile, Rawalpindi Operations SSP Hafiz Kamran Asghar took immediate action upon learning of the incident. He visited the site with senior officers and formed specialised teams under the leadership of DSP Kahuta to apprehend the culprits.

3,Courier service rider ‘steals’ rare Husky pup,"Islamabad resident seeks FIA, police assistance in canine pet’s recovery","In a bizarre incident of theft, a ride-hailing service driver made off with a puppy of a rare breed belonging to a citizen in the federal capital.
Despite seeking assistance from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)’s Cybercrime Unit and local police, the whereabouts of the rider remain elusive.
Hamadul Hasan, a resident of Sector H-13, Islamabad, filed a complaint with both the FIA Cyber Crime Unit and Islamabad police. In his statement, he mentioned booking a courier service via the In-drive App to transport a pair of rare breed pet dogs to Faizabad. However, upon the driver's arrival at the specified location, it was discovered that the car and its registration number were different.
Upon inquiry, the driver claimed the original car had been damaged, necessitating the use of an alternate vehicle. The pets were entrusted to the driver, Umair Zulfikar, for delivery to Jabir Shah in Faizabad, with the pets kept in a vehicle bearing registration number IDN-8464. To ensure proof of delivery, a video was recorded for the recipient's verification.
However, during the delivery process, the driver took one of the dogs and arranged for another motorcycle rider to transport it to Faizabad. Upon receipt of the dog, Jabir Shah confirmed the delivery of one dog. Despite repeated attempts to contact the driver via messages and calls, there was no response. The complaint lodged with the ride-hailing company online remained unresolved.
Given the dog's value of Rs0.2 million, legal steps are being taken to recover the pet.
The FIA Cybercrime Circle in Islamabad has initiated an investigation into the incident and has sent a letter to the relevant company, seeking comprehensive details about the driver. Despite efforts, The Express Tribune's attempts to contact the company on their G-7 Islamabad number were futile as the number was consistently switched off.
