Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said institutional profit-taking in selected overbought scrips and adjustments in the earning season stalled the overnight rally.  
He added that the weak rupee and structural reforms for the new IMF programme are likely to withdraw subsidies in the energy, fertiliser, and gas sectors, and expectations over the status quo in the SBP policy announcement next week depressed market sentiments.
According to Topline Securities Ltd, sectors such as oil and gas exploration, auto, banking, cement, and fertiliser contributed to the index’s decline, with companies like Millat Tractors Ltd, Pakistan Oilfield Ltd, Lucky Cement, Faysal Bank Ltd, and Engro Corporation wiped out 206 points. 
Conversely, United Bank Ltd, Oil and Gas Development Company, and Engro Fertilisers collectively contributed 167 points.
As a result, the index hit an intraday high of 72,593.25, with a 541.36-point gain and a low of 71,700.54, shedding 351.36 points. However, it closed at 71,971.40 points after losing 80.49 points, or 0.11pc, from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume surged 33.22pc to 798.52 million shares. The traded value also rose 12.60pc to Rs27.54bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric Ltd (119.64m shares), WorldCall Telecom (79.95m shares), Unity Foods Ltd (44.27m shares), Pak International Bulk Terminal (33.57m shares) and Fauji Foods Ltd (30.12m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs74.31), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs28.33), Honda Atlas Cars (Pakistan) Ltd (Rs20.92), Abbott Laboratories Ltd (Rs19.81) and Thal Ltd Rs18.20.

1,FCA sets targets for major crops for kharif season,"KARACHI: The Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA), the high-powered body mandated to oversee strategic measures ...","KARACHI: The Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA), the high-powered body mandated to oversee strategic measures for ensuring food security in the country, has set the production targets of major crops for the kharif season 2024-25. 
At its meeting in Islamabad on Wednesday, the FCA decided to set production targets for cotton at 10.8 million bales, 8.7m tonnes for rice, 9.3m tonnes for maize, and 76.7m tonnes for sugarcane. Targets for other crops such as mung, mash, and chilies were also fixed.
Chaired by Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, the committee meeting, attended by provincial agricultural departments and key stakeholders, noted that water availability in canals will remain at 63.61 million acre-feet (MAF), compared to last year’s 61.85 MAF. Currently, all provinces are receiving satisfactory supplies in the system.
The director general of Federal Seed Certification informed the meeting that seeds of rice, maize, sesame, and mung bean will remain available as required.
The FCA directed concerned departments to remain vigilant in balancing the supply and demand situation of fertiliser for quick import decisions to meet domestic requirements during the upcoming kharif season.
An official from the State Bank of Pakistan informed that allocations of institutional credit for agriculture had substantially increased to Rs2,250 billion for 2023-24. Disbursements up to February 2023 reached Rs1,073.5bn, which is 59 per cent of the overall annual target of Rs1,819bn and 28.5pc higher than the disbursement of Rs835.3bn made during the previous year.
The Meteorological Department informed the FCA meeting that from April to June, normal to slightly above normal precipitation is expected in most parts of the country, particularly over upper Punjab from May to July. 
Above normal precipitation is likely in August and September 2024. The area-weighted normal rainfall of Pakistan during the monsoon season is 140.8 millimetres. 
While reviewing the performance of the outgoing rabi season crops for 2023-24, the committee observed that wheat production is estimated at 29.69m tonnes from an area of 9.6m hectares, a 5.4pc increase over the last year.

2,"US, Pakistan renew trade framework","A statement issued after the Lu-Aurangzeb meeting says their discussions underscored ""the political will in Washington"" to strengthen Pak-US ties.","WASHINGTON: Following Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s extensive visit to Washington, the United States and Pakistan renewed a key framework on Wednesday to promote bilateral trade.
The Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), signed in 2003, is a vital platform for addressing bilateral trade issues. The US and Pakistan concluded the 9th TIFA meeting in February 2023. The last intersessional talks were held in Islamabad in May 2019.
The talks also followed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s significant visit to Pakistan, during which the two sides explored various options for boosting trade to $10 billion over the next five years.
When asked for comments on the proposed deals between Pakistan and Iran a day after President Raisi’s visit, a US State Department spokesperson, Vedant Patel, said: “We advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions.”
On Wednesday, Thomas Montgomery, the acting spokesperson at the US mission in Islamabad, told journalists that officials from both nations deliberated on various avenues to bolster their trade and investment relationship.
The dialogue encompassed a wide array of topics, including good regulatory practices, digital trade, intellectual property protection, women’s economic empowerment, labour standards, textiles, investment, and agricultural issues,“ he added.
The US embassy official also mentioned that ‘progress was made on crucial matters,’ such as access to US biotechnology products and beef within Pakistan.
During his visit, Finance Minister Aurangzeb also met US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu, a prominent figure in the so-called ‘cipher controversy’ that led to the ouster of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Washington denies any involvement in the parliamentary move to remove Mr Khan.
A statement issued after the Lu-Aurangzeb meeting said their discussions underscored ‘the political will in Washington’ to strengthen Pak-US ties.
The Iran-Pakistan joint statement emphasised the importance of cooperation in the energy sector, including trade in electricity, power transmission lines, and the import of Iranian natural gas through a long-delayed pipeline project linking Pakistan and Iran, without sharing further details.
However, the United States has repeatedly warned Islamabad against joining the pipeline project with Tehran, citing sweeping sanctions on Iran’s energy sector over its nuclear programme.
The recent developments underscore the complex dynamics at play in the region as nations navigate economic partnerships amidst geopolitical considerations and international sanctions.
The timing of the TIFA engagement is particularly significant, as such interactions are essential in advancing mutual objectives and strengthening economic relations.
The statement also emphasised the current status of economic ties, pointing out that the US stands as Pakistan’s largest export market, with ample potential for further expansion.

3,Roshan digital accounts inflows jump 29pc in March,"The breakdown of inflows in March shows that out of the total inflow, $17 million has been repatriated so far.","KARACHI: March emerged as the most beneficial month of the current financial year for the country, as inflows from all sources increased, along with a 29 per cent rise in receipts through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA).
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that inflows through RDA increased by $182 million in March, up 29pc from $141m in February, bringing the total to $7.660 billion, compared to $7.478bn in the previous month. This growth is encouraging for both the SBP and the government, as they struggle to improve their payment capacity for imports and debt servicing.
The breakdown of inflows in March, as reported by the SBP, shows that out of the total inflow ($182m), $17m has been repatriated so far. The amount utilised locally during the same month was $135m, resulting in a net liability to be repatriated of about $30m.
The country has received a total amount of $7.66bn under RDA so far. This is encouraging for the government, as out of these total inflows, $4.8bn has been utilised locally. This indicates that the inflow under RDA has reduced the burden on the SBP to provide more dollars. The SBP reported that $1.576bn under RDA has been repatriated so far, leaving $1.283bn to be repatriated.
In the same month, March, the government received $3bn in remittances, much higher than February, which supported the declining foreign exchange reserves and helped the central bank maintain a stable exchange rate. Another positive report was about the inflow of foreign investment in treasury bills, which exceeded the inflow for the record-breaking equity market, reaching $20m in the first nine days of April.
The number of accounts under RDA also increased in March to 679,792 from 668,701 the previous month.
The highest amount, $840m, came for the Naya Pakistan Certificates (NPCs). According to the SBP website, $312m was in conventional NPCs and $528m in Islamic instruments.
RDA was launched to bring back the outflow of foreign investments from domestic bonds after the emergence of Covid-19. While it succeeded in attracting dollars, it did not do so at the rate or frequency with which foreign investors had turned towards treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds before Covid-19. The country received more than $4.5bn in domestic bonds, but more than 90pc left the country within a few months of Covid-19.

4,World Bank sees fall in commodity prices,Warns Middle East tensions could hit global progress on inflation.,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank projects that global commodity prices will fall 3 per cent in 2024, but the conflict in the Middle East could halt the inflationary decline.
“The World Bank commodity price index is expected to fall 4pc in 2024, following a projected decline of nearly 24pc in 2023, the sharpest drop since the pandemic”, noted the latest Commodity Markets Outlook (CMO) released on Thursday.
Energy prices are expected to decline by almost 5pc in 2024 and remain relatively stable in 2025. Agriculture prices are expected to decline over the forecast period, while metal prices are set to fall in 2024 but see a 6pc uptick in 2025, the CMO forecast assuming that the conflict in the Middle East will have a limited impact on commodity prices, though geopolitical risks remain high.
On the other hand, disappointing global growth presented a downside risk, especially for industrial commodities, the CMO said. Additional trade restrictions and intensification of El Niño could push food prices higher, it warned.

Warns ME tensions could hit global progress on inflation

The report said global commodity prices were now leveling off after a steep descent that played a decisive role in reducing overall inflation last year. This could make it harder for central banks to cut interest rates quickly.
The World Bank’s forecasts call for a decline of 3pc in global commodity prices in 2024 and 4pc in 2025. That pace will do little to subdue inflation that remains above central bank targets in most countries. It will keep commodity prices about 38pc higher than they were on average in the five years before the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Global inflation remains undefeated,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank Group’s Chief Economist and Senior Vice President. “A key force for disinflation — falling commodity prices — has essentially hit a wall. That means interest rates could remain higher than currently expected this year and next. The world is at a vulnerable moment: a major energy shock could undermine much of the progress in reducing inflation over the past two years.”
Persistently high geopolitical tensions over the past two years have propped up the price of oil and many other critical commodities even as global growth has slowed. The price of Brent crude oil, for example, surged to $91 per barrel earlier this month — nearly $34 per barrel above the 2015-2019 average.
The CMO projected that Brent prices will average $84 per barrel in 2024 before declining to an average of $79 in 2025, assuming no conflict-related supply disruptions.

5,‘Modern warehousing can transform agriculture’,"""Robust growth in the agriculture sector"" a macroeconomic indicator ""underscoring the country's economic outlook"", says finance minister.","LAHORE: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said that Pakistan’s current economic outlook can help the private and financial sectors transform agriculture in the country.
He was speaking at the concluding session of ‘Agri Connections 2024’ at the Expo Centre on Thursday.
“Robust growth in the agriculture sector, declining inflation rates, strong value of the rupee, strong remittance inflows, rising forex reserves, and a buoyant stock market are stable macroeconomic indicators underscoring the country’s improved economic outlook,” he said.
“We want to facilitate farm machinery service providers, and we need a major scale-up of modern agri warehousing under the EWRs financing that allows agri commodities to be traded nationally and internationally,” said the minister.
Ahsan Rana, an Associate Professor at LUMS, said the country’s overly regulated seed system is unsuitable for agriculture’s growth.
“Cumbersome procedures have made our seed system depend on the government, making Pakistan stay in the lowest ranks in this domain according to the World Bank.”
He said that compliance should be voluntary, enforcement should be limited to few aberrations, a two-tier system for seed companies should be developed, and the regulator should become a facilitator.
Maria Saleem, GM Agri-Business, Fatima Group, said that an additional $18 billion can be generated by enhancing wheat yields per acre by freeing up 5 million acres of cotton land.
She added that Pakistan could earn $1.6bn by planting canola/raya on 5 million acres saved from the wheat area, as Pakistan imports 4 million tonnes of edible oil worth $4bn annually.

6,Govt plans urea imports to ensure price stability,The local producers have increased the urea prices by Rs500 to Rs700 per 50kg bag.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid continuously rising domestic prices, the government on Thursday decided to import at least 200,000 tonnes of urea to meet ongoing kharif requirements.
Subject to the proverbial endorsement by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet in its upcoming meeting, a decision to import urea was taken at a meeting of the Fertiliser Review Committee (FRC) presided over by Minister for Industries and Production Rana Tanveer Hussain.
In recent days, the local producers have increased the urea prices, one after the other, by Rs500 to Rs700 per 50kg bag during the current month alone without any noticeable movement in input costs amid estimates that urea consumption could be 18-20pc higher this season.
The relevant authorities are already reported to have sought explanations from the urea producers, who have also been holding back hundreds of billions of rupees collected from consumers on account of Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) for more than a decade.
The Ministry of Industries and Production said in a statement that it had “recommended the import of 200,000 tonnes of urea to stabilise prices and supply in the country during kharif.” 
It said the decision was taken in the FRC meeting after analysing consumption patterns, available stock, and future needs during the kharif season.
The meeting was told that demand for urea increased by 3.6 per cent compared to the previous year. The anticipated demand for the kharif season is approximately 3.442 million tonnes. The available stock in the country stood at approximately 3.192m tonnes. The shortfall will be met by importing 200,000 tonnes, and the rest will be met by increasing production in the local fertiliser plants.
“All local urea plants will remain operational at full capacity to meet the demand,” the statement said, adding that the government was ensuring smooth gas supply to the fertiliser industry.
The minister said the timely arrival of imported urea would help ensure food security by increasing farmers’ productivity and stabilising local prices.

7,SBP reserves down by $74m,SBP reports the country’s total reserves reached $13.280 billion.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange reserves declined by $74 million to $7.981 billion during the week ending April 19.
The central bank announced on Thursday that the decline was due to external debt repayments. 
The SBP paid $1bn in the second week of this month against the maturity of Eurobonds but did not report any decline in its forex holdings. This was surprising for many who were watching the development keenly. The SBP has not explained how it succeeded in keeping the reserves above $8bn even after clearing its $1bn Eurobond liability.
The finance minister recently said that the SBP reserves would reach $10bn to $11bn by the end of June. He expects to receive $1.1bn from the IMF as the last tranche of the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement expiring this month.
According to SBP report, the country’s total reserves reached $13.280bn including $5.299bn held by commercial banks. 
Due to import restrictions, the interbank currency market remains cool, and the banks feel no dollar demand pressure. At the same time, the exporters have been selling their maximum export proceeds to avoid any possible loss in case the local currency further appreciates against the US dollar.
