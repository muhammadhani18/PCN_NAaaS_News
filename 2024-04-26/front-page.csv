• Six-judge Supreme Court bench to resume suo motu proceedings on ‘meddling’ on 30th
KARACHI: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa said on Thursday that no incidents of interference in judicial matters had occurred since he took charge of the top court.
Speaking at an event organised by the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA), Justice Isa emphasised that while interference in the working of the judiciary is unacceptable, no such incidents had been reported to him since he assumed office in September last year, adding that recent complaints by high court judges referred to events that transpired before he was sworn in as the CJP.
The top judge’s remarks came a month after six of the eight Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges wrote a startling letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, complaining about interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus.
The letter, dated March 25, was signed by judges Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
A day later, calls emerged from various quarters for an investigation into the judges’ complaints. Subsequently, Justice Isa summoned a full court meeting of the Supreme Court judges.
After a meeting between Justice Isa and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 28, the duo decided to form a commission to investigate interference allegations in judicial affairs following the cabinet’s approval.
However, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was appointed to head the commission, recused himself from the matter, prompting the Supreme Court to take a suo motu notice of the issue.
On April 3, Justice Isa asserted that any attack on the judiciary’s independence would not be tolerated as he hinted at forming a full court to hear the suo motu case.
A six-judge Supreme Court bench will resume the hearing of the case on April 30. Headed by Chief Justice Isa, the bench will also include Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Athar Minallah, Musarrat Hilali and Naeem Akhtar Afghan. Earlier, Justice Yahya Afridi recused himself from the bench.
In his SHCBA address on Thursday, Justice Isa said the incidents mentioned in the IHC letter were from before his tenure as the top judge began.
“I would like to say one thing that since I have been chief justice, I have not received a single complaint from any high court judge that there has been any interference in their work,” the chief justice said.
“Now, if there has been any interference in their work, it has not been reported to me and all the incidents that were mentioned were before my watch, before I took the oath as the CJP,” he said. “So, this is a thing to bear in mind because interference is not acceptable but at the same time nothing has been reported to me during my watch.”
Justic Isa also lauded the support extended by the SHCBA for the six IHC judges who wrote the letter. He also appreciated the association for its initiatives for human rights and other such issues.
New SC building in Karachi
In addition to addressing judicial independence, Justice Isa discussed a significant new development project — a new building for the Supreme Court’s Karachi registry, opposite the main entrance of the Sindh High Court.
Covering nearly seven acres and estimated to cost between Rs6 billion and Rs8 billion, the project aims to centralise federal tribunals and special courts in one facility. The federal government has approved this plan, which seeks to reduce recurring expenses and logistical challenges currently faced due to scattered court locations.
Justice Isa also reminisced about his days practising law in Karachi, pointing out the difficulties with parking and accessing court facilities. He advocated for better record-keeping and the consolidation of federal court functions to improve efficiency and access.
The CJP said that he along with Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail met the other day with the apex court building committee and it was noted that the present Supreme Court building in Karachi was iconic and a protected heritage site. The matter about its restoration to its original position as much as possible also came under discussion during the meeting.
“I also suggested to the provincial government for preservation of other similar buildings located in the city,” Justice Isa added.
Sindh High Court Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi and SHCBA President Rehan Aziz Malik also spoke on the occasion.

1,"Hot and cold Senate session sees barbs, offers of support",Dar seconds Shibli’s offer for reconciliation to tackle challenges; bipartisan committee to examine tax amendments.,"ISLAMABAD: The first regular session of the Senate after its most recent election turned out to be hot and cold where opposition and treasury benches traded barbs but also agreed on working together to pull the country out of the economic quagmire.
The session on Thursday started with 11 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa seats vacant since the election wasn’t held there over the delay in the administration of oath to KP assembly members elected on reserved seats.
As the first order of business, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani took oath from Faisal Vawda and Maulana Abdul Wasay, who became Senate members after winning the election on April 2.
Their oath taking was delayed as the two senators were not present in the house’s opening session on April 7.

Dar seconds Shibli’s offer for reconciliation to tackle challenges; bipartisan committee to examine tax amendments

In a fiery speech after the oath, the newly appointed opposition leader, Shibli Faraz, questioned the legitimacy of the present assemblies and demanded a thorough investigation into the discrepancies in Form-45 and Form-47 of the recently held general elections.
He regretted that general elections were not conducted in Punjab and KP within the constitutional deadline of 90 days after the dissolution of provincial assemblies.
“The Constitution was violated in the same way in the case of the National Assembly.”
The PTI was “deprived” of its election symbol and “ridiculous and confusing symbols” like brinjal and pumpkin were allotted to its candidates, Mr Faraz said.
The majority of voters “gave the mandate to PTI” which was “stolen through wide-scale manipulations in the Forms-47”.
“We are a reality. You cannot set us aside”, he remarked.
The PTI leader claimed that at present, the country had “the highest number of political prisoners, with 99.9 per cent of them belonging to PTI”.
He ended his speech with an offer of reconciliation, underlining the need for collective efforts to address Pakistan’s enormous challenges.
‘Let us work together’
His view was endorsed by Leader of the House Ishaq Dar from across the aisle.
“Let us work together. Let us get Pakistan out of the quagmire”, he said while offering an olive branch to the opposition.
Mr Dar said the task was “doable” and “it all depends on how we act”.
“Let us bury the past”, he remarked and underlined the need to bring the blame game to an end and stop the distortion of facts.
Both the government and the opposition would have to work together on the privatisation process, energy sector reforms and other issues while sitting in standing committees, Mr Dar added.
Before his offer of reconciliation, Mr Dar had chided the PTI for its alleged involvement in May 9 attacks. “You committed a blunder. You challenged the state itself and endangered it.”
“You should not have gone to this extent in politics”, he remarked and asked the PTI leaders to prove their innocence before courts of law.
The house leader also rejected criticism over election rigging and questioned: “How elections were fair in KP and unfair in Punjab?”
Mr Dar also rejected other accusations levelled by the opposition leader, including the delay in the release of funds for general elections.
He said that the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement government had “released every penny” for general elections, as mentioned in the 2023 budget.
On the issue of Senate elections in KP, the house leader said it was a matter between the ECP, provincial government and courts.
Former caretaker prime minister and now senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar also replied to the opposition leader’s comments about the delay in holding elections.
He said the 90-day limit was a constitutional requirement, but so was holding a census every ten years.
The caretaker government had no desire to extend its stint but it was a compulsion to carry out fresh delimitation, Mr Kakar reasoned.
‘Generals, judges should sign affidavit’
Mr Vawda, in his first speech on the floor of the house, said the affidavit about dual citizenship submitted by lawmakers should also be submitted by all generals and judges.
Asserting the supremacy of the parliament, the former PTI leader said the two houses legislate laws, and they should have the right to interpret them as well rather than allowing others to interpret them as per their will.
New bills introduced
The government also introduced three bills: the Election (Amendment) Bill, 2024, the Motion Pictures (Amendment) Bill, 2023 and the Establishment of Special Court (Overseas Pakistanis Property) Bill, 2023, during the session, APP reported.
Chairman Gillani referred the bills to the standing committees concerned for detailed deliberation.
Since the standing committee on finance was yet to be formed, the Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill 2024 was referred to a special committee formed earlier by the chairman.
The three-member committee comprising Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar and PPP’s Farooq H. Naek will submit its report to the house on Monday.

2,"FBR, interior ministry told to crack down on rampant oil smuggling",Directed to take “appropriate and immediate action to address this critical issue”.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid supply chain challenges leading to the closure of refining units and storage constraints, the government has asked the Mini­stry of Interior and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to start immediate operations against oil smuggling with the support of other stakeholders.
Informed sources told Dawn the prime minister had also taken up the matter with the defence authorities to extend maximum support to the civil agencies concerned in eradicating smuggling, which causes annual losses of hundreds of billions of rupees and negatively affects the smooth functioning of the petroleum supply chain, including refineries and marketing companies.
Separately, the Ministry of Interior and the FBR have been directed to take “appropriate and immediate action to address this critical issue”, according to a communication of the petroleum division based on a complaint by the Oil Companies Advisory Cou­ncil (OCAC) to the Special Investment Faci­litation Council (SIFC) and the Prime Minister’s Office.
Interestingly, all the five domestic refineries jointly, individually and as part of the OCAC — an umbrella organisation of about three dozen refineries and petroleum marketing companies — have been writing almost daily to the petroleum division and the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) about the challenges to their survival and threat to about $6 billion worth of upgradation plans because of the massive influx of smuggled oil products in the market.
Referring to letters to the SIFC, the petroleum division said the OCAC had highlighted the issue of petroleum smuggling, which posed a grave threat to the forthcoming investments in refinery expansion and upgradation projects under the Oil Refining Policy for Upgradation of Brownfield Refineries, 2023.
“This illicit activity not only bleeds the economy but also jeopardises the opportunity for substantial investments in refinery upgradation,” the petroleum division wrote to the interior ministry and the FBR on Thursday. “The ramifications extend beyond the refinery sector, impacting the profitability of oil marketing companies (OMCs), dealers, and disrupting the white oil pipeline operations.”
The petroleum division said the refineries were currently carrying huge stocks of high-speed diesel (HSD) due to the availability of smuggled fuel in the market. This reduced refinery throughput and production of other petroleum products.
“This situation is disturbing the entire oil supply chain and needs immediate correction,” the Ministry of Interior and FBR were told.
On the same day, the OCAC again reminded Ogra and the petroleum division that HSD stocks had reached a “critically high” level, enough for 44 days of consumption cover.
This posed “significant challenges to the sustainability of the oil industry. The alarming disparity between the high stocks of HSD (650,000 tonnes in storage) and the persistently low sales (14,700 tonnes against the planned 23,000 tonnes) is primarily attributable to the rampant smuggling of POL (petroleum, oil and lubricant) products from Western borders, has started to exert adverse effects on the refineries and OMCs”, the advisory council said.
The OCAC reminded Ogra that extensive deliberations on strategies to address the issue in many monthly product review meetings had been unsuccessful due to the pervasive influence of smuggled products.
“Demand destruction and surplus inventory have created a vicious circle, wherein the industry is struggling to maintain operational viability.”
The oil industry urged Ogra and the petroleum division to “recognise the cascading implications of this challenging situation, exacerbating financial strain throughout the supply chain”.
While the OMCs legitimately sold HSD during the peak agriculture season, suppressed market demand impacted their cash flows, rendering the oil marketing companies unable to fulfil their financial obligations to refineries and simultaneously retire letters of credit (LCs) for imported products.
Consequently, refineries’ ability to make timely payments for crude oil imports will be compromised. Because of these issues, the oil industry will again face similar challenges as encountered in 2022, when establishing LCs became an uphill task due to the country’s rating in the international market.
Due to high HSD stock levels, refineries were also constrained from curtailing their throughput, which also impacted the production of petrol and jet fuel.
The OCAC called upon the government institutions to “take immediate and decisive actions to restore market equilibrium and save the refineries, white oil pipeline and OMCs from collapse. The refineries also warned of “a serious threat to the opportunity of huge investment in the country due to the staggering influx of smuggled petroleum products from Iran”.
“It would, therefore, be most unfortunate if the planned upgradation projects are dela­y­ed or abandoned due to continued illicit activity which is already bleeding the economy and has disrupted the entire supply chain of petroleum products, adversely affecting the refinery health, white oil pipeline operations, and the profitability of oil marketing companies and dealers,” the council warned.

4,Court bars Imran’s outbursts against ‘institutions’,"Asks prosecution, accused, and their defence counsel not to make political or inflammatory statements which may disrupt decorum of the court.","• Ex-PM, spouse ordered to refrain from criticising army and judiciary; media asked not to highlight ‘inflammatory remarks’
• Govt following ‘pre-partition’ protocols to protect confidential documents, IHC observes in cipher case
ISLAMABAD: An accountability court in Islamabad on Thursday ordered former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi to refrain from speaking against the establishment and the judiciary, and also asked the media not to highlight “political or inflammatory” statements made by the accused.
Judge Rana Nasir Javed, while disposing of a petition seeking a fair trial in the Al-Qadir Trust case, barred the PTI founder and his wife from speaking against “institutions”.
According to the court order, Imran Khan issued provocative political statements against senior officials of the state institutions, including the army and the judiciary, which “not only disrupt the judicial decorum but also tantamount to obstruct judicial functions such as the dispensation of justice”.
The court also asked the prosecution, the accused, and their defence counsel not to make political or inflammatory statements which may disrupt the decorum of the court.
The judge also asked journalists to refrain from “publishing political and inflammatory narratives targeting state institutions and officials” and adhere to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority’s (Pemra) guidelines, which prohibit discussing sub judice matters.
The former premier has been taking potshots at the establishment during his interactions with media persons in the courtroom. Recently, the temporary courtroom was restructured and the administration raised the height of the partition walls to nine feet.
Initially, there was no partition and the hall was divided into three parts; one reserved for Mr Khan and his legal team, the second for media persons and the third for the general public. Last Friday, the presiding judge directed jail authorities to remove unnecessary walls erected in the makeshift courtroom inside the jail.
Cipher case
During the hearing of the cipher case, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) observed the government was following “pre-partition” protocols to secure its confidential documents.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq passed these observations during the hearing of the appeals of former prime minister Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi against their conviction in the cipher case.
A division bench comprising CJ Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb resumed the hearing on the appeals. Special prosecutors of the FIA Hamid Ali Shah and Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi appeared before the court. Justice Farooq inquired how old were the codes for the cipher and auxiliary documents.
The lawyer responded that some of the documents were from 2003 and a few of dated back to the pre-partition era and amended in 1964. The booklet on cipher was updated in 2003, he said, asking the court to examine the case in the light of security protocols, physical possession of the classified cable, and statement of witnesses.
The bench asked whether Mr Qureshi was also facing the charges of misplacing the cipher and asked the prosecutor to explain the case in sequential order.
As he explained the requirements for keeping the document in secure custody, the prosecutor argued that Mr Khan did not return the copy. Justice Aurangzeb questioned if the prosecution took any action against those who did not return the cipher on time. The prosecutor replied that he would respond to this question at the next hearing. The court adjourned the hearing till April 30.
