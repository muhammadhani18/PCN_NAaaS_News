0,"Xi tells Blinken US, China must be 'partners, not rivals'","Chinese president says happy to see thriving US, hopes it can also look at China's development in positive light","President Xi Jinping has said that China and the United States should be partners rather than rivals; help each other succeed rather than hurt each other; seek common ground and reserve differences, rather than engaging in vicious competition; and honour words with actions, rather than saying one thing but doing the opposite.
“I proposed mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation to be the three overarching principles. They are both lessons learned from the past and a guide for the future,” Xi told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a meeting in the Chinese capital on Friday.
China is happy to see a confident, open, prosperous and thriving United States, and hopes the United States can also look at China's development in a positive light, the Chinese leader said.
“This is a fundamental issue that must be addressed, just like the first button of a shirt that must be put right, in order for the China-US relationship to truly stabilise, improve and move forward,” he added.
Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, Xi said over the past 45 years, the relationship has gone through winds and rains, and it has a number of important inspirations to offer.
At present, transformation not seen in a century is unfolding in a profound way, and the international situation is fluid and turbulent. It is the shared desire of both the two peoples and the international community to see China and the United States strengthen dialogue, manage differences and advance cooperation, President Xi said.
""I've said many times that the planet is big enough to accommodate the common development and respective prosperity of China and the United States,"" Xi said.
President Xi recalled his meeting with American counterpart Joe Biden in San Francisco last year, when they launched the San Francisco vision that is future-oriented. In the last couple of months, the two teams have acted on the common understandings of the two heads of state, maintained communication in various areas, and made some good progress.
“But there are still issues to be addressed which require further efforts. Your visit this time was agreed upon between President Biden and I in our phone call several weeks ago. I hope you will find it productive,” he added.
Secretary Antony Blinken also met with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi for several hours in closed-door meetings at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse where the two tried to maintain progress in ties despite a broad and complex agenda.

As they settled into their opening session, Wang told Blinken that the ""giant ship"" of the China-US relationship had stabilised, ""but negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building"".
""And the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. China's legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges,"" he said.
Blinken replied that ""active diplomacy"" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Biden and President Xi when they met in San Francisco in November.
""There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy,"" Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that ""we're as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations"".
Blinken and Wang met in a guesthouse which is part of a sprawling complex of villas, lakes and gardens where many foreign dignitaries, including the then-US President Richard Nixon, have been received.
Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that China's attitude has always been consistent. China views and develops China-US relations from the world vision of building a community with a shared future for humanity.
China adheres to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, and commits to promoting the stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-US relations.
US State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China’s support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.
They have said that such assistance risks hurting the broader China-US relationship, even as ties stabilise after being hit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and the US downing of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon in February 2023.
Despite increasing high-level exchanges and working groups tackling issues such as enhanced military communication and global trade, stark differences remain.
Todd Robinson, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, and Nathaniel Fick, ambassador-at-large for cyberspace, are among the officials and envoys accompanying Blinken.
Wang laid out China's position, saying the US must not step on ""red lines"" covering sovereignty, security and development interests - an apparent reference to Taiwan, the democratically-governed island that China claims as its own, and the disputed South China Sea.
Wang said China urges the US side not to interfere in China's internal affairs, suppress China's development, or cross China’s red lines when it comes to China's sovereignty, security, and development interests.
Ahead of the talks, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also signalled that the Biden administration was not taking any options off the table to respond to China's excess industrial capacity.

1,"Ex-PM deliberately kept cypher copy, IHC told","Prosecutor says except Imran, all other officials had returned document","The Islamabad High Court was informed on Thursday that the cipher copy was returned by all the recipients except the then-prime minister Imran Khan, who lost the document therefore the case was lodged against him.
During the hearing of appeals of Imran and then foreign minister Shah Muhammad Qureshi in the cipher case, the prosecutor urged the two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb to see whether or not the cipher copy had reached the accused.
The cipher case originated from Imran Khan's public display of a paper during a rally in Islamabad on March 27, 2022, claiming it as evidence of an ""international conspiracy"" before a vote of no-confidence led to his government's ouster.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) initiated its probe into the so-called “cipher-gate” on July 19, 2023, after the previous coalition government announced an official inquiry against Imran and his close associates for violating the Official Secrets Act (OSA).
Imran was arrested on August 5, following his conviction in the Toshakhana case by a local court of Islamabad. Later, he was also arrested in the cipher case on August 29. On January 30, a special court convicted Imran and Qureshi and sentenced each of them to 10 years in prison under the OSA.
During the hearing of the appeals in the IHC, the bench raised the question that when the cipher case was registered, many other people also did not return the copies. Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Special Prosecutor Hamid Ali Shah replied the rest of the officials had returned the cipher copies.
Regarding the former prime minister, the prosecutor said that the authorities knew that he had lost the cipher copy. The former prime minister deliberately kept the cipher copy and negligently did not return it, the prosecutor argued.
The chief justice pointed out that the charges of not returning the cipher copy wilfully and its negligent loss could not be made simultaneously. Special Prosecutor Shah said that when the cipher came to the then-prime minister, he deliberately kept it to himself and showed negligence by not returning it.
About the prosecution’s charge that said that Imran made the cipher public, the chief justice inquired as to what was made public, saying that the cipher was not on the court record. Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb asked as to where the recipient of the cipher document was.
The FIA prosecutor said that he would assist the court on this point later. However, he stressed that the cipher was a classified document, entailing accountability. He added that the cipher copy was sent so that he read this document and instructed about necessary action.
The FIA prosecutor told the court that he would complete his arguments in three to four hearings. After which the hearing was adjourned till April 30.

2,PM launches Shuhada Package for civil servants,Shehbaz resolves to eliminate smuggling,"Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday launched the Shuhada Package to support the families of the federal government officials martyred in the line of duty, comprising cash assistance, housing allowance as well as free education and medical treatment.
The prime minister, who visited the family of late Customs Inspector Syed Hasnain Ali Tirmizi, who was martyred in a firing incident in Dera Ismail Khan a few days ago, handed over a cheque under the Shuhada Package to the grieved family and assured his government’s all-out efforts for the security of the customs officials serving to purge the country of smuggling.
Offering Fateha for the martyred soul and sympathizing with the bereaved family, he said that the Shuhada Package, earlier announced by the Punjab government, had now been extended to the federal government and could be revised further considering the country’s financial position.
Under the package, the family members of a martyred sepoy would get Rs10 million cash assistance and Rs13.5 million housing allowance, besides free education and medical treatment. The family of a martyred customs inspector would be entitled to a Rs15 million cash and Rs25 million housing allowance along with free education and medical facilities.
The package will also apply to civilian officials, police, and law enforcement agencies, the prime minister said who was accompanied by Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, PML-N leaders, and senior government officers.
He said the Federal Board of Revenue, law enforcement agencies, and the interior ministry were in cohesion to curb the menace of smuggling through collaboration with the provincial institutions.
“The elimination of smuggling is as essential as the recovery of the national economy. Economic stability cannot be achieved without curbing the smuggling. This is my foremost responsibility as well as of my government,” he remarked.
He also thanked Army Chief General Syed Asim Munir, the the KP government, the provincial chief secretary, and the Inspector General of KP Police for their support in the federal government’s endeavor against smuggling so that people could use their produce and the country could earn foreign exchange through exports by legal means.
“I want to tell the federal and provincial government representatives that smuggling is our common enemy and we have to fight this out… Let us pledge not to spare any effort to curb smuggling to save billions of dollars for the national economy. If we set this goal, Allah will grant us success otherwise, we will be questioned on the day of judgment,” the prime minister remarked.
Energy reforms
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday chaired a high-level third and final meeting to review reforms in the power sector.
During the meeting, important decisions were taken about the transmission system of electricity and distribution companies.
The prime minister approved in principle reforms and restructuring of the electricity transmission system especially the reform and reorganization of the National Transmission and Despatch Company.
He formed a committee to finalize the recommendations for ensuring the implementation of reforms and reorganization in this regard.
He also set up a cell in the Prime Minister's House to ensure the implementation of reforms in the power sector. The cell would closely monitor the whole process.
He sought a report on the project of his last government which was aimed at replacing high power consumption fans with low power usage fans.
He also sought a comprehensive plan to provide low-consumption power fans to low-income consumers and another plan to provide electricity to the industrial sector at low rates.
The PM said he himself would chair the monthly review meeting on the power sector reforms. He directed that industries should be provided electricity at lower tariff to ensure economic progress and increase exports.
""Reforms are not possible in the government departments without a system of reward and punishment,"" he added.
During the meeting, participants were informed in detail about issues and reforms of the National Transmission and Despatch Company, and different suggestions were presented.
Recommendations were also presented regarding the power distribution companies, their losses, privatization, and outsourcing.
The meeting was also informed about tariff rationalization and power tariffs for industries and domestic consumers.
Different suggestions were put forth for the utilization of electricity for cooking by domestic consumers instead of gas.
Also, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was committed to empowering youth with modern technology and providing them with the latest vocational training.
He was speaking at an event organized by the Ministry of Information Technology on the occasion of International Girls in Information Communication Technology (ICT) Day, to recognize the contribution of female entrepreneurs in the field.
He said, “It is our hope and we expect that youth will become entrepreneurs and open offices in cities like Karachi, Lahore, and in other places in Pakistan and other countries like Saudi Arabia and information technology will become the biggest foreign exchange earner for Pakistan.”
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday held a meeting with a delegation led by Chief Executive Officer of APM Terminals and Board Member AP Miller Mearsk Keith Svendsen and discussed matters related to business and investment.

3,Opposition alliance not against army: Achakzai,Clarifies opposition parties have come together to save the country,"Mahmood Khan Achakzai has clarified that the newly formed alliance of opposition parties—Tehreek Tahaffuz-e-Aain—is not cobbled together to spread hatred against any state institution, including the army and spy agencies.
“We have no differences with the army. We acknowledge that no country can operate without the help of its spy agencies,” Achakzai said on Thursday while talking to the media after chairing a meeting of the alliance in Islamabad.
Achakzai, representing PkMAP, was elected earlier this month as head of the six-party alliance also comprising the PTI, the JI, the SIC, the MWM, and the BNP-M. The Thursday meeting in Islamabad was also attended by representatives of the parties—including PTI’s Omar Ayub, SIC’s Hamid Raza, and MWM’s Nasir Abbas.
Achakzai said, “We want to clarify that this alliance was not formed to spread hatred against any institution. It has been created to save Pakistan. Because the country is going through its most dangerous period at the moment, and it can only be saved from crises through social consensus.”
He said it has been decided to appoint the PTI as the coordinator of the alliance.
Speaking on the occasion, Omar Ayub said the alliance will hold a protest on Friday (today) against the government formed on the basis of “Form 47” and alleged rigging in by-elections in Punjab.
“We will stage a protest against the illegal detention of our workers and leaders, including PTI founder Imran Khan. On May 5, we will stage a rally in Karachi, and on May 10, we will hold a public meeting in Faisalabad. We will continue this protest throughout the country,” he said.
SIC’s Hamid Raza said the fake government in Punjab had already initiated a crackdown against the opposition through the ruthless police chief of the province.
“The authorities have made lists of political workers and started detaining them even before our protest. Since yesterday, more than 15 parliamentarians' houses in Faisalabad have been raided.
“I will inform the federal interior minister and the Punjab inspector general that political workers are used to such things, but those who lay hands on women in our houses will have their hands cut off.”
He said the opposition had tolerated the provincial government’s coercive measures so far but would hold their protest come what may. “We will not allow any further brutality in any case. Such barbaric behavior has never been seen before. This law of the jungle will not last long,” he said.

4,Pakistan rejects Indian remarks about AJK,Islamabad says ties with Washington robust,"Pakistan on Friday rejected provocative statements by Indian leaders regarding Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), warning that such inflammatory rhetoric posed a grave threat to regional peace and stability.
Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told a regular weekly briefing that a surge had been witnessed in such statements recently. She rejected all unwarranted Indian claims and urged the Indian politicians to cease the practice of dragging Pakistan into their internal discourse aimed at gaining electoral advantage.
“We are witnessing an alarming surge in provocative statements from Indian leaders, asserting unwarranted claims over Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan rejects these claims. Fuelled by hyper-nationalism, this inflammatory rhetoric poses a grave threat to regional peace and stability,” she said.
“We urge Indian politicians to cease their reckless practice of dragging Pakistan into India’s populist public discourse for electoral motives. Historical and legal facts as well as ground realities refute India’s baseless claims over Azad Jammu and Kashmir,” she added.
“Despite India’s rhetoric and assertions, Jammu and Kashmir remains an internationally recognised disputed territory. India would be wise to help implement these [UN] resolutions instead of harbouring delusions of grandeur.”
The spokesperson also condemned the ongoing vilification, stigmatisation, and victimisation of Muslims and other minorities in India. To a question, Baloch said currently, there was no back-channel diplomacy going on between Pakistan and India to normalise bilateral trade.
The Foreign Office said Pakistan was confident its ties with Iran won’t affect the relationship with “friends and partners”, including the United States, stressing the country “does not believe in zero-sum” relationships.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi undertook a three-day visit to Pakistan recently and both countries agreed to deepen their cooperation in diverse areas, including expediting talks on a free trade agreement as well as the gas pipeline. The US has repeatedly warned Pakistan of potential risks of getting close to Iran.
Baloch insisted that Pakistan did not believe in zero-sum relationships. “Expansion of our relations with one country should not be considered as coming at the expense of our relationship with another,” she stressed.
“Pakistan is confident that its relationship with its friends and partners, including the United States, are robust enough to move forward on their own merit, and notwithstanding any other relationships that Pakistan has with other countries in our national interest,” she added.
She noted that Pakistan had trade relations with its neighbour Iran. “And we have, as I mentioned earlier, we have a preferential trade agreement between Pakistan and Iran. The border regions of Pakistan and Iran benefit from local trade and this trade takes place mostly in barter form.”
“You would recall, there are border markets, these are sustenance markets to help local traders. This basically helps the economy of the poor regions along the border of Pakistan and Iran,” the spokesperson said.
She added that Pakistan and the United States have a robust dialogue and several channels of communication, and Islamabad would continue to engage with them and explain the importance that Pakistan accords to its relations with its neighbours and the need for this cooperation so as to have the Pakistan-Iran border, as a border of peace, security and prosperity.
On the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project, the spokesperson said Pakistan would pursue the project in its own national interests. “Pakistan has energy needs. Pakistan will take decisions on the basis of its national interest in fulfilling its energy requirements, taking into account the international environment, taking into account the UN sanctions, if any, and issues relating to trade with other countries, including in the energy domain,” she said.
The multibillion dollar project is again in the spotlight after Pakistan recently agreed to start work on its side of the border. The US has warned that the project runs the risk of triggering sanctions.
Pakistani officials, however, are adamant that the question of sanctions would arise only once the pipeline is connected with Iran. At this stage, officials say, Pakistan is only laying the pipeline on its side of the border.
Meanwhile, Pakistan voiced grave concerns over the discovery of mass graves at two major hospitals in Gaza that shocked the human conscience. “Pakistan joins the call by the United Nations for “a clear, transparent and credible investigation” of mass graves and the massacre of men, women and children by the Israeli occupation forces. Pakistan vehemently condemns Israel’s barbarianism and its war crimes against the people of Gaza,” she said.
“We underline the urgency of an unconditional ceasefire to protect civilians from further carnage. An independent and impartial investigation must be held to ascertain the facts, fix responsibility and punish the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.”
“We urge the international community, especially the backers of Israel, to take urgent measures to bring an end to the war on the people of Gaza, to lift the siege, to protect civilians, facilitate humanitarian assistance and to hold to account the perpetrators of the Gaza genocide,” the spokesperson said.

5,CJ shies away from full court on judges letter,Uncertainties persist over decision to form the bench under the Supreme Court Practice,"Despite hinting at forming a full court to hear suo motu notice pertaining to alleged meddling by the country’s security apparatus into judicial affairs, a three-judge committee constituted under the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act 2023 has constituted a six-member larger bench to hear the case.
The startling letter by six Islamabad High Court judges to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) had kicked off a flurry of activities.
Signed by Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the IHC, the March 25 letter was addressed to the chief justice of Pakistan, SC’s Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar, as well as the chief justices of the IHC and Peshawar High Court.
The Supreme Court on Thursday released its cause list according to which a new six-member larger bench, headed by CJP Qazi Faez Isa, would take up on April 30 the suo motu case of the six IHC judges penning a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) alleging that the country’s intelligence agencies were interfering in their adjudication.
The other judges on the new bench include the same ones -- Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Athar Minallah, Musarrat Hilali, and Naeem Akhtar Afghan -- with Justice Yahya Afridi being the only exception.
Earlier on April 3, a seven-member larger bench led by the CJP had taken up the matter. However, Justice Yahya Afridi later recused himself from hearing the case.
The remaining six judges -- CJ Isa, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Musarrat Hilali, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan -- are part of this bench. A copy of the court roster is available with The Express Tribune.
The roster has been issued by the order of the committee constituted under Section 2(1) of the SC Practice and Procedure Act.
Under the law, the committee comprises three judges, namely CJP Isa, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, and Justice Munib Akhtar.
Interestingly, the court roster has been issued from Karachi with the signature of SC Registrar Jazeela Aslam.
It is unclear as to whether the committee made the decision on the formation of the larger bench unanimously or with a majority.
When the case was fixed on April 3, it was mentioned in the cause list that all available judges were part of the larger bench.
Even during the first and sole hearing of the case, CJP Isa hinted that the full court could be formed. Interestingly, Justice Minallah, in his separate note, referred to the full court several times.
Lawyers, who are backing the six IHC judges’ stance, have been expressing their disappointment over the absence of a full court, urging the committee members to reconsider their decision.
It will be interesting to see if the bench will defuse the matter and give guidelines for the future.
The CJP has made it clear that he did not receive a single complaint of executive interference during his tenure.
On the other hand, PTI leaders have been complaining of manipulation of judicial proceedings in matters related to them, especially those pertaining to the party’s founding chairman Imran Khan.
Moreover, the PTI chief has already expressed mistrust of IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.
In a repeat of history, PML-N leaders Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz were convicted just before the 2018 general elections while Imran Khan was handed down conviction before the 2024 general elections.
Like Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz’s conviction in the Panama cases, apprehensions were cast over the way Imran was convicted in three cases during trials that were run in Adiala Jail before the elections. There are serious questions for not following the due process during his trials in cases.
The superior judiciary led by CJ Isa has failed to end the perception that a political leader, whose relations with the powerful circles, are tense, is being awarded convictions. That was what happened in the Panamagate scandal and the same is happening with Imran Khan now.
All eyes are on the larger bench as to how it will secure the six IHC judges from any kind of harassment in the future. The chief justice himself is a victim of a witch-hunt after his decision in the Faizabad Dharna case. There are reports that one section within the government is considering a judicial reform package through a constitutional amendment.
The outcome of every important case will be judged through the lens of the proposed judicial reforms.

6,Social media trolls can’t derail progress: COAS,Gen Asim says economic stability essential for complete independence,"Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir said on Friday that negative propaganda and social media trolls could not distract the nation from advancing towards the development and prosperity of Pakistan and its people.
Addressing a Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI) conference, General Asim asserted that the unwavering support of the armed forces, coupled with the collective resolve of the nation, would thwart all adversarial forces seeking to hinder Pakistan's progress.
He urged the populace to unite in rejecting the influence of these detrimental elements, emphasizing the imperative of resilience and unity in the face of such challenges.
“We are all a united team Pakistan – Inshallah with the cooperation and support of the people, all efforts by those who distract and obstruct Pakistan’s development journey will fail.""
He emphasised that the negative propaganda and social media trolls could not distract the nation from working for the development and prosperity of Pakistan and its people, warning that no attempt to create instability would be tolerated.
”In today’s era, complete independence without economic stability is not possible, whereas no instability would be tolerated in Pakistan’s journey towards prosperity and development. Let us all reject negative forces together and focus on Pakistan’s journey of development and stability,” he said.
The GPI conference was also attended by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, besides the civil and military officials, involved in this national undertaking, according to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations.
The media wing of the military said that the forum was briefed about the multi-faceted GPI initiatives aimed at ensuring food security and enhancing agricultural productivity in Pakistan and the significant benchmarks achieved in a short span of time.

The initiatives presented on the occasion, included establishment of model farms, water management schemes, technology innovations and investment partnerships. Gen Asim said that Pakistan was blessed “with an industrious and resilient nation which needs to come together” for national development.
“COAS assured that Pakistan Army will continue to provide all possible support for the economic development of Pakistan and underscored that the Army’s efforts would contribute towards comprehensive national security and collective good of the nation,” read the ISPR press release.
The federal ministers, while concluding the session, lauded this transformative initiative and underscored that agriculture was the lifeline of Pakistan. They hoped that the GPI would introduce contemporary best practices in Pakistan’s agriculture sector, the ISPR stated.
In July last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had inaugurated the GPI along with the army chief, which aims at bringing investment worth billions of dollars in the next four to five years in the agriculture sector of Pakistan.
Shehbaz had said that the initiative would be the second green revolution, paving the way for prosperity and progress in the country. Under this programme, the government anticipated an average investment of $30 to 50 billion over the next three to four years.
