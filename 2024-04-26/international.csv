0,Court overturns Weinstein’s conviction,"Case led to launch of #MeToo movement accusing men in entertainment industry and 
politicians of sexual misconduct","NEW YORK: Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned on Thursday by New York’s highest court, reopening the landmark case that launched the #MeToo movement and highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men accountable. 
In a 4-3 decision, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting women testify that Weinstein assaulted them even though they were not part of the charges he faced. 
Arthur Aidala, a lawyer for Weinstein, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He told the New York Times that the decision upheld “the most basic principles” that criminal defendants should have at a trial. 
The court also said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined in a way that portrayed him in a “highly prejudicial” light. 
“It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behavior that destroys a defendant’s character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges,” Judge Jenny Rivera wrote for the majority. 

Case led to launch of #MeToo movement accusing men in entertainment industry and 
  politicians of sexual misconduct

“The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial,” she added. 
In a sharp dissent, Judge Madeline Singas said the decision “perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence and allows predators to escape accountability”. 
She also accused the majority of “whitewashing the facts” and continuing a “disturbing trend” of overturning jury verdicts in sexual violence cases. 
Former comedian Bill Cosby saw his 2018 sexual assault conviction overturned three years later by Pennsylvania’s highest court. It said a 2005 agreement not to charge Cosby with drugging and assaulting a woman meant he should not have been charged a decade later. 
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose predecessor Cyrus Vance brought the case, will have to decide how to proceed against Weinstein. 
“We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,” Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, said in an email. 
Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year prison sentence, after being convicted in February 2020 of sexually assaulting a former production assistant in 2006, and raping an aspiring actress in 2013. 
#MeToo movement
Weinstein’s conviction in New York was considered a milestone for #MeToo, in which women have accused hundreds of men in entertainment, media, politics and other fields of sexual misconduct. 
“Today’s decision is a major step back in holding those accountable for acts of sexual violence,” said Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer who represented eight of Weinstein’s accusers. “It will require the victims to endure yet another trial.” 
Weinstein co-founded the Miramax film studio, whose hit movies included Shakespeare in Love and Pulp Fiction. His own eponymous film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018.

1,Tabloid publisher says he killed stories to hide Trump’s affairs,Pecker says he signed an agreement with Trump’s lawyer to assign the rights to former model's story to a shell company.,"NEW YORK: Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified at Donald Trump’s criminal trial on Thursday that he worked out a deal that would allow Trump to buy the silence of a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with him, but called it off.
Pecker, 72, said he signed an agreement with Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to assign the rights to former model Karen McDougal’s story to a shell company that would hide the fact that Trump was paying for it. He said he called off the deal after speaking with a company lawyer.
“Michael Cohen said, ‘The boss is going to be very angry with you.’ And I said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m not going forward, the deal is off,’” Pecker testified. “He was very angry, very upset, screaming, basically, at me,” Pecker said of Cohen.
Pecker is a key witness in the case against the former US president, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment to another woman who said she had a sexual encounter with Trump, porn star Stormy Daniels.
Pecker testified that he told Cohen that Daniels was looking to sell her story in the weeks before the November 2016 election. He said he was frustrated that the Enquirer’s parent company, American Media, had already paid thousands of dollars to bury other stories that were unflattering to Trump.
“I thought it should come off the market, and if anyone was going to buy it, Michael Cohen and Donald Trump should buy it,” Pecker said.”  Pecker said Cohen pressed American Media to buy Daniels’ story, but Pecker testified he did not want to be involved with a porn star.
Prosecutors say Pecker, who has not been charged with a crime, engaged in a conspiracy with Trump and Cohen to corrupt the 2016 election by suppressing unflattering stories that might hurt Trump’s candidacy. Pecker testified that after McDougal told his editor that she had a yearlong affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007, he advised Trump to buy her silence.
Pecker said he told Cohen he did not want the Enquirer to pay for the story, as it had already paid $30,000 to buy the silence of a Trump Tower doorman who claimed Trump had fathered a child of out wedlock, which turned out not to be true.

2,Blinken lands in Beijing for tough negotiations with Chinese leaders,BEIJING: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on Thursday on the United States and China to manage their...,"BEIJING: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on Thursday on the United States and China to manage their differences  “responsibly” as he landed in Beijing for tough talks with the rival power’s leaders.
Blinken is expected to address a range of thorny issues including Chinese support for Russia and its treatment of Taiwan, with China likely to raise trade concerns such as new US action against popular social media app TikTok. Blinken headed straight to a closed-door gathering with leading Chinese scholars on Thursday.
On Friday a full day of talks with China’s political leadership is planned, including a possible meeting with President Xi Jinping. Blinken arrived from Shanghai, where the top US diplomat attempted a charm offensive that saw him sample local food, watch a basketball game and stroll along the city’s famous Bund promenade.
Visiting the local Communist Party leader in a room with sweeping views of the Shanghai skyline, Blinken said US President Joe Biden was committed to  “direct and sustained” dialogue between the world’s two largest economies after years of mounting tension.
“I think it’s important to underscore the value — in fact, the necessity — of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,” Blinken said.
“We have an obligation for our people — indeed an obligation to the world — to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly.” The Chinese Commu­nist Party secretary for Shanghai, Chen Jining, welcomed Blinken partly in English and spoke of the importance of US businesses to the city.
“Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity,” Chen told him. Blinken also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, where he voiced hope for more Americans to study in China. He insisted the United States was committed to welcoming Chinese students.
Beijing has repeatedly alleged that Chinese nationals with valid travel documents, including students, have been subject to aggressive interrogations and deportations at US airports.
“President Biden and President Xi are determined to strengthen our people-to-people ties,” Blinken said. He also met US business leaders, telling them that the two countries needed to make sure the  “economic relationship is working in the ways that it should work to mutual benefit”.
Blinken, the first US secretary of state to visit Shanghai in 14 years, opened his visit on Wednesday evening at a restaurant serving steamed buns before going to watch a basketball match between the Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls. Such softer diplomacy, once a staple of US-China relations, would have been unimaginable until recently, with hawks in both countries speaking of an emerging new Cold War.

3,DR Congo accuses Apple of using ‘blood minerals’ from war-torn east,Tech giant warned of legal action by DRC if practice continues.,"PARIS: The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has accused Apple of using “illegally exploited” minerals extracted from the country’s embattled east in its products, lawyers representing the African country said on Thursday.
The DRC’s lawyers have sent Apple a formal cease and desist notice, effectively warning the tech giant it could face legal action if the alleged practice continues.
The Paris-based lawyers for the DRC accused Apple of purchasing minerals smuggled from the DRC into neighbouring Rwanda, where they are laundered and “integrated into the global supply chain”.
Contacted by AFP, Apple pointed to statements from its 2023 annual corporate report regarding the alleged use of so-called conflict minerals that are crucial for a wide range of high-tech products, “Based on our due diligence efforts… we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG (tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023, directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,” it said.

Tech giant warned of legal action by DRC if practice continues

The DRC’s mineral-rich Great Lakes region has been wracked by violence since regional wars in the 1990s, with tensions reheating in late 2021 when March 23 Movement (M23) rebels began recapturing swathes of territory.
The DRC, the UN and Western countries accuse Rwanda of supporting rebel groups, including M23, in a bid to control the region’s vast mineral resources, an allegation Kigali denies.
“Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave human rights violations,” the DRC’s lawyers wrote.
Sexual violence, armed attacks and widespread corruption at sites providing minerals to Apple are just some of the claims levelled in the letter.
Macs, iPhones, and other Apple products are “tainted by the blood of the Congolese people”, the DRC’s lawyers said.
Formal notice
French lawyers William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth sent the formal notice this week to two Apple subsidiaries in France and lawyer Robert Amsterdam to the tech company’s US headquarters.
“Apple has consistently relied on a range of suppliers that buy minerals from Rwanda, a mineral-poor country that has preyed upon the DRC and plundered its natural resources for nearly three decades,” they wrote.
The DRC is rich in tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold - often referred to as 3T or 3TG - all minerals used in producing smartphones and other electronic devices.
The tech giant’s efforts to ethically source its minerals are “notoriously insufficient”, said Bourdon and London-based Amsterdam.
“Apple seems to rely mainly on the vigilance of its suppliers and their commitment to respect Apple’s code of conduct,” reads the official letter.
But both their suppliers and external audits appear to rely on certification from the Tin Supply Chain Initiative (ITSCI), “which has been shown to have numerous and serious shortcomings,” said the formal notice.

4,Venice launches five-euro entry fee,Visitors entering the Unesco World Heritage site for the day have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket.,"VENICE: Venice launched a new scheme on Thursday to charge day-trippers for entering the historic Italian city, a world first intended to ease the pressure of mass tourism — but many residents are opposed.
Visitors entering the Unesco World Heritage site for the day have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket, with inspectors carrying out spot checks at key entry points.
Considered one of the most beautiful cities on the planet, Venice is one of the world’s top tourist destinations — but is drowning under the weight of the crowds.
Around 10,000 tickets had been sold by the time the scheme began at 8:30am on Thursday, according to Simone Venturini, the local councillor responsible for tourism.
Under a trial system, the  “Venice Access Fee” is being introduced on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July. Thursday is a public holiday in Italy. There is no limit to the number of tickets available. Instead, the goal is to try to persuade day-trippers to visit during quieter times.
“I think it’s good, because it will perhaps slow down the numbers of tourists in Venice,” said Sylvain Pelerin, a French tourist who has been visiting for more than 50 years. Overnight visitors, who already pay a tourist tax, will be exempt, as will minors under the age of 14 among others.
But not everyone is happy, with some residents set to protest against a measure they say curbs fundamental rights to freedom of movement.
“This is not a museum, it’s not a protected ecological area, you shouldn’t have to pay — it’s a city,” Marina Dodino from the local residents association ARCI, said.
Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has said the new scheme is  “an experiment”, monitored with  “very soft controls” and  “without queues”.

5,Israeli land grabs spike in West Bank amid Gaza crisis,"According to Israeli settlement watchdog, Peace Now, this year has already broken a record for most ""land grabs"", which often lead to the expansion of settlements.","JIFTLIK: While feeding his sheep pricey fodder, Palestinian farmer Talib Edais wistfully glanced at the hills where his herd used to graze for free. This was up until an Israeli decision, last month.
“Do you see these troughs? We had to sell some sheep to feed the others. Within a year, we will not have any sheep left,” the 65-year-old told journalists at his farm, in the village of Jiftlik, near the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank.
Israeli authorities declared 8,000 dunams (800 hectares), as state land in March. The land in question is adjacent to Edais’s home and is an area that includes his sheep’s grazing grounds. These moves often lead to restrictions placed on Palestinians’ access to the lands.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967 and established settlements deemed illegal under international law and has for decades, seized land in the Palestinian territory.
According to Israeli settlement watchdog, Peace Now, this year has already broken a record for most ‘land grabs’, which often lead to the expansion of settlements.
The advocacy group revealed that 10,971 dunams of land in the occupied West Bank, have been seized by Israel, this calendar year. This has occurred as the world’s attention has been focused on the devastating Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip, which began on October 7. The previous yearly record, according to Peace Now, was 5,200 dunams seized in 1999.
When an area is declared as state land, it makes the Israeli government its owner. Technically, this should not affect farming or other uses of land, until the lot is reallocated for development or handed over to private owners.
However, Peace Now found in 2018 that “99.76 percent of state land allocated for any use in the occupied West Bank, was allocated for the needs of Israeli settlements”.
From the land near the Jordanian border that Edais and 50 of his relatives have resided on since 1976, the farmer can see the nearby settlement of Masua and an Israeli army base. Before the Israeli order to seize the land had even taken effect, he said settlers ‘captured’ his sheep, claiming the animals had entered an ‘off-limits area’.
To retrieve them, his family was made to pay 150,000 shekels (about $39,500), to the Jordan Valley Regional Council. This is an administrative body of about two dozen settlements, including Masua.
Rights groups have denounced the increasing use of such tactics, ‘encouraging’ Palestinian displacement from lands, yearned for by settlers.
The Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civil affairs, COGAT, and the office in charge of state lands, did not respond to repeated requests by reporters for comment.
Hamad Audi, a 55-year-old construction worker living in Jiftlik, told reporters’, what happened to Edais, came as ‘no surprise’. “The law is in the hands of the settlers, and the state (Israel) stands with them,” Audi said.
According to him, plenty of houses in the village have been ‘handed’ demolition notices by Israeli authorities, with one already demolished.
In March, 206 dunams (51 acres) bordering Jiftlik, were declared as a state-owned archaeological site and placed under the authority of the Jordan Valley settlement council.
The area is a rocky mound, where a former British Mandate-era prison and an Ottoman-era building stand. It is now inaccessible to Palestinians, living right next to it.
Around 490,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, alongside three million Palestinians. While settlements have consistently expanded under successive Israeli administrations, “in the last year we’ve seen a lot of developments”, said Yonatan Mizrahi, director of settlement watch for Peace Now.
Israel’s government, formed less than a year before the Gaza debacle began, includes extreme-right parties that support settlement expansion and politicians who call for the annexation of the West Bank.
To Audi, Palestinian life in the area is in danger.“I expect that the population of the entire Jordan Valley area will be displaced,” he said.
According to Mizrahi, many Israelis believe that “the Jordan Valley should be in Israeli hands no matter what”, owing to its geographical location as a buffer zone between the West Bank and Jordan. It is important to note that Israel had penned a peace deal with Jordan, in 1994.
Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley, many of them farm-based, “have very little power”, Mizarhi added.

6,Pro-Palestinian US campus protests grow as police start crackdown,"Over 200 protesters arrested at universi­ties in Los Angeles, Boston and Austin.","

AUSTIN (Texas): Law enforcement personnel detain a pro-Palestinian protester at the University of Texas in Austin. Over 200 people have been arrested as protests against Israel’s invasion of Gaza spread to more than a dozen campuses in the United States on Thursday.—Reuters

 
LOS ANGELES: Pro-Palestinian protests spread to more college campuses in the United States on Thursday as authorities appeared to be running out of patience and police carried out large-scale arrests.
Students at some of the country’s most prestigious universities have staged occupations over the growing human toll of Israel’s aggression in Gaza. Sit-ins and boisterous demonstrations, including a new one that sprung up at the University of California, Los Angeles, are calling for colleges to sever ties with Israel and with companies they say profit from the conflict.
“For 201 days, the world has watched in silence as Israel has murdered over 30,000 Palestinians,” said a message posted online by organisers of the UCLA protest.
“Today, UCLA joins students across the country in demanding that our universities divest from the companies which profit off of the occupation, apartheid and genocide in Palestine.” More than 200 protesters were arrested on Wednesday and early Thursday at universities in Los Angeles, Boston and Austin, Texas, where a fresh rally was scheduled for midday.

Photographs and video from Emory College in Atlanta showed police wrestling with protestors on neatly manicured lawns. The spreading protests began at Columbia University in New York, where a midnight deadline was approaching for students to remove an encampment that has become the epicentre of the movement.
Visiting the campus on Wednes­day, top Republican leader House Speaker Mike Johnson condemned the nature of the protests and suggested it could be necessary to bring in the National Guard — a controversial statement in a country that saw Guardsmen shoot and kill protesters at Kent State University in 1970.
Arrests and campus closures
The protests pose a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance campus commitments to free expression amid complaints that the rallies have crossed a line.
Student protesters say they are expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where the death toll has topped 34,305, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.
Demonstrators, including a number of Jewish students, have disavowed instances of anti-Semitism and criticised officials equating it with opposition to Israel. 
Demonstrations also flared at the University of Southern California’s (USC) Los Ange­les campus, where 93 people were arrested for trespassing on Wednesday and at the Uni­versity of Texas (UT) in Austin, where 34 were arrested, according to authorities.
USC said on social media site X at around midnight that the protest had ended and the campus would remain  “closed until further notice.”  “Students, faculty, staff and people with business on campus may enter with proper identification,” the university said.
Los Angeles police officers went to the campus on Wednesday afternoon and  “assisted the university in effecting trespass arrests” when protesters refused to leave, Captain Kelly Muniz told reporters. The LAPD said there were no reports of injuries and patrols would remain in the area on Thursday.
At Emerson College in Boston, local media reported that classes were cancelled on Thursday after police clashed with protesters around 2am, tearing down a pro-Palestinian encampment and arresting 108 people.
Coast to coast
In Washington, students from Georgetown and George Washington University (GW) established their own solidarity encampment on the GW campus on Thursday morning, the Georgetown Voice student publication reported, with a walkout planned at Georgetown.
Protests and encampments have sprung up at universities from coast to coast, including at New York University and Yale — both of which also saw dozens of students arrested earlier this week — Harvard, Brown University, MIT, the University of Michigan and elsewhere.
On Sunday, US President Joe Biden denounced  “blatant anti-Semitism” that has  “no place on college campuses.” But the White House has also said that the president supports freedom of expression at US universities.
