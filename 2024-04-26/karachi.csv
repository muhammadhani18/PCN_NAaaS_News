0,Two men shot dead in Karachi,Central SSP rules out the possibility of a robbery bid behind the murder.,"KARACHI: Two men were gunned down in as many incidents in the city on Thursday, police said. 
Shahrah-e-Noor Jahan police said a shopkeeper, identified as 60-year-old Ghulam Mohammed, was shot dead in North Nazimabad, Block-U, Dir Colony.
Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi ruled out the possibility of a robbery bid behind the murder as he said that during the initial probe, it had transpired that the shopkeeper was gunned down by a drug peddler, identified as Tati Khan.
The SSP said that some days ago, a quarrel had taken place between the victim and the said drug peddler as the former had prevented the latter from taking narcotics near his shop. The police had reasonable doubts that he was involved in the murder, he added.
The deceased was father of four children and originally hailed from Swabi.
In a separate incident, a man was gunned down while another wounded in the SITE area.
SITE-A police said that Sher Khan, 35, was shot dead while Irfan Fazal, 30, was wounded at Pathan Colony. The police attributed personal enmity behind the murder. The body and wounded were shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
Suspect held
Police on Thursday claimed to have arrested a suspect who shot dead his sister and her husband over ‘love marriage’ in the Moachko area recently.
Keamari SSP (Investigation) Tauheed Rehman Memon said Javed and his wife Deedar were gunned down while the couple’s infant daughter was wounded on April 7. The couple had married with their free consent four years ago and were living in Rais Goth.

1,Nasla Tower plot to be auctioned  to compensate demolition victims,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the officials concerned to auction the land, on which once Nasla...","KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the officials concerned to auction the land, on which once Nasla Tower was raised, after completing the normal practice in order to compensate the affectees. 
The 15-storey commercial-cum-residential building on Sharea Faisal was demolished on the directives of a bench headed by the then chief justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed for having been partially built on a portion of land meant for the service road. 
When a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa took up the matter for hearing, it was informed by some of the victims that despite the apex court order passed in June 2021 about compensation, the same had not been complied with. 
The advocate general of Sindh informed the bench that as per earlier orders of the apex court, after the demolition of the tower, the official assignee of the Sindh High Court had attached a portion of the allotted plot measuring 780 square yards in order to compensate the affected residents as the builder had passed away. 
The bench ordered the official assignee about auction of the land as per normal practice and also directed the Sindhi Muslim Cooperative Housing Society as well as the owners of demolished tower to provide details about ownership of the plot to the official assignee as well as other requisite documents within one week. 
The court also directed the official assignee to file a report after completion of the auction process about whether the amount was sufficient to compensate the victims. 
Initially, the apex court had ordered the demolition of the building in June 2021 for partly encroaching upon around 240 square yards of land meant for a service road and in September 2021 the review petition of the builder was also turned down.

2,"SC orders removal of all barriers from roads, footpaths in three days",CJP Isa says no one can be allowed to obstruct free movement of public.,"• CJP Isa says no one can be allowed to obstruct free movement of public
• Jinnah Courts building handed over to Rangers by Sindh govt, bench told                   
KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday took exception to placing barricades on pavements outside the headquarters of the Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, Chief Minister House, Governor House and other offices and directed them as well as others to remove such barriers and encroachments from the footpaths and thoroughfares across the city within three days. 
The apex court said that all the federal, provincial and local government entities and officials as well as private persons/organisations must also remove blockades and other encroachments from public places. 
A three-judge bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, said if the needful was not done within the stipulated period, the same would be demolished by the relevant authorities at the cost to be paid by the officials/persons responsible for such encroachments from their own pockets. 
It observed that encroachments were done by private persons/citizens on public spaces, but it was unfortunate that pavement and roads were also encroached upon by the government entities/officials as the footpaths were for the use of the general public only. 
The bench was hearing a petition filed by former city nazim Naimatullah Khan and a set of other connected matters at the apex court Karachi Registry on Thursday. 
The CJP noted that barricades had been placed at the pavements outside the Rangers headquarters on Ziauddin Ahmed Road, CM House, Governor House and several other places, and said that those barriers must be removed immediately since the same was restricting the free movement of public. 
The federal and provincial law officers submitted that such measures were taken due to security concerns. 
The CJP replied that the public continued to be attacked, but public servants wanted themselves to remain safe. If anybody, including the chief justice, was scared, then they should vacate their premises and sit at home, he further remarked. 
He also stated that in case of any security threat, such barricades and barriers might be placed inside the premises of respective government offices/buildings, but should not be on the pavements or roads. 
The CJP remarked that initially, barriers were also placed on the road outside the apex court building by police, but he immediately ordered removal of such obstacles, adding that no one could be allowed to obstruct free movement of the public. 
He also said that the authorities were asking the citizens/private persons to vacate public spaces, but on the other hand, federal and provincial government entities/officials were themselves occupying public spaces. The CJP made it clear that such double standard would not be tolerated. 
Many roads and pavements in the city had been encroached upon by the government functionaries and if the governments did not abide by law, how could they expect from people to do so, he asked. 
When the CJP inquired about the status of the Jinnah Courts, which is housing headquarters of the paramilitary force, the advocate general Sindh replied that the heritage building belonged to the Sindh government and was handed over to Rangers. 
The bench also expressed resentment over digging of pavement by power utility and said that such ditches were left open, causing inconvenience to the public. It also deplored the dilapidated condition of several thoroughfares of the city. 
The bench also directed its office to forward that order to federal and provincial authorities and local administrations as well as landowning agencies through the federal and provincial law officers for compliance.

4,Garbage in storm water drains causes flooding in Karachi: experts,"Likelihood of floods has increased by 30 times due to climate change, meteorologist says.","KARACHI: Massive encroachment of storm water drains across the city and lack of a system for their periodic cleaning throughout the year were identified as major reasons for flooding in the city by experts at a programme held on Wednesday. 
The event on urban flooding was organised at the Climate Action Centre (CAC). 
During the discussion, the panellists including experts in hydrology, meteorology and urban planning emphasised that the root causes of Karachi’s flooding must be identified to implement effective prevention strategies. 
Speaking about climate change, Chief Meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz said that the rising global temperature by 1.2 degrees Celsius had significantly increased the intensity of floods in the world, especially in vulnerable countries like Pakistan that saw devastating floods in 2022 when one third of the country was submerged. 

Likelihood of floods has increased by 30 times due to climate change, meteorologist says 

“In fact, the likelihood of such devastating floods has increased by 30 times due to climate change,” he warned.
Other speakers highlighted shortcomings in Karachi’s infrastructure and planning that had made the city so vulnerable that a significant section of the city got flooded even by light rain.
Hydrologist Sana Adnan noted that the current practice of cleaning storm drains only before the monsoon season was a major reason for flooded roads, though it’s common knowledge that heavy rains could occur anytime of the year.
According to her, Karachi needs a comprehensive master plan for storm water management including complete separation of storm water drainage from the sewerage system and properly designed storm water system in areas where it doesn’t exist.
“We need proper and permanent profiling of all roads to support the overland flows towards drainage nullahs and drains and ensure that all encroaching infrastructures constructed over drains and outfall pathways are removed,” Ms Adnan said.
She also emphasised the need for restoring drains and channels to their original capacity, implementing a comprehensive solid waste management system from primary to secondary collection system and then final disposal of waste at landfill sites that should be provided outside the city.
“Karachi generates 20,000 tonnes of solid waste per day but only 3,000 tonnes to 4,000 tonnes of waste is picked up. The city’s population has grown dramatically but its solid and drainage system hasn’t been upgraded to meet the needs of a growing city,” she said, adding the city had a large unregistered population.Govt plans lack adaptation strategies
Most participants raised the concern that though the province of Sindh had a separate directorate for climate change as well as a policy on the phenomenon, its manual on planning and development had no mention of climate change adaptation. Hence, the government projects didn’t include strategies and action plans for implementation.
That’s why storm water drains, a participant pointed out, were not periodically cleaned and the finance department released funds for the task just before the monsoon season.
It was also stated that the city had over 3,000km long network of drainage but the Karachi Water Sewerage Services and Improvement Project would cover only 160km of the system.
Expert on urban planning Bilal Khalid underscored the urgent need for a well-defined administrative plan based on modern principles.  He stated, “Karachi faces multifaceted challenges and it will remain vulnerable to any climate disaster unless a comprehensive and strategically designed plan is implemented.”
Director CAC Yasir Darya also spoke.

5,CM lauds TCF efforts for educating underprivileged students,"Says alumni from foundation’s schools now serving in prestigious institutions, MNCs","KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Thursday said that underprivileged students from The Citizens Foundation (TCF) had successfully qualified for admissions to prestigious universities and many of them had also passed the CSS exams and were currently working in national and multinational companies. 
“The motto of the TCF ‘Quality education for the less privileged’ has had and is having an immense impact on our society,” the CM said while speaking at a programme titled “Greatness of Spirit in Karachi: Book Launch & Magsaysay Laureate Reunion,” which was organised by the TCF in collaboration with the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation (RMAF) at a local hotel. 
Mr Shah appreciated the TCF’s journey from five schools to nearly 2,000 schools across the country in the urban slums and rural communities. 
“The Sindh government has given its 500 schools to TCF for their outstanding results,” he said and added that he was very pleased to know that the TCF students were qualifying for admission in prestigious universities and some of them had completed MBA from IBA and LUMS and qualified for CSS exams and Fulbright scholarships and were now serving both in national and multinational companies (MNCs). 

Says alumni from foundation’s schools now serving in prestigious institutions, MNCs 

The CM expressed his admiration for the RMAF for initiating that prestigious award which was now considered an `Asian Noble Prize’ in the field of public service. He also said that it was heartening to know that the RMAF award was given regardless of nationality, religion and ethnicity. 
The Ramon Magsaysay Award, Asia’s premier prize and highest honour, recognizes the greatness of spirit shown in selfless service to the people of Asia regardless of race, gender or religion.
There have been 13 laureates from Pakistan of the award until now which are Henry Holland and Ronald Holland, Akhter Hameed Khan, Abdul Sattar Edhi and Bilqis Bano Edhi, Shoaib Sultan Khan, Asma Jahangir, Syed Adibul Hasan Rizvi, Tasneem Ahmed Siddiqui, Ruth Pfau, Ibn Abdur Rehman, The Citizens Foundation (TCF) and Muhammad Amjad Saqib.
The Chairperson of the RMAF Cecilia Lazaro hailed the Ramon Magsaysay Awardees from Pakistan as true heroes, acknowledging their unwavering dedication to fighting injustice and serving humanity with hope and optimism.
RMAF President Susanna B. Afan, through an online message emphasised the collective spirit of the awardees. “Their greatness of spirit is evident to address problems of human development, to forge partnerships, foster collaboration, and amplify their impact on a scale previously unimaginable,” she said.
Ahsan Saleem, chairman of the TCF, shared that it was a non-profit organisation set up in 1995 by a group of citizens.
“TCF is now one of Pakistan’s leading organisations in the field of education for the less privileged. The TCF model focuses on providing quality education through purpose-built schools. The organisation strives to ensure gender balance in its classrooms. To magnify its impact, and improve enrolment and quality of education, TCF is now adopting government schools across Pakistan,” he said.

7,Court grants bail to man who ran over motorcyclist in Clifton,KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Thursday granted bail to a man who had knocked down to death a young motorcyclist...,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Thursday granted bail to a man who had knocked down to death a young motorcyclist by a fast-moving pickup truck in Clifton near the Abdullah Shah Ghazi shrine.
The investigation officer (IO) of Boat Basin police station brought the suspect, Ali Abbas Narejo, before Judicial Magistrate (South) Rijhoo Mal and requested that the suspect was no longer required for further interrogation.
During the court proceedings, the IO informed the court that the suspect had confessed to his crime during interrogation. He added that the pickup had been impounded and needed to undergo a Motor Vehicle Inspection (MVI).
The IO also informed the court that the suspect’s driving license also needed to be verified from Hyderabad.
However, the court granted bail to the suspect against a surety bond in sum of over Rs6.7 million on the grounds that the offences included in the FIR were bailable.
In its order, the court said: “The offences 320 [unintentional murder by rash or negligent driving], 427 [causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees] of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) are bailable in nature as per [second] schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), hence at the first instance the accused asked to furnish solvent surety in the sum of Rs67,57,902, adding that “ the amount equivalent to the value of Diyat as prescribed under Section 323 PPC.”
The court also ruled that if the suspect failed to furnish a surety bond he would be sent to prison, and directed IO to submit challan report until May 8.
According to the FIR, the case was registered on the complaint of the father of the victim, who stated to police that he had received a phone call from an ambulance driver who informed him that near the Abdullah Shah Gazi shrine, a white car with registration number GPA-883 had been involved in an accident with his son, who was being taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in critical condition.
Furthermore, when the victim’s father reached the hospital, he learned that his son’s death was caused by injuries to his head and face when the car had knocked him down.

The investigation officer (IO) did not want to get extended the physical remand of the suspects identified as Sub-Inspector Sanaullah, Darakhshan SHO Ali Raza Leghari and Writing Head Constable Faisal Leghari.
After the proceeding held inside the judge’s chamber, the IO told Dawn that upon the court direction, he had recorded the statement of the neighbours of the victim, Moiz Naseem. 
According to him, they mentioned that on April 15, former SP Nayyarul Haq, main suspect in the custodial death of Moiz, had visited their place multiple times and asked for a digital video recording (DVR) footage from one of them on the pretext of monitoring the activities of a gang operation in the area and took the footage with him.
On the other hand, advocate Sanaullah Panhwar, counsel for SHO Ali Leghari, claimed that the departmental inquiry conducted by the police concluded that the former SP Nayyar, along with his guards, was implicated in taking Moiz out the police station in a black car.
The counsel also emphasised that if Moiz had died within the premises of the police station, his client could be held accountable. However, the recommendations outlined in the inquiry report deemed former SP Nayyar responsible for his death.
According to recommendations of an enquiry report compiled by DIG-West Irfan Ali Baloch: “SP Nayyar is responsible not only for the arrest of Moiz, but also for taking him out of the police station overnight during which Moiz died. Later, he (Nayyar) also tried to manage the post-mortem report of the deceased without timely informing the senior command. This puts the responsibility of the murder of Moiz on the shoulders of SP Nayyar who should be included in the investigation in case.”
The report also added: “The SHO of Darakhshan failed to inform seniors about the incident, resulting in the escalation of events, which could have been avoided if the SHO had timely communicated to seniors. Moreover, he was not present at the police station, and left for home instead of probing what was happening at his police station. This makes him liable for a departmental action.”

9,Court throws out plea of Aseefa’s rival candidate against rejection of his nomination papers,"HYDERABAD: A division bench of Sindh High Court, Hyderabad circuit, has dismissed a constitutional petition filed by...","HYDERABAD: A division bench of Sindh High Court, Hyderabad circuit, has dismissed a constitutional petition filed by Ghulam Mustafa Rind to challenge rejection of his nomination papers for NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad-I, which was also contested (and later won) by Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari. Mr Rind, in his petition had also sought a stay order against her oath-taking.
The petition was originally filed in SHC’s principal seat but was transferred to the Hyderabad circuit and placed before the division bench comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Tunio and Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed. The bench rejected it through an order authored by Justice Tunio. 
According to the order, the petition had been repeated after its “dismissal as not pressed unconditionally”. He prayed the court to set aside the March 29 notification issued by the returning officer concerned.
Mr Rind had also prayed the court to set aside the earlier (March 28) order passed by the Election Tribunal regarding Wapda dues outstanding against him and to reject respondent Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari’s of form-34 for NA-207 issued to her by the returning officer. 
He sought court’s directive to the returning to accept his nomination papers and enlist his name as contesting candidate [for the Feb 8 elections].
Justice Tunio observed in his order that the basis of instant and previous petition remained identical. After announcement of Feb 8 general election schedule by Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) the petitioner filed his papers to contest elections from NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad-I against which objections were filed. 
The RO considered objections and his nomination papers were rejected. He noted that the petitioner had questioned RO’s order before Election Tribunal which decided it on March 28, directing the RO to accept papers of the petitioner for NA-207 subject to payment of electricity dues by the petitioner.
Simultaneously, he further noted, the petitioner filed a petition wherein his relief was same and upon election appeal being allowed his counsel under instructions did not press the petition which was dismissed on April 3 with no stipulation or express permission for its re-institution or even for filing of subsequent petition on the same grounds and for the same relief.
The court asked petitioner’s counsel to satisfy court how could the petition be entertained after an earlier one had been dismissed and the petitioner had been granted relief conditionally in election appeal by him which he could not avail. 
The court said: “No proper answers were given besides grounds available in petition being reiterated which, we may add, were substantiated by no evidence”.
Deputy Attorney General Parkash Kumar submitted in court that the subsequent petition was not maintainable. 
Additional Advocate General Allah Bachayo Soomro and Assistant AG Sindh Rafiq Ahmed Dahiri agreed that the petition could not be instituted after the earlier one was dismissed.
The court said that respondent-7 [Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari] had already been declared elected unopposed and sole returned candidate by the ECP through a notification dated April 1 and she had taken oath as MNA. 
The court said after taking remedy from Election Tribunal the petitioner failed to clear his dues and only stated that now that reference number of bill was allegedly incorrect.
“This oversight is something he ought to have checked even before going to Election Tribunal which will have been appropriate time to address it as well. Suffice it to say that he slept on the matter until results of election came knocking. More, the petitioner was not accompanied by any proof of any manner to show that reference number of utility bill was incorrect. It is for these reasons that the instant petition is dismissed in limine by us through short order dated April 24,” said order.

10,Women Action Forum questions probe into ‘harassed’ girl’s suicide in Hala,Says the victim had been under constant stress as she suffered harassment and insult at the hands of officials in the college administration.,"HYDERABAD: The Women Action Forum (WAF) has raised questions over impartiality of a departmental committee formed by education department to probe suicide on April 18 by a physically challenged laboratory assistant posted at government girls’ college in Hala town.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the WAF said the inquiry should be conducted by those who were aware of human rights, women’s rights and anti-harassment law and demanded formation of anti-harassment committees in education department to stop recurrence of such incidents.
It said the victim had been under constant stress as she suffered harassment and insult at the hands of officials in the college administration and she stated in her suicide note that she was ending her life over the administration’s attitude. 
WAF had tried to find out facts with the help of locals and police to learn about the circumstances leading up to her suicide. The victim’s heirs had not lodged any case and buried her without going for post mortem after recovery of her body from a canal, it said.
A four-member committee had been formed by the department to conduct inquiry into the harassment charges but WAF demanded a high-level inquiry instead of a departmental one, it said.                     
Since the departmental committee consisted of senior education officers therefore its transparency could become questionable, it said.
