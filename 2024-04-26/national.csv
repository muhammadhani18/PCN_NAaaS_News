0,MQM wants Centre to help curb street crimes in Karachi,NA witnesses protest over minister’s claim that issue comes under province’s purview.,"ISLAMABAD: Expressing grave concern over the security situation and rise in street crimes in various parts of Sindh, members of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) in the National Assembly on Thursday sought the federal government’s help to control the situation. 
“If the Sindh government has failed to establish its writ, what role is the federal government playing?” asked MQM’s Sabheen Ghouri while speaking on a calling-attention notice regarding an increase in “incidents of suicide bombings in different parts of the country and incidents of snatching and gunshots in Karachi, Hyderabad and Kashmore”. 
The MQM members protested against Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s response when he termed the matter a provincial subject under the 18th Amendment and asked them to raise the issue in Sindh Assembly where the party has significant representation. 
The minister, however, said the federal government was determined to eradicate terrorism and help the provinces improve their capacity-building to counter the menace as well as in the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) which was finalised after the terrorist attack on Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014. 

NA witnesses protest over minister’s claim that issue comes under province’s purview; Tarar says draft of National Counter Violent Extremism policy ready; PTI members outraged over travel bar on colleagues

Mr Tarar, who was responding on behalf of the interior minister, said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his visit to Karachi on Wednesday had discussed the Safe City project with Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and the latter had assured him that the provincial government would soon establish a Safe City camera network across Karachi. 
The minister disclosed that a draft of the National Counter Violent Extremism 2024 policy had already been submitted to the federal cabinet for approval. 
Pandemonium 
The house saw a rumpus due to the PTI members’ protest over the minister’s remarks when he accused the previous government of preferring talks with the Taliban militants, instead of implementing NAP. 
He held the previous PTI governments in Punjab and KP responsible for the resurfacing of terrorism in the country. 
Opposition Leader Omar Ayub took the floor and lodged a protest over the minister’s remarks, stating that people of KP had suffered the most because of terrorism. He recalled that the decision to hold negotiations with the militants was taken during an in-camera joint sitting of parliament which was also attended by the top military officials. 
Mr Tarar said following the 18th Amendment, it was the provinces’ responsibility to improve law and order, adding that the federal government was ready to assist them in this regard. 
Raising the issue, MQM’s Nikhat Shakeel regretted that several young people lost their lives during mobile phone snatching incidents in Karachi. If the Sindh police had failed in performing their duties, then what role the federal government was playing, she wondered. 
MNAs Rana Ansar and Sabheen Ghouri asked the federal government to announce a policy of paying compensation to the victims of street crimes. 
Syed Waseem Hussain, an MNA from Hyderabad, said 60 to 70 people lost their lives in three months during street crimes in Karachi. He said in the past, too, they had witnessed the prime ministers’ visits, formation of committees and JITs, but there was no improvement. He said the federal government could not absolve itself by merely declaring it a provincial subject. 
Travel bar 
The PTI members also protested over the inclusion of party legislators in the exit control list (ECL) and no-fly lists and asked the government to remove their names. They also protested over the information minister’s reply when he asked them for a list so that he could provide information to them. 
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan was of the view that instead of seeking the list, the minister should have provided them the required information. 
He said it was not difficult for the government to search the names of parliamentarians in the lists and remove them. 
The minister pointed out that the ECL contained the names of 4,842 people whereas 1,926 people had been placed on the PNIL (Provisional National Identification List) and both the lists had been prepared by the departments concerned following the legal procedure. 
The PTI members accused the government of placing their names on the ECL as part of the alleged ongoing political victimisation. 
Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah was apparently unable to run the house smoothly as on a number of occasions he was found helpless when lawmakers simultaneously started speaking, creating a fuss in the house. 
At the outset, the treasury and opposition members protested over the absence of ministers, particularly Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, as the house was to take up the issues related to his ministry. 
The NA will meet again on Friday morning.

1,SC moved for laws to ‘rein in’ spy agencies,"Petition argues that an open inquiry, probe, or investigation involving all stakeholders should be initiated before the full court of the SC.","ISLAMABAD: A petition was moved before the Supreme Court on Thursday to seek “enactment or amendments in relevant laws to rein in” the intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
Any proposed law should hold the intelligence agencies accountable for issuing any direction or narrative that amounts to interference in the independence and impartial working of the judiciary, says the petition moved by the additional secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Sardar Shahbaz Ali Khan Khosa.
The additional secretary of the SCBA has filed the petition following a perceived delay on the part of the association in submitting its suggestions to the Supreme Court, which was dealing with a case regarding a March 25 letter by six Islam­abad High Court (IHC) judges accusing intelligence agencies of meddling in judicial affairs.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to resume the hearing on April 30, and in its last order, it had expected responses from the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), SCBA, and high courts by April 25.
The fresh petition contended that during the hearing, the Supreme Court should impose penal consequences and punishments against persons or authorities found to be issuing illegal orders that amount to meddling in judicial matters.
The petition argued that an open inquiry, probe, or investigation involving all stakeholders — the victim high court judges, members of all bar councils, bar associations, and the general public — should be initiated before the full court of the Supreme Court, and the delinquents should be strictly punished in accordance with the law for violating the Constitution, laws, and interfering in judicial matters.
The petition contended that the chief justices of the high courts should be requested to suitably amend their respective rules in exercise of their powers under Article 202 and 203 of the Constitution to make it mandatory for judges of subordinate court, high court and Supreme Court, as the case may be, to promptly inform if any attempt was made by any person or department or official to influence any proceedings before them to chief justices of high courts, chief justice of Pakistan and Supreme Judicial Council within seven days of any such interference.

2,ECP restores PTI MNA in NA-81,"Bilal Ejaz won in the general elections with a clear margin of 8,000 votes, but lost in a controversial recount.","ISLAMABAD: The Ele­c­­tion Commission of Pak­istan (ECP) on Thursday restored victory notification of PTI’s Chaudhry Bilal Ejaz as MNA from NA-81, Gujranwala.
Bilal Ejaz won in the general elections with a clear margin of 8,000 votes, but lost in a controversial recount.
The ECP issued the victory notification pursuant to orders passed by the Lahore High Court.
Last week, the LHC had set aside the victory notification of PML-N leader Azhar Qayyum Nahra from NA-81 and restored the membership of Bilal Ejaz as MNA.
Justice Shahid Karim had passed the orders while allowing a petition filed by Bilal Ejaz challenging the notification for Azhar Qayyum’s victory.
The petitioner had approached the court against the ECP’s decision to declare Azhar Qayyum as the successful candidate from NA-81.
He submitted that he was declared successful from NA-81 by a margin of 8,000 votes, but the ECP illegally declared Azhar Qayyum successful in a vote recount.
He alleged that the returning officer had reduced his 2,500 votes in the recount.
He said the ECP could not order a vote recount after the formation of the election tribunal and requested the court to set aside the victory notification of Azhar Qayyum.
According to original results, Bilal Ejaz was declared winner with 117,717 votes, while the PML-N candidate finished as runner-up, securing 109,926 votes.

3,"After criticism, Malala reaffirms  support for people of Gaza",KARACHI: Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai has reaffirmed her support for the people of Gaza after criticism over her...,"KARACHI: Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai has reaffirmed her support for the people of Gaza after criticism over her decision to co-produce a Broadway musical with former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Dawn.com reported.
In an Instagram post shared on Wednesday night, she said she “wanted to speak today” because there should be “no confusion about my support for the people of Gaza.”
Her statement comes after news surfaced of her producing Suffs, a Broadway musical on the suffrage movement in the US alongside Clinton. The internet was awash with criticism, with many calling the activist a sellout, particularly for partnering with Clinton on the project.
Clinton, a former US first lady and secretary of state, wrote an op-ed for The Atlantic last November in which she argued against a complete ceasefire in Gaza. She has also defended Israel, labelling criticism of it by students “antisemitic”. 
“We have all watched the relentless atrocities against Palestinian people for more than six months now with anger and despair. This week’s news of mass graves discovered at Gaza’s Nasser and Al Shifa hospitals is yet another reminder of the horrors Palestinians are facing. It is hard enough to watch from afar — I don’t know how Palestinians bear it in their bones,” wrote Ms Yousafzai.
“We do not need to see more dead bodies, bombed shovels and starving children to understand that a ceasefire is urgent and necessary.”
The education activist added that she had and “will continue to condemn the Israeli government for its violations of international law and war crimes”.
“Publicly and privately, I will keep calling on world leaders to push for a ceasefire and to ensure the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid.”
Ms Yousafzai said she was against “any form of violence against innocent civilians, including the taking of prisoners and hostages” and expressed solidarity with the people in Gaza “whose voices and demands must be heard”.
“When we see alarming signs of genocide, we cannot wait to take decisive action. We must work together to urge our leaders to stop these war crimes and hold perpetrators to account.”
Ms Yousafzai publicly made the statement after the news of her producing Suffs, a Broadway musical on the suffrage movement in the US, alongside the former US secretary of state.

4,Balochistan increases govt  job age limit to 43,"Lifts ban on transfer, posting in govt departments with immediate effect.","QUETTA: In a move to address unemployment and widen access to public service, the Balochistan government on Thursday raised the maximum age limit for applying to government jobs from 28 to 43 years.
The previous governments also increased the age limit to 35 and 38 years but later withdrew the orders.
Officials said the provincial government has decided to fill the vacant posts and create new posts in various government departments.
Meanwhile, the provincial government on Thursday also lifted a ban on the transfer and posting in government departments with immediate effect and changed some deputy commissions, assistant commissioners and other officials.

Lifts ban on transfer, posting in govt departments with immediate effect

The initial ban, mandated by the Election Commission of Pakistan after it released the schedule for the Feb 8 elections, aimed to ensure the transparency of the electoral process in the province by controlling the movement of key administrative officials.
After assuming office on March 2, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Ahmed Bugti, along with his 14-member cabinet, initially continued the ban, implemented on March 13, to maintain stability through the election period.
Officials said lifting the ban allows ministers to appoint departmental secretaries and other officers of their choosing, reflecting a shift towards normal governmental operations following the post-election transition.
The Service and General Administration Depart­ment (S&GAD) issued a notification on Thursday announcing the lifting of the ban on transfers and postings.
It said the chief minister had lifted the ban, imposed on March 13, on all kinds of transfer and posting in the entire province up to the pay scale BPS-21 with immediate effect.

5,Punjab CM Maryam’s uniformed appearance at parade causes a stir,Opposition criticises move; Punjab police say rules allow chief ministers to don uniform for formal occasions.,"LAHORE: Aiming for a 50-50 ratio of men and women in the police force, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif caused quite a stir on Thursday when she arrived at a passing-out ceremony for women constables and traffic assistants decked out in a Punjab police uniform.
Addressing the graduating class at Police Training College Chung, the chief minister said she envisioned a time when women would constitute half the police force, adding that she had directed the Punjab inspector general to increase the number of women police officers, who currently number around 7,000.

She expressed satisfaction that the training of women police constables had been conducted in line with best international practices and modern requirements, and told the graduating policewomen to always “take care of the oppressed and dispense justice”.
“After wearing the police uniform for the first time, I have realised that being a police officer or being sworn in as a CM is a very responsible job. In the chief minister’s office, we take decisions and you get them implemented,” she mused.

Opposition criticises move; Punjab police say rules allow chief ministers to don uniform for formal occasions

But the chief minister’s decision to attend the ceremony in full police regalia rubbed many the wrong way, especially the opposition PTI.
Opposition leader in National Assembly Omar Ayub, Yasmin Rashid, Moonis Elahi and Shahbaz Gill all criticised CM Maryam’s decision to don a police uniform.
The issue also remained among the top trends on social media, with many users questioning the logic behind the move.
However, others recalled that her father, Nawaz Sharif, had also made a similar gesture in the past when he was at the helm of affairs in the province.
 






A Lahore-based lawyer even went to the trouble of filing a petition before a sessions court, seeking the registration of a case against the Punjab chief minister for ‘impersonating’ a police officer.
But in the face of the criticism, both the PML-N and Punjab police defended CM Maryam’s actions.
“In the whole world, the head of the states can wear the uniform of their forces to enhance their respect. Nawaz Sharif did the same when he was in power and CM Maryam has followed him,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said in a statement.
Ms Bokhari said that by donning the police uniform, the chief minister had, in fact, increased the res­p­ect of the Punjab police, and advised her detractors not to be jealous.
In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), the Punjab police shared a copy of the relevant rules that govern how governors and chief ministers can dress on formal occasions.
 






As per the amended Punjab Police Dress Regulations, “chief minister may wear uniform on formal occasions like review of parades, while addressing police darbars, visiting police establishments or any such occasion as specified, for encouraging the police personnel and troops.”
“This has been widely celebrated by the police personnel, who view it as a commendable show of solidarity.  The Central Police Office has received hundreds of messages in which police personnel have lauded this step. Female police officers are celebrating the event and have shared various pictures of Madam CM Punjab in uniform,” the police department tweeted.
Talking to Dawn, a former inspector general of police also said that the chief minister had not committed any violation of the law by donning the police uniform.
“There has been a practice of nominating someone like cricketers, children etc as goodwill ambassadors of police, and that person also wears the uniform. Similarly, a DPO is authorised to declare anyone a special police officer,” he said, adding that only someone was liable for prosecution only if they put on a police uniform with the intention to deceive or defraud.

6,"Wait till next polls, MPA-elect asks rivals",ANP’s Piralizai rejects allegations of rigging in re-polling for PB-50,"QUETTA: ANP leader Zamrak Khan Piralizai, who emerged victorious in the April 21 re-polling for the Balochistan Assembly’s PB-50 Qila Abdullah seat, has advised the rival candidates to wait for five years to win the voters’ trust.
Addressing a presser along with ANP’s Vice President Malik Usman and Joint Secretary Rashid Khan Nasar on Thursday, he said voters reposed their trust in the ANP first on Feb 8 and now in the April 21 re-polling held on the Supreme Court’s orders.
Rejecting the PkMAP candidate’s allegations of rigging, he said, “We have once again won the hearts of people as we always serve them sincerely.”
Mr Piralizai claimed that Awami National Party had never compromised on the principles of Bacha Khan and Wali Khan for personal or political gains, and that’s why the people of Qila Abdullah expressed their trust in the ANP.
He said ANP achieved the success despite attempts by the opponents to sabotage the peaceful voting process. However, he added, the administration successfully controlled the situation.
