1,Evidence resurfaces of terrorists using leftover foreign weapons in Pakistan,"Pentagon says US delivered 427,300 weapons to Afghan military, of which 300,000 were left behind during withdrawal","Fresh evidence of 'foreign weapons', reportedly believed to have been transported from Afghanistan to Pakistan, has once again surfaced, adding to concerns over regional security and its purported link to an increase in terrorism within the country.
Pakistan's ongoing battle against terrorism, spanning two decades, has been exacerbated by the presence of weapons allegedly left by the United States in Afghanistan. This factor is believed to be responsible for the recent surge in terrorism in the country.
Since the beginning of the year, security forces have conducted a series of intelligence-based operations (IBO) in various districts, resulting in the elimination of several terrorists and the recovery of a cache of foreign weapons from them.
In Khyber district on April 24 to 25, a crucial operation took place targeting suspected terrorists.
The intense exchange of fire led to the killing of at least three militants, including prominent terrorist figures, Sohail, also known as Azmato, and Haji Gul alias Zarqawi.
Security forces also conducted an operation on April 22 and 23 in Balochistan's Pishin district. During the operation, three terrorists were killed while one was apprehended in an injured state, identified as an Afghan national.
Earlier this month, on April 6, security forces carried out an IBO in North Waziristan, resulting in the death of two terrorists.
Security forces confiscated a substantial quantity of weapons in recent operations. These include M16/A4 rifles, AK-47s, and other armaments.
Read Pakistan targets TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan
A foiled assault by Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists on the Gwadar Port Authority Complex took place on March 20.
In the course of the attack, the terrorists utilized foreign weaponry, which was later seized by security forces in their response.
In January, security forces engaged in operations in various districts, targeting militants who were attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan.
In Zhob district, seven terrorists were killed on January 22, with weapons seized that included M16/A2 rifles and AK-47s.
As per the Pentagon, the US delivered a total of 427,300 combat weapons to the Afghan military. At least 300,000 of them were left behind at the time of the US forces’ withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
This has resulted in an increase in terrorism in the region during the last two years.
Between 2005 and 2021, the US provided $18.6 billion in equipment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, the Pentagon said. After the US withdrawal, these weapons helped the TTP carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.
All these facts indicate that the Afghan regime is not only arming the TTP but also providing a haven to other terrorist organizations.
In response to recent terrorist incidents within Pakistan, the country has undertaken intelligence-driven anti-terror operations within Afghanistan. The operations targeted those responsible for attacks that claimed the lives of numerous civilian and law enforcement personnel.
Amidst the recent surge in terrorism, last month on March 20, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) issued a statement declaring the premier's firm stance of zero tolerance towards any cross-border attacks.

2,Insult to armed forces unacceptable: Vawda,Vawda takes stand against insult to border defenders and calls for systemic change in Senate address,"Senator Faisal Vawda emphatically declared on Thursday that insulting those who defend the country's borders was absolutely unacceptable.
Expressing his views after being sworn in the upper house, Vawda expressed his gratitude to his parents, the PML-N and the PPP for their support in his journey to become a senator.
He called for formulating rules in the Senate and emphasised the importance of ceasing disrespectful behaviour to others.

Vawda noted that the judiciary ranked 149th in the world because of the current prevailing “system”.
“If an affidavit applies to me, it will also apply to all judges and generals in Pakistan. If it is not currently applicable, we will ensure its application,” he said.
“We cannot move [forward] unless our system changes. Neither worker, nor leader or production order will be of any use unless the system is changed.”
He further questioned the “unlawful” marriage case against the PTI founder.
Vawda recalled that he was called to appear before the courts in the “name of law” when his mother was on the deathbed.
He questioned the hanging of PPP founder Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, saying after years they came to know who the “culprit” was behind the execution.
“Zardari saab was kept in jail for years. Under which law Nawaz Sharif and PTI founder’s governments were overthrown?” he asked. “Who will pay for the losses in Reko Diq [case]?”
Vawda said the country had suffered much, adding that they would “formulate laws and get it implemented”.
“[We] will not allow anyone to issue the certificate of sadiq (truthful) and ameen (righteous) from outside.”
Vawda maintained that it was his first day in the upper house, adding that he would not like to name people who were “playing on multiple fronts”. He called for exposing such individuals.

4,India votes in second election phase as Modi vs Gandhi contest heats up,Congress has denied the charges and said Modi fears losing and was using divisive language,"India began voting on Friday in the second phase of the world's biggest election, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his rivals raise the pitch of the campaign by focusing on hot-button issues such as religious discrimination, affirmative action and taxes.
Almost one billion people are eligible to vote in the seven-phase general elections that began on April 19 and concludes on June 1, with votes set to be counted on June 4.
Modi is seeking a record-equalling third straight term on the back of his economic record, welfare measures, national pride, Hindu nationalism and personal popularity. Surveys suggest he will easily win a comfortable majority.
His challengers have allied with more than two dozen parties and are promising greater affirmative action, more handouts and an end to what they call Modi's autocratic rule.
A total of 88 seats out of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament went to the polls on Friday, with 160 million people eligible to vote. They were spread across 13 states and federal territories in the world's most populous country.
More than half of the seats in Friday's contests were in the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka and the northwestern state of Rajasthan.
The campaign has become more heated since the first phase of voting on April 19 as Modi and the main opposition Congress party have faced off on communal issues with Modi accusing Congress of favouring minority Muslims, aiming to dilute affirmative action and planning to impose an inheritance tax.
Congress has denied the charges and said Modi fears losing and was using divisive language to distract voters from real issues such as unemployment, the price rise and rural distress.
But some voters were responding to the BJP.
""I will vote for BJP. Muslims will get a lot of benefits if Congress comes to power and I don’t want taxpayers' money to go for the benefit of any one community,"" said Shree Hari S.S., 23, who voted in the tech hub of Bengaluru.
Tackling unemployment, inflation and high taxation in the world's fastest-growing major economy, however, should be the priorities of the new government, said Kareemulla Basha, 47, a Bengaluru software engineer and a Muslim voter.
""When you promise something, see if it is fiscally prudent,"" he said. ""I am okay with subsidies, but the government should do a better job of finding a balance and understanding how much they will cost the exchequer.""
Rahul Gandhi in the fray
Rahul Gandhi, former Congress president and the face of the party, was among the 1,200 candidates in the fray on Friday.
""Your vote will decide whether the next government will be of 'a few billionaires' or of '140 crore Indians',"" Gandhi posted on X as voting began, referring to India's population of 1.4 billion.
""Therefore, it is the duty of every citizen to step out of their homes today and become a 'soldier of the constitution' and vote to protect democracy.""
Gandhi is seeking re-election from Wayanad in Kerala and faces Annie Raja of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and BJP's K. Surendran, among others, in the Left Front-ruled state.
In 2019, Gandhi defeated the CPI candidate by more than 400,000 votes, the highest margin in Kerala, although he lost his second seat to the BJP in the family bastion of Amethi in north India. India allows a candidate to contest from more than one seat but they can retain only one if they win from more.
Congress slumped to a historic low when it was swept out of power by the BJP in 2014 and won its second-lowest number of 52 seats in 2019, with Kerala contributing the highest tally of 15.
The party is expected to do better in Karnataka this year where it won just one of 28 seats in 2019 but gained strength and defeated BJP in state elections last year.
It is still seen to be struggling nationally as bickering within the opposition alliance it leads and graft cases against some leaders have hobbled its challenge to Modi.
The Election Commission and political parties have been worried about voter turnout due to the summer heat and wedding season in some parts of the country with turnout falling to around 65% in the first phase from nearly 70% in 2019.
While Bengaluru, which has faced an unusually hot summer this year, is forecast to touch a high of 37 degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit) on Friday, Mathura is expected to touch 41 degrees Celsius (106°F), weather websites showed.

5,"'Negative' factors building in US-China ties, foreign minister Wang tells Blinken",US eager to see more progress on curbing of China's supply of chemicals,"The United States is suppressing China's development, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday during talks with his US counterpart Antony Blinken who is on a visit to Beijing aimed at resolving trade and policy differences between the superpowers.
Secretary of State Blinken is due to spend several hours with Wang in closed-door meetings at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse as well as a working lunch, as the two sides try to maintain progress in ties despite a broad and complex agenda.
As the pair settled into their opening session, Wang told Blinken that the ""giant ship"" of the China-US relationship had stabilised, ""but negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building"".
""And the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. China's legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges,"" he said.
Blinken replied that ""active diplomacy"" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping when they met in San Francisco in November.
""There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy,"" Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that ""we're as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations"".
Blinken and Wang met in a guesthouse which is part of a sprawling complex of villas, lakes and gardens where many foreign dignitaries, including the then-US President Richard Nixon, have been received.
US State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China's support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.
They have said that such assistance risks hurting the broader China-US relationship, even as ties stabilise after being hit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and the US downing of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon in February 2023.
Despite increasing high-level exchanges and working groups tackling issues such as enhanced military communication and global trade, stark differences remain.
Hours before Blinken landed in China on Wednesday, Biden signed a bi-partisan bill that included $8 billion to counter China's military might, as well as billions in defence aid for Taiwan and $61 billion for Ukraine.
The disputed South China Sea also remains a flashpoint, while the US is eager to see more progress on the curbing of China's supply of the chemicals used to make fentanyl.
Todd Robinson, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, and Nathaniel Fick, ambassador-at-large for cyberspace, are among the officials and envoys accompanying Blinken.
Wang laid out China's position, saying the US must not step on ""red lines"" covering sovereignty, security and development interests - an apparent reference to Taiwan, the democratically-governed island that China claims as its own, and the disputed South China Sea.
Blinken is likely to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping today before he returns to Washington in the evening, although neither side has yet confirmed a meeting.
He is also meeting China's minister of public security, Wang Xiaohong.
Ahead of the talks, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also signalled that the Biden administration was not taking any options off the table to respond to China's excess industrial capacity.
Yellen told Reuters Next in an interview in Washington that China exporting its way to full employment is not acceptable to the rest of the world.

6,Govt mulls new initiatives to combat terrorism,"Tarar tells NA review of NAP under way, while cabinet mulling over ‘National Counter Violent Extremism Policy’","The government was reviewing the National Action Plan (NAP), focusing on conducting intelligent-based operations (IBOs), while the federal cabinet was deliberating on a new policy document to deal with extremism and the rising incidents of terrorism in the country, the National Assembly was informed on Thursday.
The government’s decision to review NAP came in the wake of recent attacks on the Chinese and other foreign nationals, almost a decade after the plan was enacted after the Army Public School (APS) carnage in 2014 in which more than 150 people, mostly minor students, were martyred.
After the APS attack, a national consensus was evolved to come down hard on terrorists.
Recently, the country had witnessed a surge in suicide attacks and terrorism incidents.
“National Action Plan is being reviewed,” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told the National Assembly.
The information minister also revealed that a “National Counter Violent Extremism Policy, 2024,” was also being deliberated upon, emphasizing that currently, the federal cabinet was discussing it and likely to give its approval soon.
In addition, the minister said, the government was focusing on the IBOs to curb the menace of terrorism. Emphasizing that the government was fully active in eradicating terrorism, Tarar said that full cooperation was being extended to all the provincial governments in this regard.
Reiterating that capacity-building work has already started, Tarar said that the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) was also being improved. He added that complete cooperation was being extended to the provincial government.
In addition, the information minister continued, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also talked about the safe city network in Karachi, during his recent visit to the metropolis to deal with the rising incidents of snatching and killings.
The minister expressed the hope that the federal and provincial governments, as well as all the law-enforcement agencies, were working together and soon the people would see a decline in terrorism incidents.
He shared all these details in response to a calling-attention notice about the increase in incidents of suicide bombing in different parts of the country and the increase in the incidents of snatching, and gunshots in Karachi, Hyderabad, and Kashmore.
The minister said that the former Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government didn’t hold any meetings to examine the implementation of NAP from 2018 to 2022. He recalled that a court had also inquired as to why no meetings were conducted during the PTI government’s tenure.
He said that the situation in Afghanistan and the outlawed Baloch organizations also contributed to the current state of terrorism in the country. “Negotiations were held with terrorists during the PTI regime,” Tarar continued, “the National Action Plan was stopped for talks with terrorists.”
In response to the statement, Opposition Leader Omer Ayub raised the objection, saying that an in-camera session on the security situation was held in the assembly hall, where the military leadership came and briefed the lawmakers about security issues.
Ayub said that the issues were discussed before everyone but misinformation was now being spread. Ayb stressed that people belonging to the PTI had also rendered sacrifices, adding that the record shouldn’t be distorted.
“I’m responding to a question by MQM-P [Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan] lawmaker regarding the law and order situation,” Tarar told the house. “Security is a provincial subject but the federal government is and will be giving full support to the provinces.”
About the announcement of compensation to the victims of these incidents, Tarar said that the federal government could not make such an announcement, because it would be an infringement on the provincial government’s rights.
MQM-P’s Syed Waseem Hussain then demanded the amendment to the 18th
Constitutional Amendment, “if the minister has to answer that security is a provincial subject every time a question is raised”.
Meanwhile, Ayub drew the interior minister’s attention to the non-removal of the names of some members of the National Assembly (MNAs) and the provincial assemblies (MPAs) from the travel stop list, Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) and Black List (BL).
Responding to the calling-attention notice, Tarar, while revealing that 4,800 people were on the black list and 1,109 on the PNIL, asked the PTI – now SIC – lawmakers to provide a list of the names. However, the opposition lawmakers were of the view that the government had all the lists.
Tarar again insisted for a list. The opposition again insisted that the government should do it by itself. Seeing a cat-and-mouse game, which consumed roughly half an hour, the deputy speaker intervened, saying that he would ask his office to take out the list of PTI lawmakers and give it to the government.
The house will meet again on Friday.

7,"200,000 metric tonnes urea import on cards",Tanveer says move necessary to avert shortage of fertiliser during Kharif season,"Federal Industries and Production Minister Rana Tanveer on Thursday recommended immediately importing 200,000 metric tonnes of urea to avert a shortage of the fertiliser during this year’s Kharif season.
According to a statement, Tanveer, who is also the national food security and research minister, was chairing a meeting of the Fertiliser Review Committee after analysing the consumption patterns, available stock, and future needs during the Kharif season 2024.
The minister pointed out that the demand for urea in this year’s Kharif season was 3.6% higher than the last one.
He explained that the expected demand for urea was around 3,442 metric tonnes for this year’s Kharif season.
However, he added that the available stock of urea in the country stood at around 3,192 metric tonnes, resulting in a shortage of the fertiliser during the season.
“To address this situation, 200,000 metric tonnes of urea will be imported, while the rest will be met by increasing production at the local fertiliser plants.”
The minister said all the urea plants in the country would remain operational at their full capacity to meet the local demand.
“The government is ensuring gas supply to the fertiliser industry for the benefit of the farmers.”
Tanveer noted that the purpose of importing urea was to ensure food security in the country.
In addition, he continued that the move would increase the farmer’s capacity for productivity and also bring about a significant reduction in the prices, stabilising the country’s urea market.
The statement read that the final decision to import urea would be made by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet during its next meeting.
Making matters worse, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) has recently projected a water shortage of up to 30% for the Kharif crops amid high system losses.
It warned that the shortage will be even higher at the time when farmers would be sowing cotton, rice and maize crops, and likely to drop to 7% late in the season.
The Kharif season runs from April to September. For the 2024 season, the water regulator has projected the availability of a total of 63.61 million acres feet (MAF) of water.
Out of this, Punjab will receive 31.13 MAF of water, Sindh 28.81 MAF, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 0.82 MAF and Balochistan 2.85 MAF.
The Irsa Advisory Committee (IAC) in meeting held earlier this month discussed water availability criteria for the Kharif 2024. It also estimated 13.67 MAF water losses during the season.
The IAC unanimously agreed on the data of expected inflows at the rim stations for early and late Kharif 2024.
 
The total inflows at rim stations were estimated at 99.41 MAF, out which 23.55 MAF inflows will be available early in the season and 75.87 MAF in late Kharif.

8,Fuel prices likely to be slashed on May 1,"Government expected to decrease petrol price by Rs4.88, HSD by Rs7.37 per liter","The rates of petrol and High-Speed Diesel (HSD) are expected to be reduced by up to Rs7.37 per liter due to a decline in international oil prices and premium rates, effective from May 1.
The federal government is expected to lower the price of petrol by Rs4.88 per liter and HSD by Rs7.37 per liter. The rate of kerosene oil is expected to be reduced by Rs8.03 per liter, and light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs5.37 per liter. The premium rate on petrol has fallen to $9.60 per barrel and remains steady at $6.50 per barrel for HSD.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) is scheduled to submit its recommendations to the Finance Division for petroleum product prices on April 30 for consideration.
The price of petrol is expected to drop to Rs289.06 from Rs293.94 per liter. The new price of HSD is likely to be Rs283.01, down from Rs290.38 per liter. The price of kerosene oil is expected to decrease from Rs193.08 to Rs185.05 per liter, and the LDO price is likely to drop to Rs168.97 from Rs174.34 per liter.
In the last fortnightly review of petroleum prices on April 15, the federal government raised the price of petrol by Rs4.53 per liter, and the price of HSD was increased by Rs8.14 per liter.
Smuggled fuel
Following the request of the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), the Petroleum Division on Thursday took up the matter with the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to take appropriate measures against smuggling of Iranian oil into the country.
The OCAC’s April 9 letter addressed to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and the Prime Minister's Office highlighted the issue of petroleum smuggling.
It stated that this smuggling poses a grave threat to forthcoming investments in refinery expansion and upgrading of projects under the Oil Refining Policy for Upgradation of Brownfield Refineries, 2023.
“This illicit activity not only bleeds the economy but also jeopardizes the opportunity for substantial investments in refinery upgradation. The ramifications extend beyond the refinery sector, impacting the profitability of oil marketing companies, dealers, and disrupting the White Oil Pipeline operations.
“Currently, refineries are carrying huge stocks of HSD due to the availability of smuggled fuel in the market. This situation is disturbing the entire oil supply chain,” the letter stated.

9,Dar offers olive branch to opposition,Faraz says they would have to move forward keeping in view past and present,"The upper house met on Thursday, during which Faisal Vawda and Maulana Abdul Wasay were sworn in as senators. Leader of the House Senator Ishaq Dar extended an olive branch to the opposition, urging cooperation with the government.
The Senate session was chaired by Yousuf Raza Gilani at the Parliament House.
As the session began, Gilani administered oath to Vawda and Wasay.
Addressing the house, Vawda expressed his gratitude to the PML-N and PPP for extending support to him.
The newly-sworn in senator maintained that he was ousted from the PTI for “showing mirror” to the party. He sought formulating rules in the upper house and stressed the importance of ceasing disrespectful behavior towards others. He added that the humiliation of those defending the country’s borders was unacceptable.
Taking a jibe at the judiciary, Vawda said it was after years that people came to know who the “culprit” was behind former premier Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s hanging.
“Zardari saab was imprisoned for several years. Under which law Nawaz Sharif and PTI founder’s governments were overthrown?” he questioned.
Vawda called for a “change in system”, saying unless it occurred, the workers, leaders and production orders would be of no use.
He further questioned the PTI founder’s ongoing nikah case in the court. “Even our bedrooms are not safe. What is the use of all these things?”
Leader of the House Senator Ishaq Dar offered Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz to work together with the government and urged him to join hands in taking the country out of the current crises.
He lamented that senators from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa were not present in the house, and added that he did not support the politics of revenge.
Faraz noted that PTI had the “highest number of political prisoners” in the country.
He said they would have to move forward keeping in view the past and present.
Faraz paid tribute to party founder Imran Khan and called for the issuance of production orders for PTI’s Ejaz Chaudhry, enabling his attendance at the upper house session.
“The entire nation knows how our government was overthrown. [Later] a caretaker government was established which oppressed our leadership,” he said.
“The interim set-up was illegally given such mandate which had no scope in Pakistan’s Constitution,” he added.
“Senators from Khyber-Pakhtunkwa are not in attendance in the upper house. This house considers itself handicapped. All these things are the violation of the Constitution.”
Later, the Senate chairman passed the ruling to constitute a special committee of the upper house to ensure smooth functioning of legislative business.
According to the ruling issued by the chair, in accordance with Rule 174 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, Senate committees are mandated to be formed within two months following the election of the chairman and the deputy chairman.
“As the House has entrusted me with this responsibility of Constitution of the Special Committee, I hereby constitute the Committee with the following composition:- (i) Senator Farooq H Naek (ii) Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister for law & Justice and Parliamentary Affairs (iii) Senator Syed Ali Zafar. The Committee will deliberate and present its report in the sitting of the Senate to be held on Monday, 29th April, 2024,” the Chairman Senate’s ruling said.
The process of constituting committees has commenced, with preferences from members being solicited to ensure alignment with their aspirations and the best interests of the house of the federation.
“The Constitution entrusts upon parliament the duty of meticulous examination and review of all financial matters, particularly those related to money bills, which hold significant implications for our country’s fiscal health and governance.
Within this framework, the Senate, as the upper house, assumes a pivotal role in conducting comprehensive scrutiny and analysis of financial legislation. The recommendations put forth by the Senate carry substantial influence in shaping the ultimate outcome of money bills,” the ruling said.
The Senate Rules encompass a thorough mechanism to ensure the fulfillment of the House and its members’ constitutional obligations.
“Rule 204 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, outlines the establishment of special committees to facilitate in-depth consideration of a matter. As per established parliamentary practice, special committees have historically been formed during Senate transitions every three years to ensure the continuity of the House’s business, even in the absence of regular committees,” it said.
Notably, special committees were constituted by the House during the tenures of former Chairmen Senate in the years 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2009, 2012, 2015 and so on, to deliberate on bills and other significant matters while regular committees were being formulated.
Continuing with the Parliamentary tradition, upholding the constitutional mandate and ensuring the smooth functioning of the legislative process, a special committee is being constituted to deliberate upon and scrutinize the money bill in question.
“I trust that all honorable members of this House will extend their full cooperation and support to this special committee in fulfilling its crucial responsibilities by the principles of parliamentary democracy and constitutional governance,” Gilani said.
