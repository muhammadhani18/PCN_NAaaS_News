0,Half-yearly auto sales remain sluggish,Analyst  attributed the decline in auto sales to weak demand and high prices.,"KARACHI: As the entire auto sector, barring tractors, faced a steep fall in sales ranging from 14 per cent to 56pc during the first half of 2023-24, the general elections on Feb 8 also failed to lift the sales of Toyota pickups, jeeps and SUVs.
Surging prices along with unprecedented interest rates turning car financing into a more expensive ride have continued to cast gloom on sales.
Total car sales plunged 56pc to 30,662 units during July-December FY24 from 68,912 units despite a slight rise in December 2023 sales to 4,916 from 4,875 units in November 2023. Sales during December 2022 were 13,780 units.
Honda Civic/City sales plunged to 3,938 units from 8,906 units, down by 56pc while Toyota Corolla and Yaris sales also fell 56pc to 5,279 from 12,065 units during 6MFY23.

Politicians’ favourite vehicles make no impression

Suzuki Swift sales shrank to 2,230 from 7,136 units depicting a drop of 69pc while Hyundai Elantra and Hyundai Sonata sales stood at 465 and 429 units in 6MFY24 from 1,282 and 560 units, down by 64pc and 23pc, respectively.
Suzuki Cultus and WagonR sales fell 63pc and 51pc to 1,908 and 1,829 units as compared to 5,143 and 3,769 units in July-Dec FY23.
Suzuki Bolan and Alto 660cc sales plunged to 1,179 and 13,405 units from 2,436 and 27,614 units, posting a fall of 52pc and 51pc, respectively.
Muhammad Tahir of Sherman Research attributed the decline in auto sales to weak demand and high prices despite assemblers’ efforts to improve sales through various sales strategies amid bumper crops and election year.
He said sales are going to recover owing to stable currency and ease in import restrictions in 2HFY24.
The arrival of completely knocked down (CKD) kits of cars and heavy vehicles swelled to $72m and $16m in November 2023 from $23m and $1.5m in October 2023 which improved production during December 2023.
Toyota Fortuner and Hilux sales remained subdued ahead of general elections showing a steep fall of 69pc to 1,919 in July-Dec FY24 from 6,242 in the same period last fiscal year. In December 2023 sales of these vehicles halved to 130 units from 263 in November 2023 while in December 2022 the sales were 944 units.

1,Govt fails to woo a single investor for solar project,"Official attributes the poor response to overall political uncertainty, macroeconomic conditions, country credit rating.","ISLAMABAD: In a major setback, no bid was received for setting up a 600-megawatt solar power project at Muzaffargarh despite multiple revisions in incentives and extensions in deadlines given by the Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — a one-window power sector entity of the federal government.
This was the first pilot project for the acquisition of renewable energy through international competitive bidding (ICB) in line with the projections under the long-term Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP). Multiple rounds of bidding were held and revisions in incentives were made since late 2022 under the already approved Framework Guidelines for Fast-Track Solar PV Initiatives 2022.
 
 

The last one-month extension in deadline was allowed on December 10 but not a single investor submitted a bid by Jan 11 deadline, confirmed an official of the PPIB.
He said no more extension or corrigendum was being considered for now and attributed the poor response to overall political uncertainty, macroeconomic conditions, country credit rating and the power sector’s risk factor because of the huge pile-up of payables to the private sector and the circular debt.
Early last month, the PPIB extended the bidding deadline asking the investors to come up with proposals and tariffs for setting up of 600MW Solar PV project at Kot Addu, Muzaffargarh on the build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) basis for a term of 25 years.
The bids were to be evaluated based on the lowest tariff and project completion timeline of about 26 months.
The government had approved in September 2022 a fast-track plan for the development of utility-scale large solar projects through private sector investment and was part of a major initiative of the federal government for the induction of about 10,000MW solar energy for cutting down carbon footprint, reducing foreign exchange exposure and bringing down overall electricity tariffs.
 
 

The bidding process for the 600MW project was launched immediately with the allocation of land and other facilities. Bidders did not show up for the first round ending May 31, 2023 under the benchmark tariff regime through reverse tariff competition against a benchmark rate of 3.4 US cents per unit. At the time, the PPIB claimed that the lower poor bidder response was because of the low project cost benchmarked by the regulator.
The benchmark tariff was thus removed by the government on the desire of the PPIB which also allowed investors higher interest rates and lucrative indexations against exchange rate variations besides longer project implementation schedules to facilitate investors so that the market could come up with true price discovery. However, this round also could not attract even a single bidder despite repeated extensions in bidding deadlines.
An official said that besides the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, lower country rating and power sector’s risk profile, the prevailing political uncertainty could be the biggest factor behind the poor investor response and the caretaker government was already receiving advisories for delaying the bidding deadline until the formation of a new government.
However, it was also not considered prudent to prolong the process indefinitely and instead leave it to the new government to go for a fresh round sometime in April-May. This could also allow a fresh look into G2G negotiations with friendly countries for solar capacity expansion.
 
 

The power sector circular debt as of Oct 31, 2023 had gone beyond Rs2.6 trillion and more than Rs300bn are payable to Chinese investors who had set up independent power plants under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
The country has around 45,000MW of installed capacity but capacity utilisation plummets below 9,000MW in peak winter mainly because of unaffordable electricity rates averaging beyond Rs45.

2,Sugar sector earns record Rs22bn on price spike,International sugar prices have also increased 45pc from $18.30 in October 2022 to $26.60 per pound in September 2023.,"KARACHI: The listed sugar sector’s earnings were up 78 per cent year-on-year to a record high of Rs22 billion in FY23 (Oct 2022 to Sept 2023) due to a rise in sugar prices that led to higher gross margins.
Ethanol, which is a by-product of sugar, also experienced improved performance in FY23 due to favourable selling prices in the international market along with the rupee devaluation.
Sunny Kumar of Topline Securities said that net sales of the sector jumped 29pc year-on-year to Rs304bn in FY23 due to the export of 249,000 tonnes and 28pc increase in average domestic prices in FY23.
The federal government allowed the export of 250,000 tonnes of sugar in January 2023, subject to the condition that proceeds in dollars would be recovered from sugar exporters within 60 days from the date letters of credit (LCs) were opened.
Opening up of exports has built pressure on domestic prices, leading to a 90pc increase in prices from Rs88 per kg in Oct-2022 to Rs166 per kg in September 2023. However, local prices have now declined and are currently at Rs147 per kg, he said.
International sugar prices have also increased 45pc from $18.30 in October 2022 to $26.60 per pound in September 2023. However, international prices have now declined and are currently at $21.40 per lb.
Average gross margins of the sector clocked in at 18pc in FY23 versus 15pc in FY22. Selling and distribution expenses rose by 38pc.

3,Concerns mount within FBR about ‘reforms’,"Tensions between Customs, Inland Revenue threaten collection.","ISLAMABAD: The proposed restructuring of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has heightened uncertainty within the field formation due to escalating tensions among tax groups concerning the nature and extent of the reforms, Dawn has learned from knowledgeable sources.
This uncertainty could potentially affect revenue collection, a concern that is particularly significant given the current political instability that has already strained the country’s economy. The FBR is struggling to recover its revenue collection, yet it remains on track to meet the target committed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 
 

On Nov 16, 2023, Caretaker Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar announced in Karachi that the customs will be separated from the Inland Revenue Services (IRS). This decision came as a big surprise for both tax officials and taxpayers, as they were not previously aware of this significant change.
Last week, the Special Investment Facilitation Council declared that it had authorised the proposal but had formed a ministerial committee to determine its legal obligations. The restructuring plan will receive final clearance in a cabinet meeting, according to a senior tax official, who added that everything is still a suggestion and nothing has been finalised.

Tensions between Customs, Inland Revenue threaten collection

Since the announcement, the divide between the tax groups—Customs and IRS—has deepened over the nature of the reforms. The IRS group believes that the changes have been proposed by a select few customs officers and are being backed by Ms Akhtar.
 
 

The proposed reforms are marked by three broad indicators— the establishment of three distinct boards to oversight the functions and policy formulation of the FBR. This reform will create a policy board to develop income tax, sales tax and federal excise duty policies. Private sector members will serve on this finance minister-headed body.
Two oversight and governance bodies will be established for the IRS and Customs. These boards will be chaired by the Finance Minister’s nomination, who may be an ex-tax official or specialist. These boards will also have members from the private sector. There will be no chairman of FBR, but rather a chairman of the boards. Currently, there is a National Tariff Policy Board which is chaired by the commerce minister.
Sources close to the development informed Dawn that the proposed reforms in the FBR structure were kept confidential. Most of the senior tax officials at FBR were not privy to the key features of these proposed reforms.
Dawn made multiple attempts to reach out to FBR Chairman Zubair Tiwana for his feedback but he didn’t pick up calls nor respond to messages sent on his cellphone. The FBR spokesperson also did not answer.
Director generals will replace present FBR members under reforms. Thus, IRS and Customs will have DGs. The tax collection structure and method will not change in the field formation.
An IRS senior official told Dawn that the finance minister had been briefed on the probable consequences of the planned oversight boards. The appointments of private sector members may lead to conflict of interest.
The minister was also warned of serious accountability difficulties. The official wondered who would keep private sector board members accountable.
 
 

The FBR Act empowers its members, and the current revisions propose giving board members comparable rights, which could cause governance concerns. No calculation shows that reforms will increase revenues, the minister was informed.
“The minister is not heeding our recommendations,” the official source said, adding that she will make a final decision with the cabinet before Feb 8 as caretaker minister.
The planned revisions also divide customs officials. Some officers feel a separate board will allow them to act independently of the IRS group chairman and board officers. Others support the current system with an emphasis on field formation and revenue collection integrity.

4,Govt borrows record Rs4.2tr,"Despite higher revenue collections, the government continues to borrow heavily from banks.","KARACHI: The government has set a record for borrowing from banks in the first six months of the current fiscal year, surpassing the total borrowing in the entire FY23. 
This intense borrowing has not only burdened the economy with debts but has also restricted the private sector’s access to banking funds.
According to the latest data from the State Bank of Pakistan, the government borrowed Rs4.284 trillion from banks during July-Dec FY24, exceeding the total borrowing of Rs3.716tr in FY23. 
In the first six months of FY23, borrowing was limited to Rs280 billion, showing substantial growth in the second half of the same year.
The banks in Pakistan have ample liquidity but are unable to utilise it, except for investing in government papers. The 22 per cent policy rate makes it impossible for the trade and industry to survive with these high returns on borrowed money.
In the auction held on Wednesday, investors offered Rs2.8tr to buy treasury bills. Mostly, banks invested in T-bills, reflecting high liquidity. At the same time, it also indicated that banks were eager to place their money in T-bills before the interest rate falls.
While there is no visible sign of an imminent interest rate reduction in the next monetary policy, analysts speculate about a potential rate cut. Some experts attribute the rate cut possibility to the inflation trend, which noted a 29.7pc increase in the CPI index in December 2023. 
However, the government borrowed just Rs283bn from the auction, leaving the situation open to speculation about the next policy rate. 
The government has been borrowing heavily during FY24 from banks despite higher revenue collections.

5,Sales tax e-invoices made mandatory,A sales tax notification was issued to enforce the decision from Feb 1.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has notified a list of registered businesses that will be required to submit their sales tax invoices electronically.
A sales tax notification SRO28 was issued to enforce the decision from Feb 1.
However, the affected businesses can apply for an extension if they can provide a valid reason to the commissioner of Inland Revenue.
The decision will apply to all importers and manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs), all wholesalers (including dealers), distributors of FMCGs, and all wholesaler-cum-retailers invol­ved in the bulk import and supply of FMCGs to retailers.

6,SBP reserves fall,Foreign exchange reserves dip $66 million during the week ended on January 5.,"KARACHI: The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) dipped $66 million during the week ended on Jan 5, 2024.
The central bank on Thursday announced that its foreign exchange holdings fell to $8.154bn due to debt repayments during the week. 
Pakistan is bound to arrange $24bn to meet external obligations during the current fiscal year. This outflow has kept the exchange rate under stress. 
However, the local currency continued its winning streak for the seventh consecutive session against the US dollar in the interbank market. The greenback lost two paise to close at Rs281.11 on Thursday. 
The country’s total reserves increased to $13.256bn, which included $5.101bn held by the commercial banks.

8,Stocks rally 698 points on rate cut hopes,Overnight T-bills indicate a market inclination towards an anticipated interest rate cut in the upcoming months.,"KARACHI: Snapping the five-session losing streak, bulls returned with a bang as hopes enlivened for a cut in the interest rate in the upcoming monetary policy review this month, tossing the benchmark KSE-100 index above the 64,000-point level on Thursday.
Topline Securities Ltd said investor optimism is fuelled by expectations of a positive outcome from the meeting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the second loan tranche of $700 million.
Additionally, overnight T-bills indicated a market inclination towards an anticipated interest rate cut in the upcoming months, evident from substantial participation as investors sought higher yields. The total participation reached around Rs2.75tr before the expected rate drop.
As a result, Mari Petroleum Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Oil and Gas Development Ltd, Habib Bank Ltd and Hub Power Company Ltd collectively contributed 406 points to the index.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said bullish activity was witnessed amid a slump in T-bill yields up to 59bps and upbeat economic data on home remittances surging by 13pc to $2.38bn in December.
“Surging exports, shrinking trade deficit and investor speculations ahead of major earning announcements due next week played a catalyst role in a bullish close at PSX.
The intraday high and low were recorded at 64,700 and 63,914 points. The KSE-100 index closed at 64,617.57 points after gaining 697.72 points or 1.09 per cent from the preceding session.
