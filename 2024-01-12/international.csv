0,Riots over pay cut kill 15 in Papua New Guinea,Prime minister declares a 14-day state of emergency in the capital.,"PORT MORESBY: Papua New Guinea’s prime minister declared a 14-day state of emergency in the capital on Thursday, after 15 people were killed in riots as crowds looted and burned shops.
Violence erupted in Port Moresby on Wednesday evening after a group of soldiers, police officers and prison guards launched protests over unexplained deductions to their pay.
Within hours the unrest had also spread to the city of Lae, about 300 kilometres to the north of the capital. “Today we call for a state of emergency for 14 days in our nation’s capital,” Prime Minister James Marape announced.
More than 1,000 troops were on standby  “to contain any situations that may arise going forward”, he said. At least 15 people were killed in the unrest in Port Moresby and Lae, said Police Commissioner David Manning.
Port Moresby’s largest hospital treated 25 people with gunshot wounds, according to figures, as well as six people with  “bush knife” lacerations. AFPTV footage showed looters in the capital dashing into stores through smashed glass windows, stuffing stolen goods into cardboard boxes, shopping trolleys and plastic buckets. One man was seen lugging an entire chest freezer away on his shoulders.
Buildings and cars were set alight, AFPTV footage showed, stirring up thick plumes of black smoke that hung over the worst-hit parts of the city. The US Embassy in Port Moresby said shots were fired near its compound as police tried to  “disperse groups of looters”.
A smaller crowd gathered earlier outside the prime minister’s office in Port Moresby, tearing a security gate off its rails and torching a parked police car. Beijing has lodged a complaint with Papua New Guinea’s government, following reports that rioters targeted Chinese-owned businesses.
Its foreign ministry said two Chinese nationals had been  “lightly injured” in the violence. “We remind Chinese nationals in PNG to pay close attention to the changing security situation on the ground,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday.
Port Moresby resident Maho Laveil, an economics lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea, said peace had  “largely been restored” by Thursday evening. “They’ve chased the looters away, they’ve stopped the buildings from burning,” he said. National Capital District governor Powes Parkop said the unrest represented an  “unprecedented level of strife” in Port Moresby, while local newspaper the Post Courier called it the city’s  “darkest day”.
“What is most important is that we must end this strife,” Parkop told a local radio station Wednesday evening. “Nobody will be a winner in this type of civil unrest.” Security forces staged a protest inside Papua New Guinea’s parliament after noticing their pay had been docked.
Although the government swiftly promised to fix what it described as a payroll  “glitch”, it was not enough to stop disgruntled civilians from joining the fray. The prime minister said four department chiefs involved in the payroll problem — the heads of personnel, finance and treasury as well as Police Commissioner David Manning — had all been suspended for 14 days. The burst of violence highlights the often volatile nature of life in Papua New Guinea, a country plagued by poverty and high levels of crime.
Less than 200 kilometres from Australia’s northernmost border, Papua New Guinea is the largest and most populous state in Melanesia. Although it is blessed with vast deposits of gas, gold and minerals, human rights groups estimate that almost 40 percent of its nine million citizens still live below the poverty line.

1,Al Shabaab captures UN helicopter in Somalia,MOGADISHU: Soma­lia’s military said on Thursday it was searching for a number of people  “taken hostage” by...,"MOGADISHU: Soma­lia’s military said on Thursday it was searching for a number of people  “taken hostage” by the militant group Al Shabaab after a UN helicopter made an emergency landing in hostile territory.
The United Nations has confirmed one of its choppers was involved in an  “aviation incident” in central Galmudug state on Wednesday but said nothing about the fate of the passengers and crew.
Somali military officials said the search was focussing on Hindhere, an area 470 km north of Mogadishu where the chopper is believed to have landed following a technical fault. Somali National Army Captain Abdusalam Mohamed said the exact location of the helicopter was not known.
“But we have confirmed that Al Shabaab has taken hostage several of the personnel aboard the aircraft. We believe they are being held in the Hindhere area,” he said from a military base in Galmudug.
“There are already efforts underway to establish their whereabouts, and search operations are ongoing in the area where the aircraft vanished.” Mohamed Adan, another military commander in Galmudug, said  “some of the passengers captured by Al Shabaab are foreigners” but could not provide further details.
An internal UN memo circulated to staff in Somalia said nine people were aboard the helicopter when it  “crash landed” and six were reportedly taken into captivity.
One passenger was believed to have been killed and two had fled, the memo added.
“We have been briefed about the incident and it was confirmed that there is a hostage situation including foreigners but no details are available so far,” a UN staff member in Mogadishu said.
Helicopters were seen flying low over the Galmudug town of Wisil on Thursday, Osman Warsame, a traditional elder in the area, said. “We have been told they are looking for the missing helicopter and its passengers,” he said, adding that the area was underAl Shabaab control.

2,Pentagon begins probe into Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin’s hospitalisation,Austin has been hospitalised since Jan 1 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre — a fact the Pen­tagon had kept from the public.,"WASHINGTON: The US Defence Department’s inspector general office said on Thursday it had opened a review into the handling of Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin’s hospitalisation.
It will be the first independent, non-partisan probe into Austin’s secret prostate cancer diagnosis, his surgery and hospitalisation. Both the Pentagon and Republican lawmakers have announced their own reviews.
Austin, who is 70, has been hospitalised since Jan 1 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre — a fact the Pen­tagon had kept from the public, the White House and Congress for much of last week, triggering a major political backlash.
President Joe Biden’s administration has struggled to calm the political furor over revelations the president did not know of his defence secretary’s Jan 1 hospitalisation until Jan 4.
An inspector general’s office statement said: “The objective of the review is to examine the roles, processes, procedures, responsibilities, and actions related to the Secretary of Defence’s hospitalisation.”
It said the review would “assess whether the DoD’s policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications and the effective transition of authorities.”
Austin sits just below Biden at the top of the US military’s chain of command. His duties require him to be available at a moment’s notice to respond to any national security crisis.
That includes always being ready to enter secure communications with other officials in the event of an incoming nuclear attack, something that could be difficult from an intensive care unit.

3,Blast kills two in Kabul’s Hazara enclave,Police spokesperson says grenade was detonated outside a commercial centre.,"KABUL: Two people were killed and 12 wounded in an explosion in western Kabul on Thursday, police said, in the third deadly blast to hit the Afghan capital in less than a week.
Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran said a grenade was detonated outside a commercial centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area, an enclave of the historically oppressed Hazara community.
“The initial information shows that unfortunately two civilian compatriots were martyred and 12 others were wounded,” Zadran said in a statement. By early evening the road in front of the centre was open but dozens of security personnel were still there and had blocked access to the site of the blast, journalists saw.
Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said it was treating 13 patients wounded in the explosion, including two children and a teenaged boy. The blast is the second deadly explosion in the area in less than a week.
On Saturday, a bomb planted on a bus that killed at least five people and wounded another 15 was claimed by the militant Islamic State group. IS claimed responsibility for another blast days later in eastern Kabul, in which police said three people were killed and four wounded by a bomb hidden in a cart near a minivan.In November, at least seven people were killed in an explosion on a bus in Dasht-e-Barchi that was claimed by IS. In late October, the group also claimed a deadly explosion in a sports club in the same neighbourhood.

4,Saudi Arabia launches residency plans to draw foreign talent,Says initiative aims to further drive country’s economic transformation by creating employment opportunities.,"DUBAI: Saudi Arabia on Thursday launched new residency programmes aimed at attracting skilled professionals and investment as the Gulf country forges ahead with its plan to pivot its economy away from fossil fuels.
“The initiative aims to further drive the country’s economic transformation by creating employment opportunities and fostering knowledge transfers,” it said in a statement.
The five new premium programmes cater specifically to professionals in healthcare, sports and real estate, amongst others. They will offer holders opportunities to settle in Saudi Arabia, conduct business, own real estate and obtain work permits for holders and family members.
The move is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 economic transformation plan to wean Saudi Arabia’s economy off its dependence on oil, which includes attracting billions in foreign direct investment.

5,"China, Maldives upgrade ties with infrastructure deals","Beijing to support Male in health, energy, agriculture and marine sectors.","BEIJING: China pledged on Thursday to extend funding for infrastructure in the Maldives, after it upgraded ties with the strategic Indian Ocean archipelago.
With Beijing and New Delhi tussling for influence, Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu was elected in September after pledging to cultivate “strong ties” with China and eject Indian troops.
Muizzu embarked this week on his first state visit to China — the Maldives’ largest external creditor — and on Thursday, the two sides issued a joint communique detailing the “broad consensus” reached by their two leaders.
China vowed to “continue to provide support within its capacity to the Maldives side in areas of priority concern”, the statement published on state broadcaster CCTV said.
That included “infrastructure construction, medical care and health care, improvement of people’s livelihoods, new energy sources, agriculture and marine environmental protection”, it said.

Beijing to support Male in health, energy, agriculture and marine sectors

Muizzu, in turn, thanked China for its “selfless assistance” in providing the Maldives with development funds.
The communique followed a meeting on Wednesday with President Xi Jinping at which Beijing announced the “elevation of bilateral ties”.
“Under the new circumstances, China-Maldives relations face a historic opportunity to build on past achievements and forge ahead,” Xi told Muizzu, according to China’s state news agency Xinhua.
Xi “stressed that China respects and supports the Maldives in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions”, it said.
Beijing “supports the Maldives firmly in safeguarding its national sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national dignity”, he said.
Muizzu thanked Xi for “China’s significant role in the Maldives’ economic success” and Beijing’s role in the “infrastructure development of the Maldives”, according to a readout from his office.
Deals signed
Muizzu’s party was an eager recipient of funds from the Belt and Road infrastructure programme, a central pillar of Xi’s bid to expand China’s influence overseas.
His mentor, former president Abdulla Yameen, borrowed heavily from Beijing for construction projects and spurned India.
That left it owing 42 per cent of its total external debts of more than $3 billion to Beijing in 2021, according to the World Bank, citing the Maldives’ finance ministry.
Eleven per cent of that debt was owed to China’s Exim Bank, a key Belt and Road creditor.
The Maldives signed several fresh agreements with China on Wednesday, including ones on climate, agriculture and infrastructure, Muizzu’s office said.
No details about the value of the agreements were shared by either side.
The Maldives, primarily known as one of the most expensive holiday destinations in South Asia, with pristine white beaches and secluded resorts, has also become a geopolitical hotspot.

6,Scientists link dinosaur fossil to new Tyrannosaurus species,Say subtle differences from Tyrannosaurus rex observed in the skull merit recognising the dinosaur as a separate species.,"WASHINGTON: Scientists reassessing a partial skull first unearthed in 1983 in southeastern New Mexico have concluded that the fossil represents a new species of Tyrannosaurus — the fearsome apex predator from western North America at the twilight of the dinosaur age — that predated the fabulously famous T. rex.
Subtle differences from Tyrannosaurus rex observed in the skull merit recognising the dinosaur as a separate species called Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis that lived several million years before T. rex and was comparable in size, the researchers said on Thursday. The skull previously was identified as a T. rex.
Other researchers expressed doubt that it represents a new Tyrannosaurus species, saying differences between it and other T. rex skulls were unremarkable and the study’s conclusion that the fossil dated to 71-73 million years ago was problematic.
T. rex has been the sole species of the genus Tyrannosaurus recognised since the dinosaur was first described in 1905. A genus is a broader grouping of related organisms than a species. T. rex fossils date to the couple million years before an asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago, dooming the dinosaurs.
The first parts of the New Mexico skull were found near the base of Kettle Top Butte in 1983, with more later discovered. Paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo, executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science and one of the authors of the study published in the journal Scientific Reports, said about 25pc of the skull has been collected. Most of the braincase and the upper jaws are missing.

7,Desmond Tutu statue with Palestinian scarf to go up in South Africa today,"The late Nobel peace laureate’s “life-size statue” will be temporarily on show “until the bombing of Gaza stops”, his foundation says.","JOHANNESBURG: A statue of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu wearing a Palestinian scarf will be put up in Cape Town on Friday to symbolise his decades-long work championing justice for Palestinians, his foundation said.
The late Nobel peace laureate’s “life-size statue” will be temporarily on show “until the bombing of Gaza stops”, the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said on Thursday.
“He was an outspoken critic of the state of Israel’s policies and treatment of Palestine and Palestinians, which he likened to the policies and actions of apartheid South Africa,” the foundation said. The announcement came as lawyers for Pretoria presented their case at the UN’s top court in The Hague after the country lodged an urgent appeal to force Israel to  “immediately suspend” military operations in Gaza.
South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause.
The country has cut off diplomatic ties with Israel over its response to the Hamas raids on Oct 7.
Tutu’s statue will be on display on the balcony of his foundation’s headquarters.
The 200-year-old site in central Cape Town, known as Old Granary Building, was rescued by Tutu after falling in disrepair, having previously housed a court and post office.
Tutu visited both Israel and Gaza “on a number of occasions, including as an emissary of the United Nations”, his foundation said in a joint statement with the Archbishop Desmond Tutu Intellectual Property Trust.
The peace icon “fervently believed that the greatest beneficiaries of a just dispensation for Palestine, besides Palestinians themselves, would be the citizens of  Israel”, they added.
The Anglican archbishop emeritus, who died in 2021 aged 90, was regarded as a moral beacon in South Africa and was involved in numerous diplomatic peace efforts around the globe.

8,Indian state stops funding to Muslim religious schools,Thousands of teachers are set to lose their jobs,"NEW DELHI: India’s most populous state has stopped paying some 21,000 teachers of subjects including mathematics and science in Muslim religious schools, or madrasas, an official said on Thursday, and they could lose their jobs altogether.  
The teachers work at madrasas in Uttar Pradesh, ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party, and the move comes ahead of Modi seeking his third straight term in a general election due by May.  
“Over 21,000 teachers are set to lose their jobs,” Iftikhar Ahmed Javed, chief of Uttar Pradesh’s madrasa education board, said. “Muslim students and teachers will go back by 30 years.”  
Muslims are a minority in mainly Hindu India, accounting for about 14 per cent of a population of 1.42 billion, and they make up nearly a fifth of the population of Uttar Pradesh.  
Rights groups such as Human Rights Watch say nationalist groups have threatened and harassed Muslim and other religious minorities with impunity under Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusations the party denies.  

Thousands of teachers are set to lose their jobs 

According to a document seen by Reuters, the federal government stopped funding the programme, called the Scheme For Providing Quality Education in Madrasas, in March 2022.  
The document, from the Ministry of Minority Affairs, shows the Modi government did not approve any new proposals from states under the programme between the 2017-18 and 2020-21 fiscal years, before closing it altogether.  
The government raised funding for the programme to a record of about three billion rupees ($36 million) in the fiscal year to March 2016. His office did not respond to a request for comment.  
India’s minority affairs ministry, which ran the programme until it was closed, also did not respond to requests to comment.  
The document did not cite a reason but a government official said it could be because a 2009 law ensuring free compulsory education for children covers regular government schools.  
Government data shows more than 70,000 madrasas were covered in the first six years of the programme, started in 2009-10 by the previous government run by the Congress party.  
The programme benefited Muslim children and should be revived, said Shahid Akhter, a member of a government panel on minority educational institutions.
