JUSTICE Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Mazahar Naqvi

• Observers say SJC-hit colleague’s resignation put Justice Ahsan in awkward position
• Abrupt exit to benefit Justice Mansoor, who moves up in seniority list; also replaces outgoing judge on SJC, special committee on formation of benches
ISLAMABAD: Justice Ijazul Ahsan, the third senior-most judge in the Supreme Court who was destined to become the next chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) in Oct this year, opted to leave office just a day after his colleague stepped down following allegations of misconduct.
A day earlier, Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi had tendered his resignation amid proceedings against him in the Supreme Judicial Council, which is led by CJP Qazi Faez Isa.
The abrupt resignation of Justice Ahsan will benefit the next senior judge, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, since he will become the next chief justice soon after the retirement of CJP Isa on Oct 25, 2024. Otherwise, Justice Shah was expected to hold the coveted office from Aug 3, 2025.
Justice Shah now also replaces Justice Ahsan on the Supreme Judicial Council, as well as the three-member special committee in charge of bench formation.
A senior counsel, on condition of anonymity, hoped that the elevation of Justice Shah as the next CJP would hopefully bring stability to the institution. “It’s time that the wounds are healed for the future.”
 
 

After the resignation of Justice Ahsan, the strength of the Supreme Court has been reduced to 14 out of the available 16 judges, against a sancti­oned strength of 17.
‘Surprise resignation letter’
“I no longer wish to continue as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, I, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, resign as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in terms of Article 206(1) of the Constitution with immediate effect,” said the one-page resignation letter sent to President Dr Arif Alvi.
“I have had the honour and privilege of serving as a judge of the Lahore High Court, the chief justice of the Lahore High Court and a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” said the resignation duly signed by Justice Ahsan.
 
 

Justice Ahsan was also allegedly embroiled in a controversy of hearing a case of his former client, M/s BNP (Private) Limited relating to the One Constitution building and extending relief to them.
“A purge of judges is taking place at the Supreme Court,” senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui was quick to respond to the resignation.
“This is, in essence, PCO (Provisional Constitution Order) by other means,” he claimed. According to the counsel, the ultimate objective was to silence dissenting judicial voices. “Have no doubt, no judge is safe now,” he regretted.
Former additional attorney general (AAG) Tariq Mehmood Khokhar regretted that Justice Ijazul Ahsan resigned under a shadow.
“It is a shadow of a national witchhunt (perceived or otherwise) against out-of-step judges, politicians, and journalists amid constitutional, democratic, and judicial ambivalence. It bodes ill for an already-fractured institution,” he said.
“It is very surprising to hear that Justice Ahsan has resigned,” former minister Ishaq Khakwani said, adding he found him to be a “very honourable judge”.
“A person of few words and carried himself with dignity,” he said, hoping that the institution would recover soon from these events.
Road to resignation
Though the resignation letter did not divulge many details, legal experts believed that the surprise departure of Justice Naqvi, who Justice Ahsan had gone the extra mile to defend before the SJC, had left him red-faced.
 
 

Recently, Justice Ahsan had written a long note to the SJC where he said that the SJC proceedings against Justice Naqvi were being conducted in haste contrary to the established norms.
This note was also mentioned by CJP Isa during SJC proceedings on Thursday, who said that one of the members — an obvious reference to Justice Ahsan — had written a long note disagreeing with what was happening in the council.
“The judge wrote that the proceedings were being conducted in haste and contrary to the established norms, but nobody informed us what established norm the council should have followed,” the CJP quipped.
When the SJC commenced its proceedings on Thursday, it comprised four members. Later, the council began its proceedings with Justice Shah replacing Justice Ahsan. The council stated that if a judge “resigns before the initiation of council proceedings, it was a different ball game than the judge who resigned after the issuance of the show-cause notice”.
Differences between CJP and Ahsan
After Justice Isa became the CJP, differences started to surface between the him and Justice Ahsan, with the latter being dubbed by his detractors as a part of the so-called ‘Bandial group’.
On Dec 12, 2023, CJP Isa, in response to the objections raised by Justice Ahsan to the working of the three-judge committee that fixes cases before different benches, had emphasised that the primary and first responsibility of a judge was to attend judicial work.
In his response, Justice Isa also questioned the work ethic of Justice Ahsan, saying: “We are paid to work six days, not four and a half days”.
After the full court proceedings to decide challenges to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, Justice Ahsan was never seen sitting on any bench headed by the chief justice.
The last significant judgement by Justice Ahsan pertained to the military courts, in which a five-member bench in a unanimous verdict declared the trial of 103 civilians allegedly involved in the May 9 violence against the Constitution.
Justice Ahsan had also taken up the issue with two special benches formed by the special committee, of which he was a part, to hear intra-court appeals (ICA) in the military court case and the Justice Naqvi case.
PML-N demands accountability
PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb demanded that Justice Ahsan must be held accountable. In a press conference, she said the resignation could not exonerate him from the “terrible actions” against the democracy and constitution.
 






“You were the monitoring judge [in Panama Papers case]; you called a democratic political party a ‘Sicilian Mafia’; you were the one who put together ‘gems’ of your choice in the JIT; made a mockery of justice…” the PML-N leader alleged.
In a comment on the resignation of the two judges, she claimed the top court would be strengthened with the exit of such judges.

1,Justice Naqvi still in Supreme Judicial Council dock despite resignation,"Council also decides to hear Justice Naqvi, saying he may do so today if he wants.","ISLAMABAD: Even after the resignation of Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi from the Supreme Court, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Thursday decided to continue with its proceedings against the former judge, facing allegations of misconduct.
The SJC also decided to hear Justice Naqvi, saying if the judge wanted to address the council directly or through his counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, then he may do so on Friday (today).
But in case the former judge sought time, then SJC will proceed by recording the testimony of witnesses who were also in attendance and whom the council had summoned, the order dictated by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa said. Justice Isa said it was necessary to remove the misperception that the institution of the judiciary was above the law.
 
 

During the proceedings, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan explained that Article 209(5)(6) stipulated that once the SJC “takes cognisance of the matter, it has to give its findings”. These provisions did not envisage tendering of resignation by a judge.
In the present case, the SJC, which was seized with 10 complaints against the judge, had convened repeatedly and issued a show-cause notice (SCN). Even the respondent judge had sought time and later filed a comprehensive reply denying the allegations.
Even if the judge tendered his resignation under pressure, it did not mean that he had accepted the allegations, which could be false, the AGP contended. On the other hand, even if the judge was found guilty of misconduct, the citizens were entitled to know about the real facts, especially when notices had already been issued to the witnesses — a number of them were in attendance also in Courtroom No. 1.
“If left unattended and if allegations are found altogether false, then not only the reputation of the apex court but of the entire judiciary will unnecessarily be sullied,” the CJP observed. Justice Isa said that the strength of the institution was in self-regulation and correcting its course.
During the proceedings, it was said that in case allegations proved baseless, then there would be action against complainants. The complainants responded that they were ready to face the consequences of their actions.
The AGP also drew the attention of the SJC towards the 2023 Afiya Shehrbano Zia case, saying though the facts of the case did not mention anything, he found out the case pertained to former chief justice Saqib Nisar.
“The case was not attended to until the retirement of Saqib Nisar,” the AGP said, adding the petition was filed in 2020 and decided on June 27, 2023. At the time, the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 had been enacted but the division bench of the apex court decided the matter while overlooking this fact.
The law, which was enacted on April 21, 2023, requires that any petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution will be decided by a bench not less than three judges. The division bench should have waited for the outcome of the full court of 15 judges which had taken up the vires of the act.
Moreover, the division bench also dismissed the matter in limine without issuing any notice to the AGP for getting any proper assistance. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah also observed that the mere resignation of a judge will not abate the proceedings before the council.
The individual judge may have tendered his resignation under pressure but the council should continue with the job to decide one way or the other since public institutions should always be responsible, the CJP observed.

2,"Secret proceedings of cipher trial scrapped, again",Adiala Jail chief directed to explain why reporters are denied access to Imran’s in-camera trial.,"• AGP assures court testimonies taken after Dec 14 will be recorded afresh
• Adiala Jail chief directed to explain why reporters are denied access to Imran’s in-camera trial
ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Thursday again scrapped the cipher trial proceedings by setting aside the special court’s Dec 14 order sanctioning in-camera hearings.
IHC Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb also declared the testimonies of nine witnesses recorded before the special court illegal.
The IHC was addressing an appeal challenging Special Court Judge Abual Hasnat Mohammad Zulqarnain’s Dec 14 decision, which had sanctioned a closed-door trial for former prime minister Imran Khan at the prosecution’s request.
 
 

This directive also involved orders to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority to prevent any reporting on the court’s proceedings.
Judge Hasnat had justified the in-camera proceedings under Section 14 of the Official Secrets Act, citing the need to “protect the sanctity of the cipher” — a confidential communication between Pakistan’s foreign missions and the Foreign Office — and the “sanctity of the state”.
Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan acknowledged that since Dec 14, a total of 13 witnesses had given statements, with three undergoing cross-examination. He told the court that these witnesses’ state­ments would be recorded afresh.
Mr Awan admitted that the trial proceedings from Dec 14 to 21 were not open to the public. He also conceded that the Dec 14 order was legally unsustainable, stating no objection to its nullification and confirming that the prosecution did not intend to request in-camera proceedings in the future.
Justice Aurangzeb observed that since the Dec 14 order for declaring the in-camera proceeding had not been recalled by the trial court, the court could not validate the statements recorded behind closed doors.
Subsequently, the court set aside the special court’s order and declared the subsequent proceedings as illegal.
Plea seeking media access
Meanwhile, IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq sought a response from the superintendent of Adiala Jail and the Attorney General Office on a petition seeking access for the court reporters to witness the jail trial of former prime minister Imran Khan.
 
 

The petition, filed by a court reporter, said the jail authorities denied him access to witness the court proceeding even though the IHC has repeatedly observed that the jail proceeding was not in-camera.
The reporter’s counsel, Barrister Umer Ijaz Gillani, told the court that denying access to witness the cases related to a former prime minister was contradictory to Article 19 of the Constitution and Section 352 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
He said jail authorities were whimsically applying the discretion, depriving millions of people of their right to know the truth.
Justice Farooq issued notices to the respondent authorities and set the next hearing for Jan 15.

3,IMF board nod allows disbursement of $700m,"""Outlook remains challenging and dependent on the implementation of sound policies”, the IMF board observes.","WASHINGTON: In a significant development, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on Thursday that it had successfully concluded the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme, backed by the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), paving the way for an immediate disbursement of SDR 528 million, equivalent to approximately $700m.
This latest disbursement brings the cumulative total under the arrangement to an impressive SDR 1.422 billion, roughly $1.9bn. The financial support provided by the IMF underscores the global confidence in Pakistan’s commitment to implementing essential economic reforms.
 






The successful review signifies a crucial step forward for Pakistan as it continues to navigate economic challenges and work towards fostering stability. The disbursement is expected to provide the much-needed support to the country’s financial framework, facilitating the implementation of key reforms outlined in the IMF-supported programme.
 
 

The board’s decision reflects a recognition of Pakistan’s efforts in add­re­ssing economic vulnerabilities and implementing policy measures aimed at promoting sustainable growth.
“Economic activity has stabilised in Pakistan, although the outlook remains challenging and dependent on the implementation of sound policies,” the IMF board observed.
It also said that “continued timely and consistent implementation of programme policies remains critical, with no room for slippage”.
The board reminded Pakistan that it “requires strict adherence to fiscal targets while protecting social spending, a market-determined exchange rate to absorb external shocks, and further progress on structural reforms to support stronger and more inclusive growth”.
The IMF board noted that macroeconomic conditions in Pakistan have generally improved, with the growth of 2pc expected in FY24 as the nascent recovery expands in the second half of the year. The fiscal position also strengthened in FY24Q1 achieving a primary surplus of 0.4pc of GDP driven by overall strong revenues.
 
 

Inflation remains elevated, altho­ugh with appropriately tight policy, this could decline to 18.5pc by the end of June 2024. Gross reserves incre­ased to $8.2bn in December 2023, up from $4.5bn in June, while the exch­ange rate has been broadly stable.
The current account deficit is expected to rise to around 1.5pc of GDP in FY24 as the recovery takes hold. Assuming sustained sound macroeconomic policy and structural reform implementation, inflation should return to the State Bank of Pakistan’s target and growth continue to strengthen over the medium term.
The IMF stressed that boosting jobs and inclusive growth in Pakistan requires continuing protection of the vulnerable through Benazir Income Support Progra­mme and accelerating structural reforms.
It also emphasised the need for improving the business environment and levelling the playing field for investors, advancing the SOE reform agenda and safeguards related to the Sovereign Wealth Fund.

4,"Amid contempt threat, ECP-PTI ‘bat-tle’ lands in apex court","SC to hear electoral watchdog’s plea in poll symbol case today; party moves PHC for contempt proceedings against CEC, others.","• Top court to hear electoral watchdog’s plea in poll symbol case today
• Party moves PHC for contempt proceedings against chief election commissioner, others
ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR: All eyes are on the Supreme Court as a three judge-bench is set to deliberate on a critical appeal by the Election Commission today, challenging the Peshawar High Court’s decision to restore the PTI’s election symbol.
Simultaneously, the PTI has initiated legal action in the Peshawar High Court, filing a contempt petition against Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and other ECP members for not implementing the high court’s order in the PTI’s intra-party elections case.
 
 

The Supreme Court hearing, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising justices Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Musarrat Hilali, holds significant implications for the country’s electoral landscape, particularly as returning officers are scheduled to allocate symbols to candidates tomorrow.
The ECP’s petition, submitted by former attorney general Makhdoom Ali Khan, argued that the Peshawar High Court should not have proceeded with the case without first issuing a notice to the Attorney General for Pakistan.
This procedural step was necessary because the legal question at hand pertained to the federal government, involving the interpretation of Article 17 of the Constitution and its relationship with the provisions of the Elections Act of 2017, it said.
The petition also highlighted that the PHC’s order conflicted with previous Supreme Court rulings, which have consistently discouraged high courts from intervening in the electoral process, which, as per the Constitution, is exclusively within the ECP’s jurisdiction.
 
 

The petition emphasised that the high court’s judgement effectively nullified key sections of the Elections Act and Election Rules by restricting the ECP’s constitutional and statutory roles in regulating and supervising intra-party elections of political parties. This interpretation contradicted the principles established in previous superior court rulings, it said.
Furthermore, it undermined the fundamental purpose of Section 215(5) of the Act, in conjunction with Rules 157 and 158, which aim to foster democracy, pluralism, and transparency within political parties by ensuring timely intra-party elections, it added.
Additionally, the PHC ruling disregarded the essence of Section 208(2) of the Elections Act, which is intended to guarantee equal opportunities for all party members to contest elections for any political party office.
It said the high court order not only rendered relevant provisions practically redundant but also enabled a political party to undertake “sham” intra-party elections without any checks and balances. This, the ECP’s petition said, was not only contrary to Article 17 of the Constitution but was also in conflict with the principles of democracy.
The petition also pointed out that the PHC’s order overlooked the fact that the Elections Act was enacted under a democratic government and led to the repeal of various election laws, some of which were established during times of extra-constitutional rule.
Contempt plea against ECP
Meanwhile, the PTI petitioned the Peshawar High Court on Thursday, seeking to initiate contempt proceedings against the chief election commissioner and other ECP members for not implementing the court’s order.
A contempt petition was filed on behalf of the party by senior lawyers Qazi Muhammad Anwar and Shah Faisal Ilyas, requesting the court to punish the respondents in accordance with the law for not complying with the directions and orders passed by the court on Jan 10 (Wednesday).
A two-member bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Wiqar Ahmad will take up the petition for hearing today (Friday).
 
 

Setting aside the ECP’s order of Dec 22 of nullifying the PTI’s intra-party polls and revoking its electoral symbol, the PHC had ordered the ECP to publish the certificate of PTI’s intra-party polls on its website.
The court also declared the PTI entitled to get the election symbol strictly in terms of Sections 215 and 217 of the Elections Act of 2017.
In its contempt plea, the PTI has argued that the respondents are fully aware of the PHC’s order and still have not issued a certificate of the PTI on its website, which amounted to contempt of the court.
“Despite clear-cut directions, the respondents are avoiding its compliance just to make hurdles in the way of PTI for the upcoming general elections,” the petition said.
The respondents “disregarded the order of this honourable court and downgraded the authority of this honourable court,” the petition said. “That omission of respondents to act upon the order of this honourable court speaks of the fact that respondents undermined the authority of this honourable court.”
The plea accused the respondents of not “moving an inch” for implementing the PHC order and “wilfully disobeying the same”.
