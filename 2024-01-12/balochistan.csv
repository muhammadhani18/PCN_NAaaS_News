CT scan outsourcing
Punjab Health Secretary Ali Jan Khan signed an agreement for outsourcing the CT scan services in tertiary care government hospitals.
He said on the occasion that a firm would provide CT scan facilities to patients in government teaching hospitals round the clock under the agreement.
The firm will also be responsible for the maintenance of CT scan machines in the hospitals.
In response to the surge in pneumonia cases in Punjab, the caretaker provincial government has declared a 7-day hiatus for nursery and playgroup classes up to class one. Additionally, morning assemblies have been prohibited in schools across Punjab until January 31.
The prevalence of viral pneumonia is on the rise, particularly among children, attributed to the increasing cold weather.
It is noteworthy that the 22-day winter break in Punjab, including Lahore, has concluded, and educational activities have resumed in all public and private schools from today.
Health experts have warned that the continued presence of thick smog across Punjab has become a real threat to citizens’ health as the air pollution rate is increasing at an alarming rate and thereby, also causing various diseases such as chest infection and pneumonia.
The doctor advised that pneumonia is undoubtedly a risky respiratory health infection which can become a big problem when air pollution levels increase. Citizens should stay indoors during foggy weather as the risk of pneumonia and other severe respiratory problems is doubled during this period, which also increases the risk of mortality.
The expert also suggested plenty of rest, warm beverages, steam baths or the use of humidifiers in houses to ensure moisture in the air and timely consultations with doctors.
Pneumonia symptoms start off as fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Not only are adults susceptible to pneumonia, but children and the elderly can also be affected.
A spokesman for the Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department said they did not released any data of deaths due to Pneumonia and following government institutions from today (Friday) they will start collecting data in connection with Pneumonia.

1,Acid attack suspects injured in encounter,Female schoolteacher was attacked with acid three days ago,"Two suspects allegedly involved in the acid attack on a female schoolteacher just three days ago were shot and injured during an encounter with the police in Shahdara Town on Thursday.
The incident unfolded when the police, operating a checkpoint near Kala Khatai T Point on GT Road, spotted two suspicious motorcyclists.
Upon signalling them to stop for inspection, the suspects reportedly opened fire, prompting the police to respond in self-defence.
The exchange of gunfire resulted in both suspects sustaining bullet injuries.
The injured individuals have been identified as Yasir and Naveed, the same suspects accused of hurling acid at a schoolteacher a few days earlier.

City SP Qazi Ali stated that the wounded suspects were promptly taken to the hospital for medical treatment.
He added that further investigations into the matter were underway and revealed that the police had recovered the weapon used by the suspects to open fire on the police party.
Two days before the encounter, suspect Umar Farooq was apprehended at Sialkot International Airport while attempting to flee to Dubai. Another suspect, Ghulam Mustafa, allegedly involved in the case, was arrested on Tuesday.
The victim, accompanied by her brother, suffered serious burn injuries and was admitted to a nearby hospital for treatment.

2,Youth held for staging ‘kidnapping’,Friends’ ploy to extort ransom from families exposed,"A college student has been arrested along with four accomplices on the charge of staging his own kidnapping to receive Rs2 million in ransom from his family after suffering loss in online business.
The family of Abdullah, a second-year student of a private college and resident of Colony No.1 had informed the Khanewal city police that unidentified people had kidnapped him and demanded Rs 2 million ransom.
The police registered a case and started investigation.

When the police went to record his statement after two days, his family refused to allow it, saying he was too terrified to speak about the matter. When the SHO questioned him later, he kept giving contradictory statements contrary to the phone call data record (CDR) while sobbing.
According to a police official, he claimed that a girlfriend of his from Lahore had kidnapped him in a car and recorded hid nude videos. When the police viewed the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the spot mentioned by the youth, his story about the kidnapping proved false. 
The boy then confessed that he had staged the kidnapping with his four friends and kept asking for money from his family through phone chat. 
He conceded that he had stayed in a hotel in Multan with his friends Sameer, Adan, Shahzeb and Abdul Rehman.

3,Call for raising marriage age limit for girls,Force marriage of minor girls could lead to multiple health problems,"Punjab Minister for Primary and Secondary Healthcare Dr Jamal Nasir emphasised the need for raising the upper age limit for the marriage of girls, because hormonal changes during adolescence often lead to physiological issues.
The minister was speaking at a consultative session arranged under the auspices of the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) on Thursday.
Dr Nasir maintained that forcing the marriage of minor girls, or those who were not physically or emotionally mature, could lead to multiple health problems in these young brides.

“Furthermore, medical evidence supports the fact that females are genetically and naturally more vulnerable, necessitating the protection of their fundamental rights,” the minister remarked.
“Subjecting them to married life at such a young age can cause a drastic deterioration in their physical health,” he added. 
Our society grapples with a dilemma when dealing with infertility; typically, the burden of costly and painful testing falls solely on the wife, while the husband may neglect such examinations. This societal behaviour contributes to both physical and mental health issues,” Dr Nasir said.

4,Canal cleaning delay puts Rahim Yar Khan’s agriculture at risk,"Despite official pledge, annual canal cleaning schedule still pending","The irrigation department in Rahim Yar Khan has yet to issue a schedule for the annual and six-month cleaning of canals, despite a clear directive from Chief Minister Punjab Mohsin Naqvi seven days ago.
The prolonged negligence in canal maintenance has now endangered the world's largest canal system along the soil banks in the district.
The accumulation of silt in the canals and the weakening of riverbanks pose severe threats.
In the past year, Rahim Yar Khan witnessed 23 canal-breaking incidents, leading to widespread destruction of crops across thousands of acres.
Illegal canals on Abbasia Link Canal, Dallas Branch, Panjnad Canal, Aab-e-Hayat, Adam Sahaba, Saadiq Canal, and Headworks along the Chenab River persist, signalling a failure in eliminating unauthorised water channels.
The delayed canal cleaning, coupled with alleged embezzlement of funds earmarked for periodic maintenance, has left the canal system along the Head Panjnad—from Head Panjnad to Rahim Yar Khan—vulnerable to potential disasters.
Approximately 251 small and large canals, crucial for transporting water from the Head Panjnad to Rahim Yar Khan, face imminent danger due to eroding soil along their banks.
Major canals, including Abbasia Link Canal, Dallas Branch, Panjnad Canal, Aab-e-Hayat, Adam Sahaba, Saadiq Canal, and various Headworks, have suffered extensive damage due to soil erosion and lack of maintenance.

Recent years have seen weakened canal banks due to heavy rains and illegal activities by the timber mafia. The recurring incidents of canal breaks have led to substantial losses for farmers in terms of damaged crops.
Farmers' Protection Movement Chairman Chaudhry Muhammad Yaseen has urgently called on the government to initiate immediate canal cleaning in Rahim Yar Khan and surrounding areas to avert severe agricultural losses.
All Pakistan Kisan Foundation Chairman Syed Mahmoodul Haq Bukhari criticised the irrigation department's temporary approach to canal cleaning, alleging that funds are misused every year.
The Head Panjnad, responsible for supplying water from Head Panjnad to Rahim Yar Khan, reportedly faces the theft of 2,200 cusecs of water through illegal means, severely impacting thousands of farmers in Tehsil Rahim Yar Khan and Sadikabad.
While Chief Minister Naqvi's recent commitment to comprehensive canal cleaning for improved water supply to crops is acknowledged, the lack of visible action from the Irrigation Department in Rahim Yar Khan demands urgent attention.
Addressing issues of illegal canals and water theft from the Head Panjnad is crucial to preventing further losses for farmers in the region.
