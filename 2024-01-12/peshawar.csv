3,Militants deserve no sympathy: PM,Says state will fight against all those supporting militant ideology.,"PESHAWAR: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Thursday said militants had decided to fight against the state and therefore, the state had no choice but to fight that war with wisdom and courage.
“This is their [militants’] own choice to become suicide bombers and assassins, so they don’t deserve sympathy,” Kakar said during a police darbar at the Governor’s House here.
The prime minister said the nation never forgot the 2014 massacre of children at Peshawar’s Army Public School, so militants had lost the “sympathy they used to enjoy 20 years ago.”
Mr Kakar said the state would fight against all those people, who subscribed to militant ideology.
He said the militants thought they’re doing a great job but they would run away from each other on the Day of Judgement.

Says state will fight against all those supporting militant ideology

The prime minister questioned if the war against militancy had concluded with the martyrdom of Frontier Constabulary commandant Safwat Ghayur in a suicide attack in 2010.
He said everyone remembered Ghayur but nobody remembered even a single of over 2,000 militants killed by security forces in the country.
Mr Kakar said the state had empowered the police under the law to act against anyone involved in armed struggle and that the state and the society stood by the police.
He said anyone, who had any objection to or disagreed with the law of the land — a global law rather — should go to some other place.
The prime minister said militants carried out “behind the back attacks and couldn’t fight face to face.”
He wondered if the state should surrender to militants.
“Let it be known to everybody that the state will respond one thousand times to their [militants’] 10 attacks,” he said.
Mr Kakar said sometimes, people warned him that he had just 20 days left in office, but he would keep speaking against militancy until his last breath and that, too, with more intensity and passion.
He said the state’s fight against militancy should be fought with wisdom and courage.
“You have won this war and what is left is its announcement. I don’t know [when this victory will be announced] but it will take some time to happen,” he told police officers and personnel.
The prime minister said the state was going to win the war against militancy for being on the right path.
“The Almighty Allah helps those who are on the right path,” he said.
Mr Kakar said the state would take the fight against militancy to its logical end.
He also announced the government would look into the demands and issues of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s police.
Earlier, provincial inspector general of police Akhtar Hayat Gandapur welcomed the prime minister to the event.
He said the provinces of KP and Balochistan had been at war against terrorism for decades.
Mr Gandapur said his province’s police were bravely fighting against terrorists by endangering their lives, and rendered great sacrifices in the fight.
“We [KP police] are committed to eliminating terrorism and other crimes,” he said.
The police chief requested the federal and provincial governments to provide his department with funds to equip its force with modern weapons and facilities.

The incident took place when the ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan was talking to media persons after attending court proceedings. 
The PTI leader had petitioned the PHC over Aimal Wali’s remarks against the PHC chief justice.
When the petitioner came out of the court, the angry ANP workers attacked him and roughed him up with kicks and punches.
The scuffle turned the court premises into a battle ground and several flower pots were also broken in the melee. Later, Fazal Khan was rescued by the police personnel, who escorted him out of the PHC premises.

5,PHC directs Aimal to publicly regret speaking against judiciary,ANP leader insists he just complained about delay in hearing his petition.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday directed Awami National Party provincial chief Aimal Wali Khan, who faced contempt proceedings, to publicly “regret” launching a bitter diatribe against the judiciary.
Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan of a single-member bench observed that Mr Aimal not only tried to scandalise him (chief justice) but threatened the judiciary as well.
He added that such things didn’t happen in a civilised society and statements like the one given by the ANP leader caused a sense of insecurity among judges and their family members.
The chief justice observed that the issue was related to the judiciary and not him.
He added that the judges had no political agenda and that they treated all political parties alike.

ANP leader insists he just complained about delay in hearing into his petition

Mr Aimal told the bench that his remarks about the judiciary were harsh for which he said sorry.
He, however, insisted that he didn’t hurl any threat to judges but just complained about a delay in the fixing of his petition about the alleged resettlement of militants in the country.
The bench directed him to repeat that “regret” on his remarks in front of the media.
It pointed out that the petition he referred to was fixed for hearing twice but was adjourned at the request of his counsel.
The bench was hearing a petition filed by PTI leader and former MNA Fazal Mohammad Khan to seek contempt proceedings against Mr Aimal for punishment over his alleged diatribe against the chief justice and the judiciary.
The petitioner claimed that on Dec 21, the ANP leader, in interviews with national news channels, made some “gravely scandalous, malicious and defamatory” remarks against the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court.
Mr Aimal showed up in the court along with his counsel, including Barrister Amir Khan Chamkani, Ahmad Farooq Khattak, Babar Khan Yousafzai and others. The petitioner was represented by Barrister Sarwar Muzaffar Shah.
The chief justice observed that his judicial career spanned over 32 years and that his children were almost the same age as Mr Aimal.
He observed that if the respondent had issued any threats to him, he, as a Pakhtun like him, knew how to respond to it but wouldn’t do that for holding a position that demanded “tolerance and patience.”
Lawyers for Mr Aimal insisted that the issue was blown out of proportion as the petitioner was a political rival of their client.
They requested the bench to be lenient towards the respondent.
The bench observed that the act of threatening a judge was an offence under the Anti-Terrorism Act, but as the respondent was young, the court was treating him leniently.
Mr Aimal said he didn’t give a political statement and just wanted him to be treated like others.
The chief justice remarked that the court expected that Mr Aimal would behave responsibly for being a member of a family that rendered sacrifices for the country.
“Your grandfather (Abdul Wali Khan) and great grandfather (Abdul Ghaffar Khan) were considered forefathers of all the Pashtuns,” the chief justice told the ANP leader.
Mr Aimal said that he had not committed contempt of the court and even couldn’t think of doing so.
Advocate general Aamir Javed said political parties and their leaders should respect the courts as the issue didn’t pertain to a single judge or the court and instead it was about the entire judiciary.
The bench adjourned the hearing of the matter.
Meanwhile, Mr Aimal told media persons after the hearing that he still stood by his words that he was only complaining and was not threatening the court.
“My words might have been harsh but I was representing the entire nation and had certain reservations about the judiciary,” he said.
The ANP leader said for the independence of judiciary, his party’s activists had rendered sacrifices and a large number of their workers were killed in Karachi in 2007.
He said the chief justice sought certain clarifications about his statement and he did so.
Mr Aimal said he had filed a petition seeking the formation of a high-powered fact-finding committee on the “process of the resettlement of militants” and the surge caused by it in terrorist activities in the country.
He added that he wanted the court’s decision on that petition.

Addressing a press conference along with his party leaders and workers in Saidu Sharif on Thursday, he said that many people from other political parties were in contact with him and soon they would join his party. Pakistan Peoples Party leaders Anwar Zaman Khan and Qamar Zaman Khan along with their supporters joined PTI-P on the occasion.
Former provincial minister Muhibullah Khan, PTI-P provincial president Habib Ali Shah and other leaders were also present on the occasion. On occasion, PPP leaders Arsalan Khan, Jamshed Khan, Sarfraz Khan, Abid Ali Khan, Usman Ghani, Sohrab Khan, Jan Sher Khan, and QWP leader Nasrullah Khan along with their friends joined PTI-P.
Mahmood Khan said that he was excited after his cousins Anwar Zaman Khan and Qamar Zaman Khan joined PTI-P with their families. “Our family has once again united. Our party is stronger now as senior politicians joined it. We believe that we will serve our people in a better way after we come in power,” he said.
He said that he served people as a chief minister. “We carried out a record number of development projects during our tenure. On the basis of my past tenure, people in KP will vote for us,” he added.
The former chief minister said that PTI-P was getting stronger with each passing day as workers of different political parties including PTI were joining it in a large number. He said that PTI-P would nominate its candidates in the entire province except in some areas where it had an alliance with other political parties.
To a question regarding delay in elections, he said that he would accept it warmly if polls were delayed. “Those, who are sitting in Islamabad, make decisions but they don’t know about ground realities. In southern KP, law and order situation is not stable while in its northern parts, there would be snow. Both situations are not favourable for peaceful conduction of elections. However, our party is still ready to contest the elections on February 8,” he added.
He also denied that establishment was backing PTI-P. He said that he endorsed every positive role of establishment and was against its negative role.
Speaking on the occasion, Anwar Zaman said that he and his friends ended their 52-year association with PPP.

“We want the election environment to be fair and peaceful for all parties but creating a friendly atmosphere for some and unfriendly for others is unacceptable to us,” Mr Haideri told reporters after addressing a JUI-F ticket distribution ceremony here.
The JUI-F leader said the current situation in which leaders of a political party were favoured and those of others were warned about life threats would raise questions about the credibility of the upcoming elections.
He said his party didn’t accept “controversial” results of the 2018 elections and if the Feb 8 polls didn’t take place fairly, then it wouldn’t allow the “selected” ones to assume power.
Mr Haideri said his party’s chapters in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan were empowered by central emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman to decide about seat adjustment with other parties in their respective provincesbut that would happen on the basis of give and take. He claimed that his party would win elections overwhelmingly.
The JUI-F leader said his party’s emir advocated a “little delay” in polls due to harsh winter and a wave of terrorism in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that could deprive the residents of the right to vote.
“Though we have some reservations about the election schedule and even apprised authorities of them, we are ready to contest polls to claim a convincing victory,” he said.
Mr Haideri said after coming to power, his party would enforce Islamic law in the country and address economic and political challenges.
JUI-F leaders Abrar Hussain Tanoli alias Mohammad Iqbal, Maulana Nasir Mehmood, Maulana Saeed Abdullah, Fahd Habib Tanoli and others also addressed the gathering.
Earlier, Mr Haideri gave away papers of party tickets to aspirants for seven national and 18 provincial assembly seats in Mansehra, Haripur, Abbottabad, Torghar, Battagram, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts of Hazara division.

8,Election-related pleas referred to CJ for formation of larger bench,Petitions are mostly about eligibility of absconders to contest polls,"PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench on Thursday referred the petition of PTI leader Senator Azam Khan Swati against the rejection of his nomination papers and some other petitions to the Chief Justice for constituting a larger bench for hearing.
The development came after Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali heard several petitions against the rejection or acceptance of nomination papers, mostly revolving around the question about the eligibility of fugitives from justice to stand in elections.
It observed that as the petitions raised an important question of the law, the cases were referred to the chief justice for the formation of a larger bench.
The petitions included the one filed by Mr Swati, who is currently in hiding, against the decision of the returning officer of NA-15 Mansehra to reject his nomination papers and that of the Abbottabad election appellate tribunal to uphold it.
Similarly, three petitions were filed by PPP candidate in Swabidistrict Biland Khan, who challenged the acceptance of nomination papers of PTI leader and former provincial senior minister Shahram Khan Tarakai for Swabi’s NA- 20 and PK-52 and PK-53 seats.

Petitions are mostly about eligibility of absconders to contest polls

Two other petitions were filed by residents of Mardan, including Ahsanul Haq and Shahnam Mohammad, against the acceptance of appeals of former senior minister and PTI leader Mohammad Atif Khan by the election appellate tribunal and restoration of his candidature for NA- 22 Mardan and PK-59 Mardan.
The name of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader retired Captain Mohammad Safdar also appeared on the petition of Mr Swati. Mr Safdar objected to the nomination papers of Mr Swati before the returning officer and got them rejected.
Barrister Waqar Ali Khan appeared for Mr Swati and contended that his nomination papers were rejected on the ground of being charged in cases related to the May 9 violent protests. He argued that a candidate could not be disqualified on the said ground under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.
Mr Safdar’s counsel Manzoor Khalil contended that the petitioner was an absconder whose signatures were forged on a power of attorney given to a person for submitting his nomination papers.
Mr Safdar also alleged that Mr Swati was involved in attacks on national installations during May 9 protests.
Barrister Wiqar argued that appearing before a returning officer by a candidate in person was not mandatory. He added that the power of attorney was given by the petitioner to his grandson.
The lawyer referred to the case of Senator Ishaq Dar in the Supreme Court and insisted that the PML-N leader, despite being an absconder, contested the Senate polls.
Similarly, in the petitions filed against Shahram Khan Tarakai and Mohammad Atif Khan, the petitioners had adopted the plea that both of them had been absconding in cases but despite that, their nomination papers were accepted by the returning officers and the appellate tribunal, respectively.
Atif’s lawyer Barrister Qasim Wadud had contended before the appellate tribunal that his client nomination papers were rejected on the ground that he was nominated in an FIR registered for staging a protest by the PTI in Mardan. He had claimed that in the case, all former lawmakers of the PTI from Mardan had been charged.

Talking to reporters at Peshawar Press Club the other day, a group of teachers led by Jawad Khan said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had hired services of 297 lecturers in March 2021 to meet the shortage of teaching staff in the colleges.
On the occasion, Jawad Khan said the lecturers had been recruited under the Project Management Unit, who performed their duties diligently for the better future of children without caring for their lives in unfavourable conditions in the merged region.
He said with the appointment of these teachers 12 colleges, which had long been closed down, became functional. He said the credit went to the lectures, who worked devotedly to run the educational institutions in the far-flung areas.
The government, he said was bound to regularise their services, but instead it terminated services of 42 lecturers without any reason, putting the future of students at stake, and pushing teachers into financial hardship.
Jawad claimed under a Supreme Court order, the government employees who had served in public sector departments for three consecutive years could not be dismissed.
He said some of the teachers had reached the upper age limit, and had no other source of income to survive.
The sacked teachers demanded of the government to consider their case on humanitarian grounds and reinstate them.
