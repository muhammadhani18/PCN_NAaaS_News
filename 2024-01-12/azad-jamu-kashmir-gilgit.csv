2,Alvi orders compensation for fraud victim,President directs private insurance firm to refund Rs0.1m and profit,"President Dr Arif Alvi has instructed EFU Life Assurance Ltd to reimburse Rs100,000, along with the profit gained to the poor woman who was deceived into acquiring the insurance policy.
According to a press release issued by the President House Press Wing on Thursday, Zubaida Begum had obtained an amount of Rs100,000 by participating in a local ‘committee’ and intended to deposit the amount in her bank account, but she was fraudulently issued an insurance policy at the bank.
When expressed her inability to pay an annual premium of Rs100,000 and asked for a refund of her deposit, she was told that she would only be refunded an amount of Rs40,000 as per the policy of the bank.
Feeling aggrieved, she approached the Federal Insurance Ombudsman (FIO) but her grievance was not addressed. Later, she filed a representation with the president against the decision of FIO. The president personally heard the case of the aggrieved lady, and after going through the record, decided the matter in her favour.

In his decision, he observed that the complainant was entitled at least to the refund of the principal amount as her claim was just and fair. He added that the mis-selling of the policy to the poor lady who never opted to purchase the policy in the first place and thereafter the denial of the refund of the deposited premium amount by the company constituted maladministration.
The president noted that FIO had directed the insurance company to refund Rs40,000 to the woman, without acknowledging the fact that an amount of Rs60,000 was remaining to be paid by the company. He said as per Insurance Ordinance 2000, FIO was to ensure the protection of the interests of insurance policyholders, and non-refund of even the deposited amount by the insurance company was a sheer violation of the spirit of the Ordinance.
He stated that FIO had failed to follow the spirit of the Ordinance and had not realised that Rs100,000 had been kept by the company since 2020 and that they must also have earned a considerable profit on it by investing it. The president wrote that the equitable principle of enrichment envisaged that no one should unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of others.

4,Women spearhead Pindi poll drive,Political parties begin election campaigns with subdued enthusiasm,"In the run-up to the general elections for the seven national and 14 provincial assembly seats in the Rawalpindi district, slated for February 8, political candidates are actively enlisting the support of women workers and educated females for door-to-door campaigning.
These women workers, compensated between Rs1500 to Rs2500 per day, primarily hailing from Pashtun, Kashmiri, Punjabi and Potohari hill communities are being prioritised to effectively convey party manifestos and seek votes from potential voters.
This strategic selection is rooted in the substantial population of Pashtun, Kashmiri, Potohari, and Punjabi families in Rawalpindi constituencies, ensuring seamless communication in their respective languages. In a bid to bolster these efforts, political parties are establishing dedicated election offices for women workers, offering amenities such as food, tea, and green tea.
It is worth noting that female teachers are the preferred choice for all the candidates, and unemployed women and youths are being engaged for a month in connection with the electoral activities. The recruitment drive is unfolding at the grassroots level, with each union council witnessing the enlistment of 10 to 15 women.

Moreover, a decision has been made to hire 200 to 250 women in each constituency. These women will undergo training to serve as female polling agents on the polling day, receiving a separate compensation of Rs3,300 for this specific duty. Their responsibilities encompass distributing party manifestos and vote slips door-to-door, contributing to a comprehensive outreach strategy.
Subdued tone
Meanwhile, the election campaign has commenced in the Rawalpindi district with a subdued tone with candidates initiating the setup of their election offices. The political landscape is transforming with the emergence of Panaflex and election banners on rickshaws, cars, marketplaces and significant thoroughfares.
Candidates from all parties are actively participating in local events, including weddings and funerals, across the district. With the receipt of the polling scheme, candidates are engaged in the meticulous task of re-evaluating their constituencies, considering new additions, divisions and changes in voter lists.
This process has led to the restructuring of several constituencies, causing frustration among the candidates. Further, the inclusion of additional areas and voters has heightened anxiety among them.
Surge in workload
On the other hand, the surge in workload and rush hour has put pressure on printing presses responsible for producing election posters, banners, and stickers. These printing presses have responded by increasing their rates by up to 30 per cent.
Candidates have placed thousands of production orders for Panaflex and stickers of various sizes, resulting in substantial profits for Panaflex producers across the city. Despite the fervour, no political party has yet made a prominent display of strength throughout the entire city.
Candidates are navigating crowded markets and encountering significant challenges in the early stages of the polling campaign. The political atmosphere is gaining momentum with the return of prominent figures from the election tribunals.
Talking to The Express Tribune, locals said they were anticipating an increase in election-related activities over the next two to three days.

5,Traders voice concerns over inflated gas bills,Traders warn of staging protest and government to bear consequences,"All Pakistan Anjuman-e-Tajran President Ajmal Baloch along with the ICCI Traders Welfare Committee Secretary and Convener Khalid Chaudhry have expressed serious concerns over the escalating gas bills. They said it was adding to the distress of consumers already grappling with the burden of inflation.
They underscored the challenges faced by individuals choosing to pay high bills in instalments, as they are compelled to pay extra charges alongside the instalment payments. According to their observations, when people attempt to convert their bills into instalments, the Sui Gas authorities frequently reject their requests due to which the consumers are forced to turn to agents through bribery.

They pointed out that, small restaurants in Islamabad, particularly those that offer naan and bread, are compelled to sell bread at inflated prices due to the high cost of gas. They urged the prime minister to promptly issue directives for relief in gas bills and extend support to small restaurants, following the tariff structure of tandoors.
They warned that if the govt failed to provide relief, traders would be compelled to stage protests and the govt would have to bear the consequences.

6,Teachers rejoice regularisation,Public educators in ICT have long served in temporary positions,"As many as 227 teachers working in the educational institutions of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) are rejoicing as they transition from daily-wage teachers to secure regular appointments.
Public teachers have long served in temporary positions and now finally find themselves with the security of a permanent position.
This comes after the federal cabinet approved the regular appointment of 227 daily-wage teachers following a ruling by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The move follows a comprehensive summary presented by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training (MOFE&PT) and the recommendations of the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC). MOFE&PT presented its summary in November 2023, in which it sought the regularisation of 227 daily-wage teachers. The IHC then mandated the federal cabinet to approve the decision in its verdict.
Read: https://tribune.com.pk/story/2439558/over-600-teachers-challenge-hiring-process
The appointment of the teachers to permanent positions was facilitated through the rigorous processes of written tests and interviews conducted by the Federal Public Service Commission. The notification of their appointments has been eagerly awaited since then, bringing relief and joy to teachers who have longed for the day they would be officially designated as permanent members of the teaching faculty.
Expressing his happiness on the momentous occasion, one of the newly appointed teachers conveyed his excitement by saying, “This regularisation has not just brought joy to my life but also a sense of much-needed security. This is a recognition of our hard work and dedication to shaping the future generation.”

7,Capital’s waste to be dumped at Losar landfill site,"Citizens reject decision, vow to move environment tribunal today","The Islamabad district administration has won approval to dump garbage collected from the federal capital territory near Losar – a suburb of Rawalpindi district – despite the appeals made by citizens.
About 600 kanals of land next to the existing garbage dump at Losar has been chosen as a garbage disposal area for trash coming in from the neighbouring capital city. This development comes after the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Punjab upheld the decision of the Joint Public Hearing Committee of the Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) and the Islamabad district administration.
However, the residents of the area have announced to challenge this decision. The decision will be contested in the tribunal to be held on Friday (today).
The dumping ground at Losar was built in 2010. It covers 600 kanals of land. Garbage collected from the entire Rawalpindi district has been dumped there for the past 15 years. The trash is disposed of untreated and gathered at the site in exposed piles which leads to various diseases of the nose, ears, throat and eyes that pose a potential threat for the 200,000 residents of the area.
Last year in February 2023, the Rawalpindi commissioner approved the CDA’s request, not only allowing them to dump garbage at Losar but also granting them another 600 kanals of land for the dump’s expansion. This move was protested against by citizens of the area.
Citizens’ Action Committee, Chairman, Fayyaz Shah Gilani, said, “The local population in Losar is extremely upset with the garbage dumping ground. In the February 8 elections, we will only cast votes for the candidate who promises to remove this dumping ground from here, otherwise, the entire population of the area will boycott the elections.”
“These are our ancestral lands and we will not give them up to Islamabad as a garbage dumping ground. Islamabad has a lot of land lying idle. Its district administration should build its dumping ground within its areas instead of dumping its garbage in the Rawalpindi district,” he added.
