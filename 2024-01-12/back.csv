0,PML-N seeks action against Justice Ahsan,Marriyum blames him and ex- judge Naqvi for country’s woes,"Unsatisfied with the resignations of the top jurists who it had criticised for giving judgments against its leaders, the PML-N on Thursday demanded that Supreme Court’s Justice Ijazul Ahsan must be held accountable and subjected to legal action.
Addressing a news conference following the resignation of Justice Ahsan, the senior puisne judge who the PML-N saw as a hurdle for its upcoming government, party’s central information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb said his stepping down from the post was an admission of the allegations against him.
She added that a mere resignation could not exonerate the judge from his “terrible actions” against the people's elected leaders, democracy, and Constitution. Marriyum stressed that a resignation would not bury a plethora of controversial decisions and references against Justice Ahsan.
“The people of Pakistan demand that he [Justice Ahsan] must be held accountable for his actions in accordance with the law and merits of justice,” she continued.
The former federal information minister, while referring to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, raised the question that if a three-time elected premier could present himself, his entire family as well as political party for the most rigorous process of accountability, even in the circumstances primed for persecution and victimisation, why should any SC judge be exempted.

The PML-N leader lashed out at Justice Ahsan for making a mockery of justice, the SC and the office of top court judge just to target, persecute, and victimise Nawaz.
“Today Nawaz Sharif is being vindicated and the bench that persecuted him is eventually facing its destiny,” she added. Marriyum maintained that individuals including Justice Ahsan and former SC judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, who had resigned a day earlier, were responsible for the economic destruction of Pakistan, massive unemployment, and excruciating inflation.
“They must answer to the people for their ‘deplorable’ actions,” she demanded. The PML-N leader claimed that this “like-minded group” of individuals used its power, position and influence to target Nawaz.
Marriyum continued that these individuals had forgotten that power and position were a sacred trust of the people and temporary. “The resignation of these judges is proof that they were guilty of all these horrendous crimes against the nation and Constitution,” she added.
“Black sheep like Ijazul Ahsan and Mazahar Ali Naqvi cause institutional turmoil with their actions,” she claimed, continuing that the SC was being strengthened with the exit of such people.
Marriyum also criticised the Peshawar High Court’s decision to reinstate PTI's electoral symbol of the ‘cricket bat’ despite the party “grossly violating” the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) rules and code of conduct.

The PML-N leader maintained that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had proved once again through his party's “false” internal elections that he only believed in rigged and manipulated process of selection instead of holding democratic polls.
She added that Imran’s premiership and the PTI government became possible by rigging through the manipulation of the Results Transmission System (RTS). The ex-federal information minister claimed that Imran had become accustomed to winning the polls through rigging.
However, she did not comment on the PTI’s electoral symbol -- the ‘cricket bat’. PML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah also spoke on this development. He said all parties should be given the concession of not holding internal polls.
Sanaullah maintained that the PHC’s decision had made the Election Act, 2017 redundant. He continued that the decision was a victory for the violation of rules and defeat for the law.
“The decision proves that they still favour the ‘blue-eyed’,” he claimed, referring to Imran. The former interior minister said the PHC’s decision was an encouragement of the perpetrators of last year’s violence on May 9.

1,Political parties get e-commerce savvy ahead of elections,"Following PTI lead, PML-N launches online store, offering party-branded merchandise","As Pakistan's February 8th general elections approach, major political parties are adopting innovative online strategies to garner support and resources. Following the lead of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has launched its own online store, offering party-branded merchandise and a platform for fans to showcase their support.
PML-N's official X (formerly Twitter) handle announced the launch with a call to action: “Get ready for #Elections2024 and show your support for #PMLN! We're excited to announce the official launch of PMLN merchandise at http://pmlnstore.com. Show your support and pride for PMLN by grabbing your brand-new t-shirts, caps, hoodies, mugs, badges, and more!”
Read PML-N revs up election drive
Initially, the store features 13 items, including apparel and mugs emblazoned with party slogans like ""Sher Ek Vari Fer,"" ""Dekho Dekho Kon Aaya,"" and ""Mian Day Naary Wajan Gy."" This merchandise-focused approach contrasts with PTI's online strategy, which prioritises fundraising.
PTI launched two websites, pakistanbadlo.com and pakistanbadlo.ptioverseas.com, specifically targeting local and overseas Pakistanis, respectively. These platforms focus on soliciting donations to cover campaign expenses through various denomination cards ranging from Rs500 to Rs150,000. The cards categorise contributions under headings like ""flag and outdoors"", ""polling agents"", and ""online media campaigns"", providing donors with transparency in their support.
Read PML-N revitalises party structure for election
PTI launched these websites during a virtual election fundraiser last Sunday, and despite a nationwide internet and social media blackout in Pakistan, managed to raise a staggering Rs100 million from local and overseas supporters within just a few hours.
This digital push from both parties highlights the evolving landscape of Pakistani politics, where online engagement and resource mobilisation are playing increasingly crucial roles. As the race to February 8 heats up, it will be interesting to see how other parties leverage technology to connect with voters and navigate the increasingly tech-savvy Pakistani electorate.

3,PayPal payments for freelancers from Feb,"E-Rozgar centres to boost digital productivity, says IT minister","Caretaker Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication Dr. Umar Saif on Thursday said that under the pilot project, 10,000 freelancers would start receiving payments from PayPal in February.
Addressing a Tech Destination Pakistan event that featured the launch of E-Rozgar Centers in the country, he said, “In February, we are going to start the first pilot project in which 10,000 freelancers in Pakistan would be able to start receiving payments through PayPal.”
The minister further mentioned that in March, the program would be scaled up and everyone would have access to payments from PayPal and Stripe across the country.
He clarified that while PayPal itself is not coming to Pakistan, an agreement has been reached where remittances would be channeled through PayPal via a third party.
Under the newly devised program, the freelancers will not need to open a PayPal account. Instead, individuals outside the country will make payments from their PayPal accounts, and the funds will be promptly deposited into the freelancers’ accounts, the minister explained.
The minister said that the government has devised a mechanism for the opening of bank accounts for freelancers. He mentioned that only freelancers would have to provide evidence that they have an account on Fiverr, Upwork, Elance, Toptal, or Crossover.
The minister added, “The IT industry would have a 50 percentdollar retention policy, which means that whatever you earn, you can keep 50 percent of that in dollars. You will get a debit card from that bank so that you can freely spend that money domestically or internationally.”
He highlighted that the government has allocated enough funds for the establishment of E-Rozgaar centers across the country through a public-private partnership mode, facilitating an interest-free loan to shortlisted/qualified individuals and companies.
He said that the main objective behind the E-Rozgaar centers is to provide state-of-the-art infrastructure to enhance freelancers’ productivity and bolster Pakistan’s digital ecosystem.
Under the program, more than 250 E-Rozgaar Pakistan centers would be established through the public and private sectors.
He said that the initiative would foster inclusivity in the digital, financial, and economic sectors by cultivating a culture of freelancing and entrepreneurship in Pakistan.
Currently, he informed that work on almost 40 E-Rozgaar centers is in progress, and it is expected that all these E-Rozgaar centers shall be made operational by 19th February 2024.
Dr. Umar Saif said that the first standardized quality test for the 75,000 information technology graduates would be conducted on January 15.
He highlighted significant decisions made to revamp IT education in collaboration with various entities, including HEC, the National Computing Accreditation Council, the Examination Testing Council, the Pakistan Software Export Board, and the Pakistan Software Houses Association.
Dr Saif said students who successfully pass the test will be offered job opportunities through the Industry Placement Program. He added that funds will be allocated to support special industry courses in universities, aiming to prepare students for current industry trends and needs.
He mentioned that the students would get a stipend from the government, and the companies that give them apprenticeships would get cash awards from the government.
At the same time, he said, the IT industry also needs highly skilled manpower, which is certified by international enterprise platforms Google’s and Microsoft’s, Cisco’s. “So this year, we’re going to train 16,000 people. These are people who already have IT skills but need international certifications in technologies like Salesforce, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle financials, etc,” he added.
He said the government, under the SIFC, had taken some radical steps to facilitate the IT firms, which helped increase IT revenue by 13 percent during the last month.
Federal IT Secretary Hassan Nasir Jami said within a short period, the IT ministry had introduced multiple initiatives to enhance IT exports and facilitate freelancers.
He said the IT ministry was committed to developing an IT ecosystem and called upon entrepreneurs, students, and developers to take advantage of opportunities available

4,Poll says Imran leads approval ratings,"Gallup Pakistan says Nawaz’s ratings improved, with gap between PML-N and PTI narrowing","Despite being in jail, former prime minister Imran Khan led the approval ratings for political leaders at the national level, with three times former prime minister Nawaz Sharif narrowly behind him, the Gallup Pakistan’s survey finding revealed on Thursday.
Though Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) founder is leading the survey, the survey findings have showed that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif’s ratings have improved, while Imran’s ratings have remained consistent more or less.
Also, the survey results stated that the gap between the PML-N and the PTI has been narrowing in the last eight months, slowly and consistently, as shown by surveys done in March, June, November and December 2023.
The organisation said that the sample size of the latest round of survey marked as December 2023 throughout the report was around 5,000 men and women. Between June and December, 2023, the survey said, the gap between Imran and Nawaz in terms of approval rating has reduced considerably.
Just a month before the general elections, the Gallup Pakistan issued its political weather report for 2024, carrying key findings about political leaders and parties, among other things. In terms of approval ratings for leaders, it read, Imran leads with Nawaz narrowly behind at the national level.

“Within Punjab,” it said, “Nawaz Sharif [is] ahead of Imran Khan.” It added that while Nawaz’s ratings had improved, Imran’s remained almost consistent. The survey showed that the gap between PML-N and PTI has been narrowing in the last eight months slowly but consistently.
In March 2023, the gap between PML-N and PTI was 21% in Punjab with PTI in the lead. The gap is now around 2% in December 2023 surveys. In the crucial 30 days up to the election in February 2024, it adds, it would be important to see if the trend continues or is reversed.
In Punjab, the electoral contest one month before the election seems competitive and close to general election 2018 situation in terms of popular voting intentions. The survey said that 34% and 32% of surveyed voters in December 2023 said they would vote for the PTI and the PML-N, respectively.
The gap between the two parties is 2%, it noted, which is within the error margin of the survey and statistically insignificant. In Punjab, it said, different regions showed varying support for the two main parties – PTI led with reasonable margin in north Punjab, but was neck-to-neck in west and central Punjab.
Read Why Is Imran Khan's 'Bat' Symbol So Special?
The PML-N seems to be in a lead in south Punjab and the PPP also having reasonable support there. “In central Punjab,” it said, “The TLP [Tehreek-e-Labbaik, Pakistan] had a spoiler vote.” Since north Punjab was 10% of total Punjab seats, it maintained, it was safe to say that electoral race was quite competitive.
In Sindh, the Gallup Pakistan said, het PPP was the largest political party with the PTI being the second. “The PPP leads in Sindh over other parties,” it read. However, it added, its support was less strong in Karachi region as opposed to the interior or rural Sindh.
In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), the report said, the PTI was in lead but would have considerable challenges given the emergence of alliances, adding that 45% of the voters surveyed in K-P in December 2023 claimed that they would like to vote for PTI.
In general election 2018, it said, the PTI had a vote share of 37%, meaning “there is a rise in the PTI popularity”, however not very significant. Vote of parties other than PTI was concentrated in different regions, which could help them win seats despite lagging behind in terms of KP-wide popular vote.
For example, the JUI-F has significant vote share in south K-P and the PML-N has significant vote share in Hazara. The survey added that an alliance between parties can, therefore, give a reasonable competition to the PTI in various territories.

5,Govt to challenge law protecting retired judges,Ex-SC judge Naqvi’s lawyer tells SJC no action can be taken against his client,"The interim federal government on Friday decided to challenge the law granting amnesty to former judges after Justice (retd) Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi’s lawyer told the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) that no legal action could be taken against his client now that he had tendered his resignation.
A meeting of the SJC, presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, took up the complaints of misconduct against Justice (retd) Naqvi.
The SJC had issued a notice to the Supreme Court judge and his lawyer Khawaja Haris after which Justice Naqvi stepped down from his post.
The registrar read out the reply sent by Naqvi’s lawyer that stated that the council could only take action against a serving judge, and not a retired one.
The assistant lawyer of Naqvi’s counsel told the SJC that Haris was arriving in Islamabad from Lahore and no action should be taken against the former SC judge as he had resigned from his post.
The attorney general for Pakistan said the government would challenge the SC decision in the case of civil society activist Afiya Shehrbano’s complaint against then CJP Mian Saqib Nisar under Article 209 of the Constitution over alleged breach of the judges’ code of conduct.
A two-judge bench of the SC in its verdict had observed that an errant judge could not be removed from their office in case they had already retired or resigned.
CJP Isa observed that the verdict of the Afiya Shehrbano case read that only the SJC could act against a judge.
He added that the case would be heard again after the February 8 elections, preferably on the 15th, 16th or 17th of the month.
Later, the SJC proceedings were adjourned till February 15. In its order issued on Friday, the SJC wrote that the AGP had said he was filing an appeal against the Afiya Shehrbano case verdict.
It added that the AGP had also told the council that he was taking this step on the instruction of the interim federal government.
The order continued that the SJC meeting was being adjourned for now and would be held again at 11am on February 15.
Naqvi, who faces charges of misconduct, resigned two days ago as a judge of the SC, saying it was no longer possible for him to continue holding this position.
He is accused of misconduct and embroiled in ongoing proceedings at the SJC in this connection. Ten complaints accusing the former judge of misconduct are pending in the SJC

6,Paying price for saying ‘absolutely not’: Imran,"Those who conspired face no charges, while those who exposed it are being punished, lawyer quotes ex-PM as saying"," 
Incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan’s lawyer, Naeem Haider Panjutha, quoted his client as saying that he was paying the price for unequivocally stating “absolutely not”.
In an interview with Jonathan Swan of 'Axios on HBO' in 2021, Imran, who was prime minister at that time, had said that Pakistan would ""absolutely not"" allow any bases and use of its territory for any sort of action inside Afghanistan.
""Absolutely not. There is no way we are going to allow any bases, any sort of action from Pakistani territory into Afghanistan. Absolutely not,"" he had said.
The term attained iconic status, emerging as a talking point among his supporters, particularly in the realm of social media discussions.
“May only fault is saying absolutely not. I was told that I would be charged under the Official Secrets Act, but I stood my ground for genuine freedom,” Panjutha quoted Imran as saying after meeting him in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.
Panjootha shared details of his conversation with Imran Khan, quoting the PTI leader as saying that small thieves do not face any punishment, while big thieves are given a clean chit.
“There is no case against those who conspired. In contrast, the one who exposed the conspiracy is being punished,” he added.
Imran said that Aun Chaudhry, a former close confidante, is being presented as a witness. “The people who are trying to keep us away from elections are being presented as witnesses. What significance does such a testimony hold,” he questioned.
On Toshakhana case, Imran was quoted as saying: ""Our requests related to the Toshakhana case have been pending in the high court for 12 months. Neither are our requests being withdrawn nor are the cases proceeding.""
Imran Khan said that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif has effectively ended his political career.
On May 9 case, the former prime minister was quoted as saying that why the CCTV footage of Islamabad High Court and Judicial Complex is not being presented, demanding that the event of May 9 should be thoroughly investigated.

8,Pakistan’s growth to hit 2.4% in FY25: WB,Report says monetary policy expected to remain tight to contain inflation,"The World Bank (WB) has said Pakistan’s economic outlook from July 2023 to June 2024 would remain bleak and projected its growth at only 1.7% but it was expected to pick up to 2.4% in the fiscal year 2024-25 with the easing of inflationary pressure.
In its report titled ‘Global Economic Prospects — January 2024’, the WB shared that the country’s monetary policy was expected to remain tight to contain inflation, while fiscal policy was also set to contract -- reflecting pressures from high debt-service payments.
The global financial institution further predicted that weak confidence stemming from political turmoil would contribute to slow growth in private demand.
The WB warned that the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 parliamentary elections in the country and polls in South Asia might affect foreign investment in the region.
According to the report, elections are scheduled in various countries of South Asia including India, Maldives and Pakistan in 2024. The polls in Bangladesh have already taken place.

The WB predicted that with pre-election spending rising, especially in countries with weak financial positions, it would increase their fiscal vulnerability at the macro level, adding that their prospects of growth would improve after the polls and end of uncertain policies.
The report pointed out that the output in Pakistan contracted an estimated 0.2% in the FY22-23 as a result of the effects of damage caused by the 2022 floods and increased political uncertainty.
“Consumer price inflation remained elevated, partly reflecting currency depreciation in early 2023. However, by late 2023, the rupee showed signs of stabilisation, driven by a variety of factors,” the report read.
Read  Markets confident about approval of IMF tranche
“These [factors] included increased liquidity in the foreign exchange market due to tighter enforcement of regulations, a shrinking money supply, a balance-of-payments surplus on account of low import demand, and a moratorium on Chinese debt repayments,” it added.
The WB highlighted that low-income households would spend more on food, increasing the prices of edibles. This might have a disproportionate impact on the poor and disadvantaged, leading to further poverty as well as inequality.
It continued that this risk was particularly high in countries that had very little fiscal buffer to offset these adverse impacts, including Nepal and Pakistan.
Besides, these countries also include those facing security threats and Afghanistan was among them.
Growth in South Asia is expected to edge slightly lower to a still-robust 5.6% pace in 2024, before firming to 5.9% next year. Domestic demand, including public consumption and investment, will remain major drivers of economic growth. A pickup in external demand, albeit still subdued, is also expected to contribute to growth.

9,SJC unmoved by Naqvi’s resignation,Council to continue proceedings on complaints filed against former SC judge,"Unmoved by the resignation of former Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has decided to continue misconduct proceedings against him. The council has noted that Naqvi may attend the proceedings either in person or through a representative.
Naqvi handed in his resignation on Wednesday ahead of the SJC’s meeting, citing personal reasons. This development occurred a day after a Supreme Court bench rejected his request to stay the ongoing misconduct proceedings at the SJC.
When the SJC's resumed hearing on the complaints against Naqvi, a council member, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, did not show up. It later transpired that Justice Ahsan, in line to become the next chief justice of Pakistan, had also resigned from his post.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa, who leads the SJC, directed Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan to read Justice Naqvi’s resignation during the proceedings.
Read After Justice Naqvi, Justice Ijazul Ahsan resigns as SC judge
He asked, ""What does Article 179 of the Constitution say about resignation?"" When the AGP read Article 179, the CJ requested him to also read Article 209 in the context of resignation.
Noting Justice Ahsan's absence, CJ Isa stated, “After Justice Ahsan, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah is the most senior judge in the apex court. Let’s inquire about his availability. If Shah is available, the council's proceedings will be advanced,” as he adjourned the council briefly.
The council resumed proceedings after Justice Shah joined as the fifth member. Justice Isa mentioned that Naqvi's resignation came after the issuance of a second show-cause notice in the final stage of the proceedings. He added that there could be two scenarios for the judge's resignation.
“In the first scenario, the complaints against the judge were false, and upon facing pressure, the judge resigned. In the second scenario, the allegations against the judge were true, and the judge did not want to confront them,” he said.
The CJ declared that the question of the judge's removal was irrelevant after his resignation. He mentioned that the council has only sent a report to the president so far, and it would write to the president to sack the judge if the allegations were proven. However, Justice Isa noted that the council will have to present its findings despite the judge’s resignation.

“If a Supreme Court judge resigns by damaging the institution, will it not pose a threat to us? How can we perform surgery on our own damaged institution?”
CJ Isa stated that the Constitution is not for judges and bureaucrats but for the people of Pakistan. He asked, ""Can we determine and proceed with further action?""Justice Isa also rejected the claim made by Justice Ahsan in a note on Tuesday that the SJC was in haste to conclude the proceeding against Justice Naqvi.
He said the council was not informed by the former judge's lawyers regarding the judge's resignation. “Our time is an entrustment. Moreover, some members of the bench come to Islamabad from different provinces to attend the meeting.” The council later issued a notice to the former judge as it adjourned till 11:15 am today [Friday].
