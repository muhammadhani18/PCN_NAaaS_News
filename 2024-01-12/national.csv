1,"Only PPP capable of knocking out poverty, says Bilawal","Expresses hope Feb 8 polls will pave way for a jiyala PM and Punjab CM; vows to save people from ""anti-poor"" parties.","TOBA TEK SINGH: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday said that Peoples Party alone could tackle the issues of poverty and unemployment as other parties were settling their personal vendettas with their leaders contesting elections either to avoid going to jail or to come out of the detention.
“We are contesting the polls to save people from poverty and unemployment,” he declared at an election rally at Tandlianwala in Faisalabad.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that except PPP no other mainstream political parties had made their manifesto public.
 






“We have the manifesto of Shaheed Quaid-i-Awam (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto who gave us an ideology. We have a 10-point economic agenda for welfare of people to be implemented with the support of the masses.”
He expressed the hope that a jiyala would be prime minister while another would be chief minister of Punjab after the Feb 8 elections. He said some forces were under the impression that by martyring Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto they could eliminate PPP, crush the poor and check the advance of jiyalas.

Expresses hope Feb 8 polls will pave way for a jiyala PM and Punjab CM; vows to save people from ‘anti-poor’ parties

“I want to give a message to them that we are not the ones who bow down and retreat,” he declared, adding “we are ready to contest against all political forces and prove that the ‘Bhutto of Punjab’ is still alive and we will snatch back our rights. We will save people from the anti-poor, anti-grower and anti-masses parties that have been imposed on Punjab.”
He said credit went to the people of Faisalabad for making Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto prime ministers through the power of their vote making the two leaders of the poor, labourers, growers and youth.
He expressed the hope that people would again vote for the establishment of an awami government.
“If you support us the way you supported Shaheed Quaid-i-Awam and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, we will once again tackle the issues of poverty, inflation and unemployment,” he promised.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari directed the workers to knock at every door and tell people that PPP, if voted to power, would offer 300 units of electricity to the poor free-of-cost, provide free quality education, and free quality health facilities so that people won’t need to go abroad for treatment.
He said women workers should apprise people of PPP’s plan to expand the scope of Benazir Income Support Programme incorporating more features and schemes. He said three million houses would be built for the poor who don’t their own shelter and slums would be regularised with ownership rights for women members of the households.
He said the young generation should be convinced not to ‘waste’ their votes and use their right to franchise for bringing in a government headed by a young prime minister to resolve their issues.
The youth, he added, would be able to acquire interest-free loans through a youth card, while a scheme for eliminating hunger would also be launched at the union council level.

2,Sharifs’ ‘limited allocation’ leaves IPP in a lurch,"PML-N angers own potential candidates by ""obliging turncoats""; PML-Q ""content"" with four seats; Daniyal Aziz to run independently.","• PML-N angers own potential candidates by ‘obliging turncoats’
• PML-Q ‘content’ with four seats, two each for NA and PA
• Daniyal Aziz to run independently from NA-75 against PML-N’s Anwaarul Haq
• Talal Chaudhry ‘makes sacrifice’ for PTI deserter, promised Senate ticket
• Farah Khan’s father-in-law also gets PML-N ticket
LAHORE: The Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), home for PTI deserters, faced a setback on Thursday as the PML-N allocated them only a limited number of seats for the next month’s general elections.
The Sharifs’ party has announced its candidates for most National and Punjab assembly seats across the province, favouring electables from the south and PTI defectors.
In some constituencies, some potential PML-N candidates protested against the leadership for depriving them of tickets to oblige “turncoats” and others by compromising on its so-called principles.
PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who helped the PML-N-led coalition in the ouster of Imran Khan in 2022, is accommodated with just four seats, two each for the National and Punjab assemblies. The PML-N left NA-64 and PP-31 Gujrat open for Salik and Shafey, sons of Shujaat Hussain.
Interestingly, the PML-Q seems content with this arrangement, perhaps taking solace in the IPP’s treatment at the hands of PML-N.
The PML-N has left seven National and 11 Punjab constituencies open for IPP’s top leaders, including Jahangir Khan Tareen (from Multan), Aleem Khan (Lahore), Amir Kiyani (Islamabad), Ghulam Sarwar (Taxila), Awn Chaudhry (Lahore), Nauman Langrial (Sahiwal).
 
 

The IPP did not give its reaction to the PML-N’s decision. IPP Information Secretary Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan did not respond to Dawn’s queries over its “poor” seat adjustment deal.
The PML-N has also refused to accommodate Ms Awan on NA-70 Sialkot and awarded a ticket to party stalwart Armaghan Subhani.
A PML-N insider told Dawn that had the Sharifs not had the pressure of the powers that be, they would not even have given that number of seats to the IPP. Interestingly, the IPP had initially sought over 100 NA and PA seats from the PML-N, which it had termed a “non-serious” demand.
The other major issue the IPP may face in the constituencies it secured tickets from PML-N in seat adjustment is whether the latter’s voters will vote for the former’s candidates in the Feb 8 polls.
Earlier, in the by-polls in Punjab in 2022, the PML-N had claimed that the PTI deserters who had its backing lost to Mr Khan’s PTI because PML-N workers would not campaign for them and its supporters stayed away from casting votes in their favour.
Notable among those who failed to get PML-N’s tickets are Daniyal Aziz from Narowal, Saud Majid from Bahawalpur and Talal Chaudhry from Jaranwala.
 
 

PML-N Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal prevailed on Mr Aziz and got two tickets from Narowal for NA-76 and PP-56 seats.
Mr Aziz has announced contesting independently on NA-75, from where the PML-N has awarded a ticket to Chaudhry Anwaarul Haq. Mr Aziz said his wife would also contest independently for a provincial assembly seat in Narowal.
Once a loyalist of the party, Daniyal Aziz had fallen out with the Sharifs over constantly ignoring him during the last few years.
Talal Chaudhry, who had the backing of the party chief organiser Maryam Nawaz, was made to sacrifice for a PTI deserter, Malik Nawab Sher Waseer.
The party sources said that the Sharifs had promised the dejected Mr Talal a Senate ticket.
On NA-77 Gujranwala, former MNA Mehmood Bashir Virk, who has the backing of the Maryam group, got the party ticket while the party’s deputy secretary general Attaullah Tarar, who was keen to contest from his hometown seat, was adjusted at NA-127 in Lahore against PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
There is word in the party that Mr Tarar got Lahore’s seat for his good relations with the quarters concerned and PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif.
From Faisalabad’s NA-104, the PML-N awarded a ticket to PTI deserter and former “sham” opposition leader in the National Assembly, Raja Riaz, who later joined the Sharifs. PML-N loyalist Rana Ehsan Khan is reportedly upset over the leadership’s decision for this constituency.
The PTI deserters given NA seats in the south include Basit Bokhari and Amir Gopang from Muzaffargarh, Amjad Kalara from Layyah and Abdul Qadir Khosa from D.G. Khan.
Ayesha Rajab Baloch, a former PML-N lawmaker from Faisalabad, was also denied a party ticket. She reportedly announced contesting the elections independently.
Chaudhry Iqbal Gujjar, the father-in-law of Bushra Bibi’s confidant, Farah Khan, also managed to get a provincial assembly ticket from Gujranwala.
 
 

The PML-N has refused to oblige PML-Q’s Wajahat Hussain and his son Musa Elahi on National Assembly seats in Gujrat who were reportedly forced to change their loyalty from PTI.
Until late in the night, the PML-N had not awarded tickets from Lahore.
Sources said the PML-N was taking a last-minute decision on two most sought-after constituencies — NA-121 and NA-117.
On NA-121, there is a fight between Sheikh Rohail Asghar and Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
Sources said the Sharifs told Mr Sadiq that he would be considered for the Senate’s top slot if he happily withdrew from contesting for this seat.
On NA-119, both Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Aleem Khan are keen to contest. However, Mr Khan would have to move to NA-117 as Ms Sharif is reportedly not ready to leave this constituency.

3,GB lawyers body urges action on basic rights case,Bar council calls for early hearing of pending case in SC regarding the im­­plementation of its verdict on the basic rights of the region.,"GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltis­tan Bar Council has urged Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa for an early hearing on a pending case in the Sup­reme Court regarding the im­­plementation of its verdict on the basic rights of the region.
In a letter to CJP Isa and other judges, the GB Bar Council (GBBC) stated that the citizens of Gilgit-Baltistan, as part of Pak­i­stan, have filed various constitutional petitions to enforce their fundamental rights.
It said that the Supreme Court had issu­­ed a verdict on Jan 17, 2019, giving the federal government two weeks to promulgate the “Gilgit-Baltis­tan Reforms Order 2019”.
The federal government filed a petition seeking more time for implementation.
In April 2020, the Supreme Court directed the registrar to schedule the main case after the Eidul Fitr break, along with miscellaneous applications, it added.
The letter requested the court to fix the case after winter vacations.
Simultaneously, a resolution passed by the GBBC urg­ed the Supreme Court to set the case for an early hearing.
A meeting of GBBC officebearers was held in December 2023, chaired by former vice chairman Khursh­idul Hassan Advocate to discuss various issues related to the enforcement of fundamental rights for the people and the independence of the judiciary.
The meeting addressed the pending adjudication of other constitutional petitions filed by the people of Gilgit-Bal­t­istan before the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 184(3) for the enforcement of their fundamental rights.
The members unanimously requested CJP Isa to expedite the hearing on the implementation petition and other pending cases, including appointm­e­nts in the GB Supreme Appellate Court.
On January 17, 2019, a seven-judge bench, led by then Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, issued a judgement on petitions challenging the Gilgit-Baltistan Order, 2018, and the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order, 2009.

4,UK police launch probe into murder of British Pakistani man,Sources say the deceased Khalid Mahmood was a 45-year-old man who hailed from Sargodha and owned a mobile phone shop in the area.,"LONDON: A murder investigation was launched by police here after the body of a 45-year-old man was found in a car parked in the parking lot of a popular shopping centre in East London.
A statement released by Metropolitan Police confirmed one arrest linked to the murder. The statement said police were contacted by a neighbouring force on the afternoon of Tuesday, Jan 9, following a report they had received from a member of the public.
“At 01:17hrs on Wednesday, 10 January police traced a car to the Stratford Centre car park in Newham. A man’s body was found in the car.
“Police are working to confirm the man’s identity and inform next of kin. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course.”
Sources said the deceased Khalid Mahmood was a 45-year-old British Pakistani man who hailed from Sargodha and owned a mobile phone shop in the area. A man was arrested in the early hours of Jan 10 at a residential address in Hamp­shire on suspicion of murder. His identity and that of the deceased were not made public by police.
Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, responsible for policing in Newham, said: “I know many local people use the Stratford Centre every day and this awful incident will of course cause considerable concern to shoppers and retailers.
“I would like to reassure people that a man is in custody and, while my colleagues in Specialist Crime investigate, we do not believe there to be any danger to other people. If you have information that you think could help us, I urge you to contact police immediately.”

5,IT industry integral part of knowledge economy: PM Kakar,Caretaker premier reveals Pakistan offering IT services to 190 countries; E-Rozgar centres launched.,"ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Thursday disclosed that Pakistan is providing IT (information technology) services to over 190 countries.
“We are exporting IT and IT-enabled services to more than 190 countries. Our IT industry is an integral part of the knowledge economy thereby earning repute as a leading offshore outsourcing destination through innovation, availability of talent, government incentives and other initiatives for the IT sector,” the premier said while addressing a Tech Destination Pakistan event which featured the launch of E-Rozgar Centers in the country.
“With over 90 per cent tele density, Pakistan was recently ranked as the second most financially attractive destination in the world for offshore outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled Services. Pakistan was also ranked as the third most popular country for freelancing,” he added.
 






“We believe that development of IT sector will bring huge benefits to the nation. It will help in creating more employment opportunities, increase revenues, lift service sector exports and boost foreign reserves,” he added.

Caretaker PM reveals Pakistan offering IT services to 190 countries; E-Rozgar centres launched

Mr Kakar said Pakistan with its talented and skilled human resource base, digital infrastructure, entrepreneurial spirit, and vision to digital transformation was all set to become a knowledge-based economy.
He told the gathering of diplomats, civil and military officers, industry leaders, freelancers and entrepreneurs that the Pakistan Software Export Board had increased the number of software technology parks (STPs) from eight across Pakistan to 30 now. “We are in the process of establishing another 40 software technology parks in the smaller cities across Pakistan.”
The caretaker PM said the government had envisioned bringing economic prosperity and citizen empowerment through digital transformation as it was working on the vision of “Digital Pakistan” through multiple cross-sectoral digital transformation initiatives.
The PM said the government was taking every step possible to facilitate the IT sector by creating an enabling environment and an ecosystem through a broad range of legislative, policy, regulatory and operational initiatives with a focus on inclusion to help reap full benefits of digitalisation.
Pakistan has experienced significant growth in the information and communication technology sector in recent years, he stated, adding, “The country’s ICT industry has become an important contributor to economy, generating revenue, attracting FDI and creating jobs”.
 
 

PM Kakar pointed out that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and its various committees had already started to perform their role in an active manner. Among other priority sectors, bringing the IT sector under the umbrella of SIFC demonstrates the commitment of the government to further promote the ICT industry.
Highlighting the milestones achieved by the government, he mentioned 50 per cent foreign exchange retention, up-skilling and re-skilling of 100,000 individuals, centralised test for IT students, establishment of 10,000 Pakistan e-Rozgar Centers, Pakistan Startup Fund, approval of Digital Economy Enhance­ment Project, approval of Telecom Infrastructure Sharing Framework, Establishment of Telecom Appellate Tribunal, and National Space Policy.
“The establishment of e-Rozgar/Co-working centers across Pakistan, supported by interest-free loans and assistance in training costs, aims to enhance partner capacities. This initiative aims to create an ecosystem where talented individuals can thrive,” he remarked.
In his address, caretaker Minister for IT and Telecommunication Dr Umar Saif said the event was the continuation of the journey started six months ago under the Tech Destination initiative.
He said the government, under the SIFC, had taken some radical steps to facilitate the IT firms which helped increase IT revenue by 13 per cent during last month. He said 65 E-Rozgar centers were already working in Punjab which had so far trained 80,000 people.

6,"PTI, PPP and JI requisition Senate session for timely elections","“Glad that, apart from PTI, other political parties, including PPP and JI, have also joined for this democratic purpose,” says Senator Ali Zafar.","ISLAMABAD: Days after the abrupt prorogation of the Senate following the passage of a resolution by a quorum-less house seeking to postpone general elections, senators belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) have requisitioned a session to discuss the timely conduct of free and fair polls.
PTI Senator Syed Ali Zafar submitted the requisition notice on Thursday, signed by lawmakers from the three political parties, advocating for holding general elections on February 8.
 
 

“Glad that, apart from PTI, other political parties, including PPP and JI, have also joined for this democratic purpose,” he said in a statement. “Elections on time are the right of my fellow Pakistanis,” he added.
JI Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan took to X, formerly Twitter, to state that the agenda of the requisitioned session inclu­des ensuring the conduct of free, fair, and impartial elections on the given date of February 8, following the decision of the Supreme Court and the election schedule ann­ounced by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
 






The agenda also contained suggestions to foil any efforts to make the elections controversial, he added.
Last week, the Senate passed a controversial resolution seeking the postponement of the February 8 elections over security and bad weather concerns. The resolution, moved by independent Senator Dilawar Khan and supported by Balochistan Awami Party senators, drew criticism from different segments of society.

8,"Gas disruption hits Sibi, Bolan and Quetta","“The SSGC team will determine the reason be­­hind the rupture of the pipeline,” SSGC officials say.","QUETTA: Gas supply was disrupted in some parts of Sibi and Bolan districts late on Wednesday night due to a ruptured main gas pipeline, which also supplies gas to the provincial capital, Quetta.
Officials in Bolan district confirmed the rupture of the pipeline passing through Bolan River, releasing huge quantities of gas in the area. The authorities have cut off gas supply in the affected pipeline, informing the locals about the gas leakage.
The provincial capital and its surrounding areas, already facing low gas pressure, are expected to be affected, and gas supply could be suspended anytime in the next 24 hours.
Officials from the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), responsible for supplying gas to Balo­chistan, also confirmed saying, “Gas supply to Quetta will be affected”. They said that engineers have been dispatched to replace the affected portion of the pipeline. 
“The SSGC team will determine the reason be­­hind the rupture of the pipeline,” SSGC officials said. 
Due to a shortage of gas from different fields, the SSGC announced a suspension of gas supply to industries and power generation units in Sindh and Balochistan for two days, from Friday to Sunday. 
In a statement on Thursday, SSGC said that the supply shortfall of around 65 MMSCFD from various gas fields last night has resulted in low gas pressures across Sindh and Balochistan. “At the same time, we are still facing a short supply of around 20 MMSCFD.”
To effectively manage gas load, all industries, including their power generation units, will remain closed for 48 hours, starting from 8am on Friday, January 12 until 8am on Sunday January 14.
Protests in Rakhshan

9,Local PTI leader gunned down in Swabi,JUI-Nazaryati candidate Qari Meharullah survives assassination attempt in Quetta.,"SWABI: A local PTI leader and a prominent businessman was gunned down in the main bazaar on Thursday, police have confirmed.
Shah Khalid was leaving the Swabi District Headquarters Hospital when two unidentified motorcyclists opened fire on the car he was travelling on the Swabi-Jehangira road.
The PTI leader was killed on the spot, and his dead body was taken to the DHQ hospital for autopsy.
 
 

The deceased was considered to be among the leading PTI leaders, especially in the Chota Lahor tehsil of Swabi.
He was also a prominent name in the mining business. He had contested the election for PTI district president but could not succeed.

JUI-N candidate survives assassination attempt in Quetta

While the family has not yet commented on the cause of the killing, insiders said the attack was a result of a “dispute over mines”.
PTI district president Sohail Yousafzai has demanded the prompt arrest of Mr Khalid’s killers.
He said it was the state’s responsibility to provide security to the people.
He added that PTI has been deprived of a key leader at a crucial time just before the general elections.
JUI-N candidate attacked
Separately, a JUI-Nazaryati leader survived an assassination attempt outside his house in Quetta on Thursday.
Qari Meharullah, who is also the party’s candidate for the Balochistan Assembly seat from PB-45 (Quetta), said he was leaving his house for Fajr prayers when unknown armed men opened fire.
“As they started firing, I rushed back inside,” the JUI-N leader said, adding that many bullets hit the main gate and wall of his residence. He confirmed that he remained unhurt in the attack.
The party has lodged a report with the police, and an investigation has been launched.
JUI-N Emir Maulana Abdul Qadir Luni has strongly condemned the attack on Mr Mehar­ullah’s life and said despite his party’s apprehensions over such attacks, the caretaker government has not provided any security to its candidates in Quetta and other areas.
Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Mr Luni added that the party had informed the Balochistan police chief and other authorities about security concerts, “but no security has been provided to leaders”.
He gave a 15-day ultimatum for the attackers’ arrest and warned that in case of failure, JUI-N would launch protests across the province.
Later, the party workers also staged a protest in front of the Press Club and chanted slogans against the government.
