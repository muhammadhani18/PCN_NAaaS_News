1,World watches as Israel faces genocide case,"Quoting Israeli ministers, Pretoria argues intent to destroy Gaza Strip nurtured at ""highest levels"" of govt in Tel Aviv.","

• Quoting Israeli ministers, Pretoria argues intent to destroy Gaza Strip nurtured at ‘highest levels’ of govt in Tel Aviv
• Israel plays victim card, claims it is fighting ‘terrorists’
THE HAGUE: South Africa accused Israel on Thursday of carrying out genocide in Gaza and demanded that the UN’s top court order an emergency suspension of Israel’s devastating military campaign in the Palestinian enclave.
On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, South Africa said Israel’s attack on Gaza, which has demolished much of the coastal enclave and killed more than 23,000 people, aimed to bring about “the destruction of the (territory’s) population”.
“The intent to destroy Gaza has been nurtured at the highest level of state,” Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, advocate of the High Court of South Africa, told the court. He said Israel’s political and military leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were among “the genocidal inciters”.
 
 

“That is evident from the way in which this military attack is being conducted,” he said.
Israel rejected the accusations of genocide as false and baseless and said South Africa was speaking on behalf of Hamas — which Pretoria said was untrue. Netanyahu said the court had been presented with “hypocrisy and lies”.
“Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide,” he said in a statement.
 






“Israel is fighting murderous terrorists who carried out crimes against humanity: they slaughtered, they raped, they burned, they dismembered, they beheaded — children, women, elderly, young men and women,” he said.
Laying out its allegations of genocidal acts, South Africa pointed to Israel’s sustained bombing campaign and to comments by Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who said days after the Oct 7 Hamas raid that Israel would impose a total blockade as part of a battle against “human animals”.
“The evidence of genocidal intent is not only chilling, it is also overwhelming and incontrovertible,” Ngcukaitobi said.
The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted in the wake of the Holocaust, defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.
Emergency ruling
Since Israeli forces launched their attack, nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, one of the world’s most densely populated places, have been driven from their homes at least once, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
“Every day, there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity, and humanity for the Palestinian people,” said Adila Hassim, advocate of South Africa’s high court.
 






Post-apartheid South Africa has long defended the Palestinian cause, a relationship forged when the African National Congress’s struggle against white-minority rule was cheered on by Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation.
South Africa concluded its arguments by requesting emergency measures to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. The ICJ’s decisions are final and without appeal, but it has no way to enforce them.
In its court filings, South Africa cited Israel’s failure to provide food, water, medicine and other essential assistance to Gaza.
In Gaza, Amer Salah, 23, who is sheltering in a UN school in the south after fleeing his home, said he hoped the trial would help pile pressure on Israel.
“We call upon the world to say enough to Israeli killings, enough to massacres, enough to the destruction of Gaza, enough to the bloodshed,” he said. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said the group was following the court proceedings with great interest.

2,PTI ‘unable’ to finalise tickets despite Gohar’s proclamation,A senior party official says PTI was finding it difficult to finalise the candidates “due to different reasons”.,"ISLAMABAD: Despite an announcement by the party chairman, PTI could not finalise the list of candidates for the upcoming general elections till late night on Thursday.
While talking to the media outside the Adiala Jail in the afternoon, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the announcement would be made by 11pm.
“Consultation [with Imran] regarding tickets has been completed. Insha Allah, before 9pm or 11pm in the evening, I will announce the tickets,” Mr Gohar had said.
 






He added that the process to issue tickets will also be initiated, and all PTI candidates will submit their tickets to the respective returning officers by Friday or Saturday.
A clip of his announcement was also shared on the party’s official X account. However, a list of candidates could not be shared with the media till the filing of this story.
 
 

A senior PTI official said the party was finding it difficult to finalise the candidates “due to different reasons”.
“On Thursday, party chairman Barrister Gohar Khan tried to finalise the names in a meeting with the founding chairman Imran Khan in jail, but he was not allowed to take the documents in the jail,” said the PTI leader while requesting anonymity.
He added that a meeting was later held with the incarcerated leader, but the names of candidates were discussed verbally.
“After returning from jail, the PTI chairman had to recall names discussed with Mr Khan,” the party leader said while explaining the reasons for the delay in the announcement.
Another reason cited by the party official was the delay in the issuance of PTI’s ‘bat’ symbol by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

3,Drap seizes batch of ‘poisonous’ cough syrup ingredient,"Propylene glycol is used in ""almost all the cough syrups and syrups given for fever and as pain killers"", says Drap CEO.","ISLAMABAD: The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) has seized a batch of imported pharmaceutical ingredients for having high level of impurities, the reaction to which could be fatal, the regulatory body’s CEO has confirmed.
The acceptable level of impurities in Propylene Glycol (PG) excipient — used in cough syrups — is 1.1 per cent, and any contamination above that level can lead to multiple organ failure.
The batch, imported from Thailand’s Dow Chemical, had an impurity level of 25pc.
The batch was tested at Karachi’s Central Drug Laboratory (CDL) after the importer, M/s MKB Pharmaceuticals (Pvt) Ltd, Peshawar, informed Drap about the impurities.
According to a document issued by Drap, when the impurities, also called ethylene glycol (EG), are ingested, they metabolise into toxins that affect the central nervous system and heart and can cause kidney damage, which can be fatal.
Drap Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr Asim Rauf told Dawn that PG is added to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) or raw material to sweeten syrups and is called an excipient instead of API.
“The excipient is used in almost all the cough syrups and syrups given for fever and as pain killers.”
Dr Rauf claimed that the batch of excipients was purchased through a middleman, who is Pakistani.
Drap has reached out to the middleman and sent an e-mail to the Thai company for information about other companies in Pakistan who have been sold the excipient.
“Our team is working to ensure that only safe medicine/syrups reach the patients,” the Drap CEO said, adding that all pharma companies have been directed to get the excipient tested before manufacturing syrups.

4,"6.0 earthquake jolts Punjab, parts of KP",No reports of casualties or financial losses were received from across Punjab.,"

ISLAMABAD: People gather outside a high-rise building in the capital following an earthquake on Thursday. A tremor of 6.4-magnitude hit northeastern Afghanistan, shaking buildings from Kabul to Lahore.—AFP

 
ISLAMABAD: A 6.0-mag­n­itude earthquake shook buildings in different parts of the country on Thursday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Depa­rtment (PMD).
The tremors were caused by a powerful earthquake which hit northeastern Afgha­nistan, shaking buildings from the capital Kabul to Islamabad in Pakistan.
Lahore and its adjacent areas experienced a strong earthquake at around 2:30pm on Thursday, but no reports of casualties or financial losses were received from across Punjab.
The seismic intensity recorded on the Richter scale is 6.0 while the epicentre of the earthquake was in the Hindu Kush region of Pak-Afghan border at a depth of 213km. Its longitude and latitude were 70.63 East and 36.16 North, respectively.

 





 
According to the PMD, the seismic activity was felt in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Muzffe­rabad, Peshawar, Chilas, Quetta, Zhob, Charat and other cities.
According to a spokesman for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Punjab, the strong tremors lasted at least five to six seconds before subsiding. In the capital city, people were seen coming out of high-rise buildings.
The PDMA is actively checking the structural integrity of buildings throughout Punjab and machinery and personnel are on alert for post-quake assessments, the authority’s spokesperson said.
District emergency operation centers, including PDMA’s provincial control room, are on 24/7 alert across Punjab and information on earthquake damages can be reported to helpline 1129, said spokesperson.

5,Islamabad distances itself from Fazl’s Kabul sojourn,"FO spokesperson rubbishes claims in ex-Indian envoy’s book as attempt to advance India’s ""fictitious narratives"".","ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday distanced itself from Jamiat Ulama-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s visit to Afghanistan that focused on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue, a key point of contention in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations.
“He (Fazl) is not visiting Afghanistan as an emissary of the Government of Pakistan and he is there in his individual capacity,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at the weekly media briefing while responding to multiple questions about the trip by the prominent religio-political figure.
 
 

Maulana Fazl had travelled to Kabul on Sunday leading a delegation of Deobandi clerics, some of whom enjoy considerable influence on Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers.
Though this is the second time that FO dissociated itself from the visit, Pakistani chargé d’affaires in Kabul Obaid Nizamani had accompanied him on the journey from Islamabad. He had, moreover, been briefed on Afghan ties at FO before embarking on the visit.
Maulana Fazl received the official invitation for the trip from Taliban administration after he conveyed his desire to visit Afghanistan for discussing issues that had been souring the ties, especially that of TTP.

FO spokesperson rubbishes claims in ex-Indian envoy’s book as attempt to advance India’s ‘fictitious narratives’

During his visit, Maulana Fazl, who undertook the trip in the middle of hectic election campaign, met key Taliban leaders, including the Prime Minister of the interim Afghan government and the supreme leader Haibatullah Akhunzada in Kandahar. It was Maulana Fazl’s first trip to Afghanistan since Taliban’s assumption of control following the US withdrawal in 2021.
 
 

Though Maulana Fazl and his entourage were warmly welcomed in Afghanistan, many Taliban leaders were sceptical about the initiative as they believed that the cleric undertook the visit for personal interests.
Maulana Fazl reportedly assured his Taliban interlocutors that the incoming government, which will take office after Feb 8 polls, will review the issue of negotiations with TTP. He had also sought Afghan Taliban administration’s help for preventing TTP attacks during elections.
On the possibility of resumption of talks with TTP that broke down in late 2022 when the terrorist group ended the ceasefire, the FO spokesperson said: “Our position hasn’t changed. Pakistan is not interested in dialogue with TTP. We have no dialogue taking place, nor do we intend to have a dialogue with TTP.”
“Our demands from the Afghan authorities haven’t changed, they remain the same, which is that the Afghan authorities should take action, effective action against terrorist elements inside Afghanistan, including TTP leadership,” she said.
Indian diplomat’s book
The spokesperson disparaged the former High Commissioner of India to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria’s newly released book, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan, as an attempt to “advance India’s fictitious narratives around the developments of February 2019 and the usual chest thumping that Indian officials have adopted as their default narrative”.
The book covers significant events such as the Pulwama attack, the Balakot airstrike, and the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. The book notably reveals an incident where former PM Imran Khan, fearing an Indian missile attack post-Balakot, tried to initiate a midnight call with Indian PM Narendra Modi to avert further escalation.
“As the next Lok Sabha elections draw closer, it is not surprising that a Pakistan bashing, jingoistic and militaristic narrative is now being unleashed in India,” she further noted.
