0,SC may announce PTI ‘bat’ symbol verdict today,CJP highlights importance of democracy whether in country or political party,"The Supreme Court is expected to make a decision Saturday (today) on the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) plea challenging the reinstatement of the PTI’s electoral symbol, the 'cricket bat'.
While hearing the electoral body’s petition challenging the Peshawar High Court's (PHC) decision to restore PTI's electoral symbol, Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa on Friday remarked that they wanted the next polls to be held in the country.
A three-member bench, comprising the CJP, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali, heard the case.
The PHC annulled the ECP’s ruling that revoked the PTI’s cherished electoral symbol citing irregularities in the party’s internal polls.
The CJP pointed out that the high court in its decision had ordered the provision of the electoral symbol and certificate to the PTI but not issued the declaration of its intra-party elections.
He added that the PHC should first issue a declaration under Article 17 on whether the December 22 internal elections of the PTI were held in accordance with the party’s constitution or not.
The CJP observed that giving electoral symbol and issuing the certificate would be a result of the declaration.
He continued that everything depended on the intra-party elections being declared valid.
CJP Isa highlighted the importance of democracy, whether it was in the country or a political party.
The top judge noted that just as it is a fundamental right to form a political party according to Article 17 of the Constitution, each of its members had the right to contest for its offices.
He warned that if the intra-party elections were held according to the constitution of the party, there would be consequences.
The CJP further remarked that the apex court would not ""take over"" the responsibilities of the ECP.

Justice Isa, responding to the arguments presented by PTI counsel Hamid Khan, observed that a ""very clear line"" of demarcation existed between the functions of a statutory body and of a constitutional body.
""If they [ECP] are doing their job, we won’t take over their job [or tell them] how to do it [or] how to do it better,” the top judge continued.
The CJP also inquired that when the PTI had accepted the jurisdiction of the Lahore High Court on its intra-party elections, then why did it approach the PHC.
He observed that was a contradiction between the order of the single judge of the LHC and the decision of the PHC.
He added that rejecting the petition, the single judge had noted that to cancel the decision of the ECP, the relevant provisions of the Election Act must first be annulled.
However, he highlighted that nobody had challenged the relevant clauses of the Election Act.
As the hearing commenced, the counsel representing the ECP, Makhdoom Ali Khan, came to the rostrum. CJP Isa asked him whether the high court's written order had been issued, to which he replied in the negative.
After reading out the PHC order restoring the PTI’s electoral symbol, he maintained that the ECP had not received any notice from the high court.
The CJP noted that he had not read the case file either.
The counsel further urged the apex court to adjourn the hearing till Monday when asked if he was ready to present the case, adding that the ECP would issue the electoral symbols on Saturday.
CJP Isa, however, said the SC was willing to hear the case on Saturday and Sunday as adjourning the hearing would mean the PHC order would have to be suspended.
The ECP's counsel then sought time till Saturday to prepare for the case.
The court asked the PTI counsel that when the internal polls were assigned to a federal election commissioner, why did the party use the term chief election commissioner. Justice Mazhar asked about the process for appointing the party's chief election commissioner, to which Makhdoom replied that Jamal Ansari was the previous CEC and Niazullah Niazi took over the role later.
“The election commission is not just a quasi-judicial body. It is a constitutional body,"" observed the CJP.
To Justice Isa’s query about other the members of PTI's election commission, the ECP counsel replied that no other member apart from the CEC was appointed.
CJP Isa then asked PTI's counsel Hamid if the information was accurate, to which he said it was not.
The CJP then inquired about documents about the appointment of other members of the PTI's electoral body.
Hamid said he too required time to prepare for the case, adding that he would present his arguments against the ECP's appeal over its lack of maintainability.
The hearing was later adjourned till Saturday (today).

1,IMF board okays $700m loan tranche,Disbursements to Pakistan will hit $1.9b after this amount,"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday approved the first review of the bailout package for Pakistan, paving the way for the release of $700 million loan tranche ahead of the maturity of a $2 billion lending granted by a Gulf nation.
The immediate handing over of around $700 million brings the total disbursements under the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF to $1.9 billion, the finance ministry said in a brief statement issued after the board meeting.
The board meeting was held nearly two months after Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement.
Pakistan and the IMF had signed the nine-month programme in July 2023 for a $3 billion lending as a bridge financing ahead of an expected long-term deal.
The IMF has further cut Pakistan’s economic growth projection to 2% from July’s estimate of 2.5%.
Similarly, the IMF has cut the inflation rate forecast from 26% to nearly 24%, providing space for lowering the interest rates.
With the fresh approval of $700 million, Pakistan’s gross official foreign exchange reserves would reach a six-month high of $8.8 billion.
In recent weeks, the IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) have helped Pakistan in sustaining its foreign reserves at their current levels.
A finance ministry official said a $2 billion loan of the UAE was maturing this month.
He added that $1 billion would mature on the coming Wednesday and another $1 billion on January 23.
He explained that on Tuesday, the finance ministry requested the UAE to further rollover the loan for a period of one year.
The response of the finance ministry spokesperson was awaited whether or not the UAE had accepted Pakistan’s request for the extension of the loan.
The UAE has placed $3 billion with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to support the thin foreign exchange reserves, including $1 billion handed over after the approval of the IMF programme in July 2023.
The $2 billion had been given at an interest rate of 3% but the latest $1 billion was extended at 6.5% -- more than double of the old one, according to the finance ministry official.
The official elaborated that because of the extraordinary situation, Pakistan was not in a position to return the UAE loan and to ensure the sustainability of the ongoing economic reform process, the deposits of the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development remained crucial for the stability of the external account.
Apart from the UAE, Saudi Arabia has deposited $5 billion with the SBP.
China has also granted $4 billion deposits -- $2 billion of it maturing in March, according to finance ministry officials.
Pakistan’s bilateral creditors -- the UAE, China and Saudi Arabia -- have linked the renewals of their loans with the continuation of the engagement with the IMF and the approval of the first programme.
The IMF emphasised on continued fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt, while protecting development needs.
Pakistan remains “determined to achieve a primary surplus of at least 0.4% of GDP in FY24, underpinned by federal and provincial government spending restraint and improved revenue performance support, if necessary, by contingent measures,” a statement by the IMF read.
The country would also be required to “complete the return to a market-determined exchange rate”, it added.
“Pakistan would also pursue state-owned enterprise and governance reforms to attract investment and support job creation, while continuing to strengthen social assistance,” the statement continued.
Read Markets confident about approval of IMF tranche
The IMF has revised Pakistan’s foreign loan requirements to $25 billion for this fiscal year.
The Washington-based lender also lowered its inflation projection to 24% for this fiscal year -- cutting it from 25.9%.
The IMF remained successful in acquiring a date for the next general elections in Pakistan and in return ignored a few critical areas that in the past had become a cause for the failure of the last $6.5 billion bailout package.
It also brought the activities of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) under its purview.
As against the old forecast of $32.9 billion, the IMF has now projected the foreign remittances at $29.4 billion -- a reduction of $3.5 billion, said finance ministry sources.
The exports have been marginally adjusted downwards to $30.6 billion, they added, while imports were projected at $58 billion.
The global lender has projected that the public and publicly guaranteed debt may increase to Rs81.8 trillion or equal to 76.8% of the GDP by the end of this fiscal year.
Due to unrealistic budgetary allocations, the IMF has now projected the size of Pakistan’s federal budget at Rs15.4 trillion -- Rs1.1 trillion higher than the one approved by the National Assembly in June this year.
In comparison with the Rs6.9 trillion budget deficit target, the IMF during the recent review talks has estimated it to peak to a record Rs8.2 trillion -- a slippages of Rs1.3 trillion.
According to the IMF projections, the current expenditures in this fiscal year may remain around Rs14.6 trillion -- higher by Rs1.24 trillion.
However, the development spending is projected at Rs782 billion -- Rs168 billion less than the allocation approved by the National Assembly in June.
As a result, the size of the budget, for the first time, would cross Rs15.4 trillion in the history of the country.
The global lender has kept the overall primary balance figure unchanged at 0.4% of the GDP or Rs401 billion -- which would require massive revenue efforts and a squeeze on subsidies.
Pakistan has committed with the IMF to further increase the petroleum levy collection to a record Rs918 billion in this fiscal year.
The government assured the IMF to further increase the petroleum levy annual target of Rs869 billion by another Rs50 billion.
The higher levy collection is being assured to compensate for the loss of revenue from other non-tax revenue sources.
The government charges Rs60 petroleum tax on every litre of petrol and diesel.
The Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) tax collection target remained unchanged at Rs9.415 trillion after the review talks. However, within the overall target of Rs9.415 trillion, the income tax collection target has been further increased by Rs346 billion -- aimed at compensating for the shortfall against the other three taxes.
The income tax collection’s revised target is Rs4.23 trillion, which is equal to 45% of the total collection.
The sales tax annual target has been slashed by Rs196 billion, custom duties by Rs117 billion and federal excise duty collection target by Rs34 billion.

2,Another Senate resolution seeks brakes on ballots,"Upper house urges govt to provide all parties with level playing field, address security concerns","As the political arena braces for the upcoming general elections, a new resolution advocating a pause in the electoral process landed in the Senate on Friday. Senator Hidayatullah, representing the Independent Parliamentary Group, submitted the resolution in the Senate Secretariat, proposing a three-month postponement of the polls.
The resolution voices apprehension about the persistent escalation in the targeting of election candidates, emphasizing the constitutional duty to conduct general elections nationwide. It underscores deep concern over recent incidents of terrorism and violence across the country, citing armed attacks in North Waziristan, Bajaur, Swabi, and Turbat.
These incidents have created an atmosphere of fear and insecurity across the country, with candidates receiving threatening pamphlets at their residences and campaign offices, which has emerged as a disturbing dimension to the current security challenges, the resolution said.
According to the text, the resolution added that the Upper House recognises that holding the general elections is a constitutional obligation, and the Constitution equally emphasises free and fair elections and ensuring the safety and unhindered participation of all stakeholders.
The resolution further stated that where the Constitution emphasises ensuring the conduct of free elections, it ensures the fundamental right of the people to the security of life and property.
Senator Hidayatullah said that Article (9) of the Constitution highlights the importance of this fundamental right, which the state has to provide in all circumstances and added that the protection of life and property of the people is the state's primary responsibility.
Hence, the Upper House urges the Election Commission of Pakistan and the Supreme Court of Pakistan to postpone the elections, he added.
During the adjournment period, the upper house calls on the government to proactively create conditions that ensure a level playing field for all political parties and candidates, while addressing security concerns, the resolution further stated.
On January 5, a sparsely attended session in the upper house of parliament stirred discussions when it unexpectedly endorsed a resolution, albeit non-binding, urging the postponement of general elections due to concerns about security and adverse weather conditions.
The resolution, introduced by independent Senator Dilawar Khan and primarily supported by Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) senators, drew criticism for its unanticipated discussion and apparent backing from certain other parties. The absence of lawmakers from mainstream political parties raised suspicions.
During the voice vote, PPP Senator Bahramand Tangi not only remained silent but also delivered a speech emphasising the importance of peace before elections. Later, his party issued a show-cause notice for deviating from its policy.
The passage of the resolution faced condemnation from politicians and lawyers who labelled it a ""conspiracy against democracy"" and insisted on holding timely elections. In response, another resolution was presented in the Senate by Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan, emphasising adherence to ""constitutional requirements"" for the timely conduct of polls.
Furthermore, senators from PTI, PPP, and Jamaat-e-Islami requisitioned a session to discuss the timely conduct of free and fair elections on Thursday. PTI Senator Syed Ali Zafar submitted the requisition notice, signed by lawmakers from the three political parties, advocating for holding general elections on February 8.
