1,UK body helps police set up school for abandoned trans kids,Six to 18 years old children to be admitted to institute having six classrooms,"LAHORE: The Punjab police in collaboration with a British organisation has laid foundation of the first-ever primary English-medium school and vocational training institute in Lahore for the ‘abandoned transgender kids’ with a prime objective of eliminating the decades-old ‘guru culture’ prevailing in the transgender community.
Both sides have planned O and A level education and training to help support the transgender children following reports that approximately 80 per cent of them were abandoned by their parents to avoid criticism by relatives and the society, and they were later left to be adopted by the ‘gurus.’  
The police experts believed that the trans children used to become vulnerable to begging, drug and sexual crime when they fell prey to the ‘guru system.’  
The Punjab police planned establishment of first such education and training facility named ‘Tahafuz Darsgah’, in collaboration with the UK Curriculum and Accreditation Body (UKCAB) at Jallo in Lahore cantonment area over a four-kanal land.
Punjab IG Dr Usman Anwar laid the foundation stone of the building here on Thursday, setting the Feb 5 deadline for making it functional.  

Six to 18 years old children to be admitted to institute having six classrooms

The IG and chairman of the UKCAB also signed a memorandum of understanding.
From the UK-based organisation, Zahid Bhatti, Nabil Amir, Abdullah Mushtaq and Asad Ali Malik attended the event while Punjab Safe City Managing Director Ahsan Yunus, Lahore Operations DIG Ali Nasir Rizvi, Chief Traffic Officer Ammara Athar and Gulberg ASP Sheharbano represented the police.
According to the agreement, the UK organisation will bear all the expenses for the education and training of the transgender children where they will be imparted O and A level education.  
“Keeping in view the hardships they have to face, the Punjab police have approved establishment of the first primary level school and vocational training centre near Jallo”, Gulberg ASP Sheharbano told Dawn.
As per the plan, she said, the Punjab police would enroll the transgender children from the age of six to 18.
They would get quality education and training at the school which would house initially six classrooms, the ASP said.
She said the Punjab police would prefer qualified transgender women to be hired as female teachers.  
Another important development is that the transgender school children would have ‘mothers’ to be looked after on the pattern of the system adopted by the SOS Children’s Village (schools).
As per the master plan, the Punjab police will take primary education to the university level in the next phase where the transgender students would get higher education too to become an integral part of the society.
To a question, the ASP said the Punjab police would take help from its website to get access to the trans children and encourage the parents to enroll them for education in the school.
Similarly, the police would also take help from the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau from where the trans children would be given the opportunity to get education in the school.

Lahore Bar Association members marched from Aiwan-i-Adl to the LHC chanting slogans against Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti. They also locked the courts at the judicial complex. The leadership and the members of the LHCBA also joined the rally.
The bar leaders said the unilateral decision of the high court to shift civil courts from Aiwan-i-Adl to Model Town courts was a ‘conspiracy’ to divide the lawyers.

3,Plan sought on promoting HG1 garlic variety,"LAHORE: The Senate Standing Committee on Commerce has sought a plan from the commerce ministry, provincial...","LAHORE: The Senate Standing Committee on Commerce has sought a plan from the commerce ministry, provincial governments and the National Agriculture Research Centre to support HG1 variety of garlic to put an end to imports of the spices worth Rs80 billion per annum.
The plan includes policy, investment, training and other measures required from the Export Development Fund (EDF) to increase production of NARC HG1 Garlic variety that has the potential to not only make the country self-sufficient in the kitchen item and also produce export surplus, said Pakistan Horticulture Development & Export Company (PHDEC) Punjab Region’s head Jafar Ali here on Thursday.
Speaking at a seminar on the garlic variety, he said that his organisation was ready to extend all possible help needed to promote the garlic variety under its mandate of promoting export of horticulture products and would do its best on its part to support HG1 as per direction of the Senate panel.
He said the growers and the companies involved in the production of the variety could finance their business plans by the EDF.
Mr Ali said that the PHDEC, after establishing its presence at all provincial headquarters, was also going to open its offices in hubs of different horticulture produce, such as Umer Kot known for chili production, Multan for mango, etc. to save the growers from the hassle of traveling to far off offices for seeking solution to their issues.
Tariq Ismail Mayo, Agro Bridge (Pvt) Limited CEO, said at present 577 farmers were sowing HG1 at around 2,200 acres of land and if the acreage was pushed up to 25,000 acres, it could help end the country’s dependence on garlic import.
“At present we are meeting around 60 percent of our domestic needs from garlic imports from neighbouring countries formally or informally.”
He said that research work in collaboration with three universities was onto cut down HG1 cost of production and make it more profitable for the growers, while efforts were also on to make it “zero waste” crop as all parts of its plant were usable in one industry or the other.
It could also curb smog caused by rice stubble burning because the rice waste was beneficial for the garlic crop in many ways, including mulching, maintaining moisture in the soil and working as compost for better growth of garlic bulbs, he claimed.
Garlic Growers Association president Muhammad Luqman said that total per annum consumption of garlic in Pakistan was around 300,000 tonnes and a major chunk of it was imported. He stressed for keeping the garlic crop more organic to make it acceptable in the international markets and focusing on value addition to ensure its export to the states where its raw form is not accepted.
Sharing his experience, Ali Raza Kharal, a progressive farmer from Sheikhupura, said that at least 100,000 plants per acre should be sown to get 60mm of fruit, which was acceptable for domestic use.
Hussnain Akhtar Virk, another grower, called for educating farmers about the link between climatic and soil conditions with a crop to make agriculture a more profitable sector for the younger generation.

5,PML-N ignores old guards as it  announces tickets for Gujrat,District president quits party to join PML-Q; former mayor also offended.,"GUJRAT: The PML N has ignored its two major old guards in the Gujrat district in nominating the party candidates for the upcoming election.  
Former minister for state Chaudhry Jaafar Iqbal Fatta Bhand and former mayor of Gujrat Municipal Corporation Haji Nasir Mehmood have not been given the party tickets for NA-65 (Lalamusa-Dinga) and PP-31 (Gujrat city), respectively.  
The PML-N has announced a party ticket for Naseer Abbas Sidh, the brother of Chief of Air Staff Zaheerudin Baber Sidhu, for NA-65 against PPP stalwart Qamar Zaman Kaira and former MNA Syed Faizul Hassan Shah of Kulewal Syedan. However, Sidh was given the ticket at the cost of Jaafar Iqbal Fatta Bhand who had won the seat for the party in 2013 and remained the runner-up in 2018 against the PTI’s Faizul Hassan Shah who is now again in the run as an independent  candidate after quitting the PTI.  
Jaafar Iqbal was a party candidate since 2002 when the PML-N was facing the wrath of Gen Musharraf and again in 2008 as well while Naseer Abbas Sidh was a PML-Q candidate in both these elections.   

District president quits party to join PML-Q; former mayor also offended  

Similarly, Ex-MPA and former mayor of Gujrat MC Haji Nasir Mehmood has been made a scapegoat to accommodate Shafay Hussain, the son of PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, in PP-31 Gujrat city as the PML N did not nominate any candidate against both sons of Shujaat.  
Former federal minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain will contest from two seats, NA 64 (Gujrat city-Kunjah) and PP-32 (Kunjah), as the PML-Q nominee.   
The local PML-N cadres have strongly condemned the party decision of not awarding tickets to the former mayor. However, Haji Nasir said he had convened a meeting of local party officials on Friday (today) for consultation on the future course of action, adding that he had neither been taken into confidence on the matter by the party nor had he been asked to support the PML-Q candidates.   
On the other hand, Shafay Hussain has consistently been criticising the former mayor in his speeches and statements.  
Both the PML-Q and PML-N have agreed on the seat adjustment only in NA-64 and its both PA seats, PP-31 and PP-32, as the nominees of both the parties are up against each other on at least six seats, including NA-62 and NA-63 and PP 27, 28, 29 and 30 whereas the PML-Q did not field any candidates in NA-65 and its both PA seats, PP-33 and PP-34.   
Meanwhile, the PML-N has issued tickets to at least three brothers from the Kotla group as former MNA Abid Raza, his elder brother Tanveer Kotla, a former Gujrat district council chairman, and former MPA Shabbir Kotla have been nominated for NA-62, PP-33 and PP-28, respectively.   
Similarly, two members of the Nawabzada family, including former MNA Nawabzada Ghazanfar Ali Gul and former MPA Nawabzada Haider Mehdi, have been given the PML-N tickets for NA-63 and PP-29, respectively.  
On the other hand, on being ignored by his own party in the award of tickets, PML-N district general secretary Raja Muhammad Aslam announced joining the PML-Q. 
Aslam was PML-N candidate for PP-27 (Sara-i-Alamgir-Kharian) in the 2018 election while the party has awarded a ticket to former MNA Malik Haneef Awan for the constituency.  
Raja Aslam announced joining the PML-Q at a news conference in the presence of PML-Q leader Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain who declared him as the party candidate for PP-27. 
Former MNA Tashfeen Safdar Marala and Naeem Raza Kotla, PML-Q nominee for PP-28 (Kotla) were also present.  
Earlier on Wednesday, Kharian’s Marala group of former PML-Q MNA Rehman Naseer Marala had joined the PML-N in a meeting with Shehbaz Sharif in Lahore. However, the PML N suffered a loss when its district general secretary quit it to join the PML-Q.  
The political realignment has been accelerated in Gujrat district as the electioneering picked up the momentum and the parties have started awarding tickets to their candidates.

6,"— finalises tickets for Sahiwal, Pakpattan","SAHIWAL: Although the PML-N has finalised its candidates for two NA and five PA seats in Sahiwal, still NA-143,...","SAHIWAL: Although the PML-N has finalised its candidates for two NA and five PA seats in Sahiwal, still NA-143, PP-203, and PP-204 candidates have yet to be decided. 
Sources say the PML-N has agreed to award a ticket to Nauman Langriyal under seat adjustment with the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) for NA-143, but this has yet to be announced officially. Reports suggest Mr Langriyal wants tickets for his men for two provincial assembly constituencies under his area. 
For this, the PML-N will have to ignore both Chaudhary Zahid and Tufail Jutt and Hanif Jutt of Chichawatni, who have won these seats on PML-N tickets in the previous election. Mr Zahid also remained district nazin in the 2012 tenure. 
In Sahiwal tehsil, the PML-N has repeated its thrice and twice winner candidates - Pir Imran Shah, Chaudhry Ashraf, Pir Walayat Shah Khagga, and Malik Arshad for NA-141, NA-142, PP-198, and PP-200. 
Malik Nadeem Kamran, who became MPA in the 2008, 2013, and 2018 elections, has been given party ticket for his son Qasim Nadeem for PP-199 because of his health problems. In the same manner, the party awarded the ticket to Naveed Aslem Lodhi for PP-201, who is the son-in-law of Arshad Khan Lodhi from Harrpa.  Ayesha Lodhi, the daughter of Arshad Lodhi, was denied ticket for NA-142. 
The PML-N denied the ticket to Nouraz Shakoor, who sought the ticket under seat adjustment from IPP for NA-141. Pir Imran, a thrice winner, retained his ticket for the fourth time. 
Also, nomination papers of Rai Hasan Nawaz, Rai Murtaza Iqbal, Rai Muhammad Iqbal, and Major Sarwar have been accepted by the election appellant tribunal, and they are all PTI candidates in Chichawatni. The Rais will contest for NA-142, NA-143, and PP-201 and PP-202. 
In Pakpattan, Ahmed Raza Manika, Sardar Mansib Ali Dogar, Rana Iradat Ali Doger, Kashif Ali Chishti, and Dr Farukkh Javed have been given PML-N tickets for NA-139, PP-197, NA-140, PP-195, and PP-196, respectively.
Ahmed Raza Manika has not been finalized for PP-197 and PP-198 because Hayat Manika, the son-in-law of Bushra Bibi, had also applied for PML-N ticket. 
Last week, Ata Manika, senior Parliamentarian and father of Hayat Manik, met with PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif and demanded a PML-N ticket either for himself or his son. Both have applied as candidates, and their nomination papers have been accepted. 
Chaudhry Naeem Ibrahim, a PTI candidate, has had his nomination paper accepted from PP-196. Interestingly, he is behind bars under corruption cases filed by ACE, Sahiwal region.

He made the announcement after consulting his political supporters. His close circles alleged that Mian Nawaz Sharif was angry with him as he had not voted in favour of former army chief General Bajwa when a bill was move for his extension.
As per announcement of party tickets by the  PML-N, there  was no sign of seat adjustment with the IPP and JUI and almost  all  former MNAs and MPAs were granted party tickets except for NA-84   (Sargodha city and suburbs) where former MNA Chaudhry Hamid Hameed   reported to be close to Mian Shahbaz Sharif was replaced by sitting  ex-MPA Dr  Liaqat Ali Khan.
MPL-N did not issue ticket to Maryam Nawaz from PP-80 (Sargodha) and gave it to Asim Sher Mekan.
Former   MPA and tehsil nazim Dr. Liaqat Ali Khan has been issued a ticket in   place of former MNA Chaudhry Hamid Hameed from NA-84 Sargodha city,  who  was elected from this constituency twice on the PML-N ticket,  although  he lost it in the 2008 general election from this constituency  when  PPP nominee Tasneem Qureshi was declared successful.

Chairing a meeting to review the e-registry and land record digitisation project PULSE, at the civil secretariat on Thursday, chief secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman said the development authorities of Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, and Gujranwala must be integrated with the PULSE project for digitisation of records.  
He directed the deputy commissioners of Narowal, Layya, Okara and Pakpattan for expediting work on the PULSE [Punjab Urban Land Systems Enhancement] project in their respective districts.

9,Punjab health dept for raising upper age limit for girls’ marriage,NCSW highlights urgency in building national consensus to eradicate child marriage across Pakistan.,"LAHORE: The primary and secondary healthcare department has come up with a proposal to enhance the upper age limit of girl child for marriage following reports that the hormonal changes during adolescence are leading to physiological disorders.
Punjab Primary and Secondary Healthcare Minister Dr Jamal Nasir said this while speaking at a consultative session held under the auspices of the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) here on Thursday.
He said forcing minor girls or those who were not physically or emotionally mature could lead to multiple problems in these young brides.
“Furthermore, medical evidence supports the fact that women are genetically and naturally more vulnerable, necessitating the protection of their fundamental rights”, the minister said.
He said subjecting them to married life at a tender age could cause a drastic deterioration in their physical health.
“Our society grapples with a dilemma when dealing with infertility; typically, the burden of costly and painful testing falls solely on the wife, while the husband may neglect such examinations”, Dr Jamal said. This societal behaviour contributes to both physical and mental health issues, he added.
NCSW Chairperson Nilofar Bakhtiar expressed the commission’s awareness of the gravity of the social issue, which deprives girls of their fundamental rights to choose, health, and education.
Recognising the profound impact of child marriage, she said, the NCSW has consistently engaged its mandate to review related legislation, identifying the need for amendments and effective implementation approaches.
For those already married at a young age, the commission advocates providing access to education, healthcare, psychosocial support, and the development of rehabilitation and reintegration programmes to help child brides rebuild their lives and pursue their aspirations.
“Let’s unite to end child marriage. Every child deserves a childhood filled with education, play, and dreams, not forced into marriage. Together, we can break the chains that deny them their rights and build a future where every child can flourish,” Bakhtiar urged.

The NCSW highlights urgency in building national consensus to eradicate child marriage across Pakistan.

About the event, the speakers said in collaboration with its esteemed development partners, namely UNFPA, UNICEF, and UN Women, the commission convened the critical consultation with provincial stakeholders in Lahore on the status of women. The objective was to chart an effective course of action following impactful discussions on ending child marriage in the country.
Provincial stakeholders participating in the event included the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women, social welfare department, the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, Punjab Human Rights and Minorities Affairs Department, health department, and Punjab Local Government and Community Development Department.
The attendees comprised representatives from government departments, civil society organisations, NGOs, mental and physical health experts, students, and journalists.
