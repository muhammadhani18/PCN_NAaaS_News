0,"When women take the bus, and drive it too",First batch of 18 female drivers to graduate next week.,"KARACHI: Besides driving one crazy with their wit and humour, they can drive almost anything … motorbikes, cars, buses including diesel hybrid, electric hybrid or fully electric. There are one-and-a-half dozen of them for now, undergoing training with the Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA). Dawn had the good fortune of meeting with them at the Mehran Bus Depot in Malir on Thursday, just two classes before their much-awaited graduation on Jan 15.
Having started their training on Nov 1, 2023 they were all happy to be passing the first milestone. Most, with a few exceptions of course, will not be seen driving buses immediately.
According to the operations manager of the Peoples Bus Service, Abdul Shakoor, there is a time period of around three years needed for lots of practice.
“They have the learner’s licence, to be followed by the Light Transport Vehicle (LTV) licence, the Heavy Transport Vehicle (HTV) licence and the Public Service Vehicle (PSV) licence that these drivers must acquire before driving the buses, which would take them approximately three years,” he said.

First batch of 18 female drivers to graduate next week

“These licences are given to the drivers after their passing the tests from the vehicle licence branch of the traffic police. You must understand that a bus driver is the custodian of so many lives. There will be no compromise or taking of risks when so many innocent lives of passengers are involved,” he pointed out.
Luckily, as mentioned earlier, this wouldn’t be the case for all as there are some very experienced drivers in the first batch also. According to Huma Ashar, who has led this programme as Gender Specialist at SMTA: “Although the requirement for a HTV licence is three years, involving other licences, there are some trainees who already have a LTV license.”
They would be Uzma Bibi and Amber Azeem.
Uzma shared that she had before this learned how to ride a motorbike and car and had also worked as a car driving instructor.
Asked what was different in driving these buses and ordinary driving, she said that driving a bus changes everything. “Even the steering wheel is so big. Then all these buses are automatic. You may think that would make driving them easier but it is not the case,” she said.
Amber Azeem, another experienced driver, who used to run a pick and drop van service for office going women, added to this by explaining that when carrying so much load in a long bus there are so many things to be taken into consideration. “There is the speed of the bus to be thought about. Because it has an impact on your passengers when you hit the brakes. The turning radius of such a long vehicle also needs expertise,” she said.
While agreeing with them, Ms Ashar said that they only need another two to three months of advance training for them to get used to such things before being put on the buses. Having watched their progress from the start when they arrived for basic training with the National Highways and Motorway Police at Maymar, she has confidence in their abilities.
“Our advertisements for women bus drivers got us an initial response from some 25 women. We facilitated them by paying them a stipend, we also paid them transport allowance besides providing them lunch during their daily classes at Maymar but still some seven of them could not go through the strenuous training for those first 45 days and dropped out. Those who completed that training were then brought to the Mehran Depot to be put on the buses from Dec 15,” she said.
“Mind you, this is only the first batch. For our next batches, these women will be the inspiration, the trailblazers. We also hope to induct transgenders for this job,” she said.
Meanwhile, in one of their final classes at Mehran Bus Depot, the women drivers, most possessing learners’ licences for now, were found revising all the bus routes around Karachi with their instructors Afaq Ahmed and Qaiser Shah before their practical, which meant they all had to take turns behind the wheel of the buses.
Knowing well about the long road lying ahead for most of them, the women drivers, who belonged to various ages, were all in high spirits as they joked with each other.
Faiza Abdul Sattar looked like the youngest among them but it turned out that she was not. “She only looks young,” pointed out Kiran Iftikhar.
Hearing this Faiza said: “Yes, I’m Kiran’s mother-in-law.”
“But if my mother-in-law looks so young then I am not born yet!” Quipped Kiran as everyone burst out laughing.
It turned out that Faiza was 21. The youngest in the group was 18-year-old Aqsa Kalhoro, a pre-medical student. Asked what was to become of her studies if she was going to become a bus driver, she said that maybe she would become a bus doctor. “Or a good bus mechanic,” she corrected herself.
Most women drivers had another life before they hopped on the buses as drivers.
Humaira Mustafa, a working mother, said that she used to teach students how to read the Holy Quran for nine years, before becoming a schoolteacher.
Shafaq Shafiq, another young mother, was hoping to continue her education as she also wanted to go for a Master’s course at the University of Karachi. Uzma said that she had also done beautician and restaurant management courses.
All said that they found out that SMTA was looking for women bus drivers either through the newspaper advertisements, the social media or through friends who had seen such announcements.

2,‘Centre yet to issue NOC for military-grade weapons’,IGP seeks CM’s help in getting Rs2.7bn funds for anti-dacoit operation in riverine areas.,"KARACHI: Sindh police are still awaiting NOC (no objection certificate) from federal government for the procurement of military-grade weapons and surveillance equipment required to eliminate growing menace of banditry in the riverine areas of Sukkur and Larkana police ranges, according to official sources and papers viewed by Dawn on Thursday.
Informed sources said that incidents of kidnapping for ransom in the katcha (riverine) areas of Ghotki, Sukkur, Shikarpur and Kandhkot-Kashmore have registered over 113pc increase last year as compared to 2022.
The provincial government had already earmarked over Rs2 billion for the procurement of the modern arms and equipment but the funds could not be utilised mainly for want of NOC from the federal government. Therefore, the sources said, Sindh IGP Riffat Mukhtar Raja had recently taken up this issue with caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retired) Maqbool Baqar.
The provincial police chief has also raised the issue of promised allowance for over 4,000 policemen working in the riverine areas of the two police ranges with the CM.

IGP seeks CM’s help in getting Rs2.7bn funds for anti-dacoit operation in riverine areas

He urged the caretaker CM to help get the NOC for the funds amounting to Rs2.776 billion for the procurement of ‘sophisticated field weapon and surveillance equipment’.
The official correspondence shows that the funds were allocated in the financial year 2022-23 but could not be utilised as the Ministry of Interior had not yet issued the NOC.
“These weapons are required for police operations against the dacoits in Katcha area of Sindh i.e. district Ghotki, Sukkur, Shikarpur and Kashmore,” contented the IGP.
He pointed out that the issue of NOC was still pending.
Contending that since the funds could not be carried forward, the Sindh police needed these funds to be reallocated ‘outside budget’ through the provincial cabinet’s approval.
Regarding the issue of ‘katcha allowance’ for the police personnel working in the highly dangerous riverine areas, the sources quoting the official correspondence said that the IGP Sindh told the CM that the provincial cabinet had on June 6 last year approved the allowance of Rs10,000 each for the 4,500 personnel. However, the Sindh police chief said, minutes of cabinet’s meeting were yet to be issued. Once the minutes were issued, the home department would take up the matter with the finance department for the release of the funds, he added.
According to the sources, IGP Riffat Raja informed the CM that the “targeted operation is under way with the help of Rangers which had resulted in 90pc decrease in the kidnapping for ransom and road robbery cases”.
He said that the focused and effective approach was adopted in detecting and handling ‘honey-trap’ cases.
The IGP was quoted as having told the CM that no extra-judicial measures helped police gain local people’s trust and support.’
He pointed out that till Nov 26, 2023, a total of 47 persons were kidnapped for ransom in the Sukkur police range; out of them, 45 were recovered. Similarly, during the same period, a total 137 persons were kidnapped for ransom in the Larkana division and 136 of them were recovered.
However, official sources said, recently, 13 persons were kidnapped in Shikarpur district and 15 in Kandhkot-Kashmore district.

5,CM hands over eight snorkels to six Sindh cities,"Three snorkels handed over to Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and one each to Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur and Larkana.","KARACHI: Caretaker Chief Minister of Sindh Justice (retired) Maqbool Baqar on Thursday handed over eight snorkels, procured for Rs1.35 billion, to the municipal corporations of Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas and Larkana.
The snorkels distribution ceremony was hosted by Local Government Minister Mubin Jumani in the office of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation.
The ceremony was attended by Sindh Information Minister Ahmad Shah, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Hyderabad Mayor Kashif Shoro, LG Secretary Manzoor Shaikh, other mayors and officials.
The CM handed over three snorkels to Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and one each to Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur and Larkana. 
Addressing the ceremony, the chief minister highlighted a grave issue related to the high-rise buildings in Karachi. He pointed out that many of these buildings lacked proper firefighting systems, equipment and fire exits. “In the event of a fire, the residents living on higher floors are at great risk of getting trapped, which can lead to the loss of both life and property,” he added.
Justice Baqar emphasised the importance of having a proper firefighting mechanism in place. “To achieve this, the provincial government has already ordered a fire safety audit of buildings,” he said, adding that the aim was to identify any defects in the buildings and see that builders rectified them to ensure safety of residents and occupants.
The chief minister stated that it was the shared responsibility of the government and civic agencies to ensure that there were adequate firefighting machines to handle fire incidents. “As a result, the government has been investing in buying fire trucks and snorkels for aerial firefighting,” he said.
Justice Baqar said that being the chief minister, he had fulfilled his commitment to the people of the province by providing aerial firefighting equipment, known as snorkels, to make their lives more secure.
He said that the snorkels imported from Indonesia were state-of-the-art firefighting machines. “Despite not having the required number of fire engines that cities like Karachi and others need, the snorkels are a step towards building more efficient firefighting departments that are well-equipped to handle fire incidents, ensuring the safety of residents,” he added.
The local government minister said that he had directed all local bodies to develop their firefighting systems for the protection of their people. “The firefighting system will ultimately become part of the Rescue 1122,” he added.
Local Government Secretary Manzoor Shaikh told the audience that the provincial government had originally ordered 15 snorkels but only eight could be procured due to the dollar-rupee parity. 
He said that the snorkels had arrived at the KPT but were currently stuck there due to customs duties. “However, the chief minister approved Rs350 million to get the snorkels released and they are now being handed over to the mayors,” he added.
KWSC control room
After launching the snorkels, the chief minister visited the KWSC control room. From there, the movement of the institution’s seven hydrants working in the city is monitored.
During the visit, the chief minister ordered the KW&SC to regulate the prices of water tankers, as there were complaints of overcharging.
Justice Baqar remarked that the purpose of establishing or running the hydrants was to provide water to the water-deficient areas, but the ‘private tanker mafia’ had turned it into a money-making source.
He asked the officers concerned to take immediate measures to stop this practice.

6,"PMA report calls for urgent, comprehensive reforms in health sector","The report advocates for better control measures, including vaccinations, to curb the spread of these deadly viral diseases.","KARACHI: The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) launched on Thursday its report on the country’s health status, highlighting the multi-faceted challenges confronting Pakistan in this sector, while calling for urgent comprehensive reforms.
“Pakistan faces an unprecedented health crisis, compounded by its status as the fifth most populous country globally. The World Health Organisation’s recent ranking, placing Pakistan at 124th out of 169 countries, should serve as a clarion call for an immediate revision of the nation’s health system,” the report titled ‘Health of the Nation 2024’, says.
The government, it says, has approved multiple drug price hikes, affecting over 80,000 drugs and burdening the populace. Inflation and the devaluation of the rupee have strained local drug production, making essential medication unaffordable, particularly for the poor,” the report says.
Pakistan faces a significant burden of Hepatitis B and C, with 15 million affected individuals. Lack of prevention, testing and treatment resources, along with the presence of quacks, contribute to the rising number of cases.
The report advocates for better control measures, including vaccinations, to curb the spread of these deadly viral diseases.
The report emphasises the need for addressing water quality issues to improve public health. Pakistan experiences a rapid rise in HIV infections, with 63,202 registered cases.
“Unsafe drinking water is a major health concern, causing a high number of deaths. Contaminated water contributes to 40 per cent of deaths nationwide, leading to waterborne diseases, with diarrhoea being a leading cause of infant mortality,” it says.
Limited testing capacity, unsafe practices like syringe reuse and poor awareness contribute to the spread of HIV. The report calls for increased testing, awareness and access to lifesaving treatment to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis.
The report stresses the importance of investing in preventive measures against diseases and calls for increased health budget allocation. It also highlights the consequences of climate change affecting healthcare. Despite contributing less than one per cent to the global carbon footprint, Pakistan faces significant challenges, emphasising the need for adaptive strategies and international assistance.
Pakistan faces a double burden of disease, with high rates of various illnesses. The report highlights demographic challenges, high maternal mortality, infectious diseases, lifestyle-related health issues, inadequate access to clean water and environmental pollution. Urgent action, increased investment and policy reforms, the report says, are essential for creating a healthier and more resilient nation.
Concern over diabetes
According to the report, Pakistan ranks third globally in the prevalence of diabetes. It stresses the severity of the diabetes situation, calling for concerted efforts to address this health crisis.
Early detection, intervention and preventive measures are crucial to mitigate the increasing burden on the healthcare system. The report also sheds light on the alarming statistics related to road traffic accidents and air pollution.
Improving healthcare indicators in Pakistan is a complex task that requires long-term planning and systemic reforms. Here are some recommendations to enhance the healthcare system in the country:
The report recommends that the government prepare a people-friendly National Health Policy based on the ground realities of the country.
“Focus on enhancing primary healthcare services at the grassroots level, particularly in rural areas. This can be achieved by increasing the number of primary healthcare centres, improving the training of staff and ensuring the availability of essential drugs and equipment.”
It urged the government to enhance the healthcare workforce and improve accessibility and affordability. “This can include expanding health insurance coverage, reducing out-of-pocket costs and implementing targeted subsidies for essential medicines and treatments.”

It demanded fixing support price of wheat at Rs5,000 per 40kg, rejecting outright the plan of corporate farming.
The demand was raised at a meeting chaired by SAI president Nawab Zubair Talpur here on Thursday. 
The meeting said that price hike should be given serious consideration while fixing the support price for the grain. 
It rejected raise in the price of urea fertiliser by the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) and said that the price should be reduced because farmers were already not getting the fertiliser.
The SAI leaders expressed concern over the sale of urea in the black-market and its unavailability to farmers. The hoarding of the fertiliser was at its peak, said the meeting. 
The meeting said the SAI did not accept the raise in urea’s price and demanded an end to the shortage of the farm input and its sale on the black.
It asserted that Sindh did not get a single bag of the imported urea, which was condemnable and urged the government to ensure imported urea’s quota was supplied to Sindh. The urea meant for farmers was being provided to big landlords, it said. 
The meeting claimed that urea had been transported to Punjab in larger quantities.
Rejecting the plan of the corporate farming, the meeting condemned registration of FIR against the farmers who were protesting against the shortage of urea and urged the Sindh High Court to take notice of the cases field against them. 
The meeting demanded withdrawal of cases and action against those responsible for their registration. 
It expressed concern over the shortage of water in the command area of Nara and Rohri canals, which it said was artificial.
The meeting noted that the shortage had badly disturbed farmers and affected the wheat crop which was being cultivated. If the wheat crop was affected, it could lead to food insecurity in Sindh, it warned. 
The meeting maintained that the desilting of channels was not done by the irrigation staff and famers were asked to bear bills of fuel and machinery. It accused the irrigation officials of demanding bribe from the growers. It said the suspension of the Sukkur Barrage chief engineer for two months raised many questions.
The meeting was attended by Mohammad Anwar Kamboh, Javed Riar, Sharif Nizamani, Mir Subedar Talpur, Zafarullah Tal­pur, Mohib Ali Mari and others.

The procession started from the National Press Club and culminated outside the SP office after passing through different thoroughfares, where the protesters staged a sit-in.The protesters’ leaders Mohammed Younis Rajper, Moula Bux Mashori, M. Zafar Tagar and others said that Naushahro Feroze police had miserably failed to maintain the law and order in the district.
They said that the incidents of robberies, snatching of vehicles and murders were on the rise and even policemen on duty had become victims of criminals over the last few months but authorities appeared helpless before the outlaws.
They said that instead of taking action against the outlaws, three journalists, including Majid Tagar, Zameer Hussain Lund and Khalid Chandio, were booked in bogus cases by the SHO of Naushahro Feroze whereas other newsmen were also being threatened of dire consequences.
They alleged that the SHO had booked their colleagues only for highlighting crime.
The protesters were also joined by leaders of Sindh United Party, PPP-SB, Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, the Shehri Ittehad and others, who also demanded immediate suspension of the SHO.
The journalists demanded the Sindh IGP, Shaheed Benazirabad DIG and Naushahro Feroze SP suspend the SHO and withdraw the fake cases lodged against the three newsmen. 
They threatened that the journalist community would hold a sit-in outside the Chief Minister House in Karachi on Jan 25 if the authorities failed to meet their demands.
Naushahro Feroze SP Suhai Aziz said three cases were registered on different complaints: one was from taluka municipal officer, other was of a theft lodged by a citizen whereas the third one was related to a fraud related to the Benazir Income Support Programme.
She said she had also constituted an inquiry committee and the SHO was not found guilty in the probe.
She said that the media was an important pillar of society, but journalists were also part of the society and humans and if they were found involved in any crime, cases would definitely be registered against them.

Chandio, who is also convener of Jeay Sindh Rahbar Committee, said at a meeting held here on Thursday that the practice of occupying land by tampering with revenue record had been going on for past 15 years. 
He said that now the caretaker provincial government had handed over land to companies for corporate farming although it had no mandate to do so. 
He condemned the revenue department’s decision to lease out lands to the companies and said that farmland should be handed over to Sindhi people who were facing hunger and starvation.
He said that funds were not utilised on Sindhi people’s welfare but now their lands were being described as ‘occupied’ under a new survey although they had been living on their land for centuries. 
Rulers were not ready to spend the revenue earned from oil and gas on people of Sindh, he said. 
Chandio announced that his party would observe the 120th birth anniversary of G.M. Syed in Sann on Jan 17.
