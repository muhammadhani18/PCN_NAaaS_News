0,CII advocates stringent laws to curb child abuse,Activist says most missing children belong to working class,"ISLAMABAD: Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) Chairman Qibla Ayaz has stressed the need for legislation entailing strict punishment in cases of child abuse and kidnapping, as speakers highlighted the multi-dimensional nature of the issue.
Speaking at a seminar titled “Addressing the plight of missing children and the corresponding legal framework in Pakistan”, the CII chief said that political instability and social discord created space for “evil forces in society to easily commit various crimes, including child abductions and serial abuse”.
Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said the issue of missing children and child abuse could not be resolved by any single institution as only collective wisdom and collaboration could be the effective remedy. He said that the diverse professional and social background of the speakers highlights the multi-dimensional nature of the issue.
Director General of Zainab Alert Response and Recovery Agency (ZARRA) Dr Jahanzeb Khan said that the agency was mandated to issue alerts when a report for a missing child is made through the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). He informed the audience that law enforcement agencies were responsible for immediately lodging FIRs for missing children and also notifying ZARRA.

He highlighted that the law-enforcement agencies notified 2,271 cases out of which 1411 children were recovered. He maintained that the protection of children was a shared responsibility and that progress in these domains was not possible without collective efforts.
Dr Syed Kaleem Imam, former federal secretary, stressed the need to address the root cause of the issue and ensure the safety of children.
Addressing the underlying psychological and social causes behind such predatory behaviour is crucial, he said, adding that strengthening of law enforcement agencies must go hand in hand with scaling up individual responsibility. 
He also suggested the sensitisation and capacity building of law enforcement personnel, especially women police officers.
Dr Tabassum Naz, a Federal Directorate of Education director, stressed the need for preventative measures. “We need to identify the weak links and address the root causes,” she said, adding that a proactive approach could save the children from such mishaps. She pointed out that our society being male-dominant, was more relaxed about the security of boys, which was contributing to the higher prevalence of missing reports among boys.
Roshni Helpline 1138 Executive Director Muhammad Ali shared that Roshni Helpline assisted over 20,000 families and successfully recovered more than 9,600 children.
In 2023, he said, their helpline received 2,633 cases, with 658 families still awaiting the return of their loved ones. Notably, 70 per cent of the cases reported in the last five years involved boys, and children aged between 11 to 17.
He said according to their findings about 99 per cent of the missing children hailed from from the working class. 
He also highlighted the challenges faced by the Roshni helpline, including a lack of awareness about ZARRA Act 2020, which significantly contributed to the safety, security, recovery, and rehabilitation of missing children.

The show was curated by Aasim Akhtar at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts, Visual Arts Division. This groundbreaking showcase featured the works of both national and international photographers, offering thoughtful exploration of their diverse perspectives and compelling narratives.
The group show included Ali Mehdi Zaidi, Arif Mehmood, Ayesha Vellani, Aysha Bilal, Hamid Moinuddin, Lukas Werth, Malcom Hutcheson, Shehzad Noorani, Stephan Andrew, William Dalrymple, and Zaheer Chaudry.
The exhibition was inaugurated by Y. Kistafin, who is the Ambassador of Kazakhstan, in a ceremony along with the Director General of PNCA, Ayub Jamali. Present on the opening day were photographers Ayesha Bilal, Zaheer Chaudhry, and Arif Mehmood, whose contributions to the field were appreciated by the enthusiastic audience.
Under the theme of “Retelling the Story of Pakistani Photographers’ Journey,” Aasim Akhtar’s curation aimed to provide a fresh perspective on the significant and often overlooked work of Pakistani photographers. The exhibition emphasised the importance of revisiting their narratives, fostering connections among peers, and encouraging a collective reflection on their shared responsibility as witnesses to history.
This exhibition defied conventional expectations, rejecting hierarchy and showcasing a diverse array of works that coalesced to form a captivating narrative. Aasim Akhtar’s selection process focused on initiating a dialogue among the photographers, allowing them to communicate with each other through their images and share their unique visions with the public. The exhibition emphasised the deep mutual respect within the photography community, highlighting that no photographer or genre was deemed greater or nobler than another.

As Aasim Akhtar aptly put it, “I have eschewed hierarchy because, in photography, it does not exist. What does exist is a deep mutual respect. No photographer is greater than another; no genre nobler than the next.”
This captivating exhibition showcased the convergence of diverse views, turning the photographers’ gaze on the world and scrutinising it fragment by fragment. Each photograph, regardless of style or subject, serves as a testament to the photographers’ compulsive urge to bear witness to the human experience.
The exhibition was open to the public at PNCA until February 13, offering an immersive journey through the lens of these talented photographers. Organisers urged people to avail themselves of the opportunity to witness the collective power of their perspectives as they invited art lovers to contemplate fragility, the ephemeral nature of life, and the traces people left behind.

City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani said if the record of purchase, sale and repair of mobile phones was not compiled, the officers concernedincluding SHO of the police station concernedwill be held responsible.
The move came about after a considerable increase in snatching and theft of mobile phones in Rawalpindi was recorded with the police. In the Rawalpindi district, 20 to 25 mobile phones are either stolen or taken almost every day.
Mobile phone dealers have also been bound to keep a record of mobile phones they buy and sell so that the incidents of mobile phone snatching and theft could be prevented and technicians have also been asked not to change software of stolen mobile phones.
CPO Khalid Hamdani chalked assigned the task to the Rawalpindi police at the police station level of keeping complete record of those who come for repairs, while making monitoring stricter.
By getting all the mobile phone dealers and technicians in the limits to install the e-gadget software of the Punjab Police, Indulge them to update the entries in the software at the same time whenever they buy, sell and repair a mobile phone.

5,HRCP seeks statutory national commission for minorities’ rights,JUI-F representative Aasia Nasir says that a national commission for minorities must be people-oriented.,"ISLAMABAD: A national roundtable convened by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Thursday called for the establishment of a statutory national commission for the rights of minorities as per the recommendation of the 2014 Supreme Court Jillani judgement.
HRCP’s director Farah Zia recalled that the national commission for minorities that was set up in 2020 failed to meet the demands of minorities. She underscored the need for an autonomous commission established along the lines of the Paris Principles.
A statement issued by HRCP said that representatives from minority groups, political parties, and government departments, the Ministry of Human Rights, the National Commission for Human Rights, and rights organisations proposed several recommendations regarding the setup of such a commission.
Pritam Das Rathi from the Hindu community said that the majority of the members must be minorities. Furthermore, the commission must report on the state of minorities’ rights to the prime minister on a quarterly basis. Professor Mehar Dad from the Bahai community said that the commission’s role must extend to all provinces and regions.
Father Sarfraz Simon from the Christian community pointed out that the school curriculum must be reformed to remove hate speech and reflect the role of minorities in the formation of Pakistan. Mahmood Iftikhar from the Ahmadiyya community added that the commission must be inclusive of the rights of vulnerable groups such as Ahmadis, who had experienced numerous desecrations of their sites of worship in 2023.
Rights activist Peter Jacob said that the Jillani judgement addressed majoritarian imbalances in institutions. The work of national human rights institutions was complementary to the executive, not parallel to it. He further urged political parties to include the implementation of the Jillani judgement in their election manifestos.
JUI-F representative Aasia Nasir said that a national commission for minorities must be people-oriented, with separate budgetary allocations and a clear mandate. Dr Shoaib Suddle from the Suddle Commission emphasised how societal attitudes must change, to which HRCP council member Farhatullah Babar added that addressing majoritarian bias was necessary given the refusal to accept the validity of such a commission.
HRCP council member Hina Jilani recommended developing a statute for a commission after a wide consultation, adding that Ahmadi representatives be included in the commission to uphold their rights. The Supreme Court must also make an implementation plan for the Jillani judgement, and mob mentality to block progressive legislation must be discouraged.
Concluding the discussion, HRCP’s secretary-general, Harris Khalique, said that the national commission for the rights of minorities must meet internal accountability mechanisms along with the Paris Principles in terms of its composition, mandate, authority, and resources. Salman Farrukh from HRCP, who moderated the roundtable, announced the launch of an HRCP awareness campaign for the implementation of the Jillani Judgement.

When PRO was asked about the IGP’s announcement, he replied that he had also seen the video and will comment after getting a reply from the IGP, but later he was not available.
In the announcement made publicly the IGP said, “All police officials and the public are listening. It will be our duty to avenge the killing of a policeman. This is a message to everyone…we are not only here to offer funeral prayers [of fallen policemen].

7,FGEHA board directs revival of Kashmir Apartment Project,"Revised PC-I cost could be Rs32.7bn compared to original estimate of Rs15.07b, says official","ISLAMABAD: The executive board of the Federal Government Employees Housing Authority (FGEHA) on Thursday directed the authority to take steps for the revival of Kashmir Apartment Project.
The board, which met with Secretary Housing and Works Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash in the chair, besides other agenda items discussed the slow progress of work on the project. 
The board was told that work on the project was started in May 2020 and its completion time was three years - May 2023. Before the start of the project worth Rs15.7 billion, its foundation stone was laid by then prime minster Imran Khan in April 2019.
Later, the project was halted due to cost escalation. The FGEHA board was told that till date only 16 per cent work had been done. 
“Yes, today board directed us to revive this project, now we will take further steps,” said an officer of FGEHA. Asked if the authority will revise the PC-I and will go for fresh tendering, the officer said various proposals and way forwards were presented before the board and the best option was okayed.

Revised PC-I cost could be Rs32.7bn compared to original estimate of Rs15.07b, says official

“In short, I can say we have been given a go ahead,” he said.
On the other hand, sources said upon execution of an amicable settlement agreement with the contractor in the light of 27th meeting of the executive board, now it was imperative to revisit the construction cost as per latest rate of Public Works Department. The sources said analysis of current status of allotment, receipt so far and outstanding amount of allottees also suggest that there was no other possible way to make the project financially viable and sustainable except cost/price enhancement. 
“Keeping above in view, revised construction cost was estimated by the engineer as Rs29.411 billion. Based on such a cost, revised PC-I cost would be approximately Rs32.702 billion compared to the original PC-I cost of Rs15.07 billion,” said an officer of FGEHA.
He said three options were placed before the board: (a) increase in cost per square foot from Rs5070 to Rs11459 (b) readjustment of amenities like converting amenities at ground floor in block I &3 into saleable commercial area and (c) addition of one commercial floor.
“The board while directing revival of this project accepted one of above three mentioned proposals and we in minutes of the meeting will be formally conveyed,” said the FGEHA officer.
The project consists of three towers, each with a basement and ground plus 21 floors. The design consists of 1,467 apartments out of which 714 will have an area of 1,300 square feet each while 753 apartments will have an area of 11 square feet. The basements of the buildings will be reserved for car parking and the ground floors for amenities.
The executive board also approved swapping of a five-star hotel in Mauve Area of G-13, G-14 with a hospital plot in the nearest area to attract investors. Sources said the existing hotel plot being located at main junction was not feasible, but it was ideal for a hospital, therefore, the board approved swapping of these plots.
Similarly, the board also discussed issues of Park Road housing scheme of FGEHA and the Life Style Residency project, which is being executed by authority in a joint venture with a private firms in G-13.

8,First Cyber Crime Investigation Unit set up,ISLAMABAD: First Cyber Crime Investigation Unit was set up in the capital police to combat digital offenses.,"ISLAMABAD: First Cyber Crime Investigation Unit was set up in the capital police to combat digital offenses.
The police said here on Thursday the Cyber Crime Investigation Unit within the Pakistan police had been officially established as part of Islamabad Police’s efforts to strengthen the fight against cyber crime.
This milestone initiative comes on the heels of amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), empowering Islamabad police to register cyber crime cases under Section 30.
Seeking to harness specialised expertise, Islamabad police have collaborated with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to leverage technical assistance in the investigation of cyber crimes.
The partnership is geared towards addressing the intricate challenges posed by cyber threats and ensuring a robust response to the evolving landscape of digital offenses. The unit has been established and the successful completion of the first phase of training for 60 officers from Islamabad Police, in collaboration with the FIA, marks a crucial step in building a skilled workforce proficient in handling cyber crime cases.
These officers have undergone specialized training to equip them with the knowledge and tools necessary for effective cybercrime investigations.
To streamline and centralize efforts, the Cyber Crime Investigation Unit has been established at the F-6 Service Center. This state-of-the-art facility will serve as a hub for coordinating and conducting in-depth investigations into cybercrimes, providing a dedicated space for experts to analyze and respond to digital offenses.
Operating under the authority of CPO Safe City/Traffic and the oversight of SSP Safe City, the officers of the Cyber Crime Investigation Unit will execute their responsibilities with precision, ensuring a thorough and coordinated strategy in addressing cyber threats.
In a citizen-friendly move, individuals are encouraged to approach any police station to request the inclusion of cybercrime cases, fostering community involvement in the fight against digital offenses.
The F-6 Cyber Crime Investigation Unit is set to become operational from January 15, further fortifying Islamabad’s capabilities in combating cyber threats.

The CDA auctioned a plot for an apartment in Diplomatic Enclave, measuring 3888.88 square yards against Rs 860,000 per square yard, for a total cost of Rs 3.3 billion. After the sale of this plot, the CDA in two days fetched around 11 billion rupees, which is a great sigh of relief for the cash-strapped CDA.
On the first day, the CDA auctioned four plots for Rs 7.79 billion. The civic agency has been facing financial constraints that forced it to hold this auction just three months after the last auction, contrary to past practice, when the civic agency used to hold auctions normally after a six-month gap. 
An officer of CDA said that the civic agency, which is facing financial challenges, had no other options but to hold an auction.

10,"Most voters without CNICs, face damaged pathways in flood-hit areas: report",Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives calls for immediate action to ensure eligible voters receive their CNICs before elections.,"ISLAMABAD: The Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI) in a report claimed that lack of Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs) and damaged pathways to polling stations jeopardise participation of the flood-affected communities in the upcoming general elections.
A study by CPDI, conducted in Sindh and Balochistan, identifies multiple issues of flood-affected communities which may adversely affect the voter turnout. It shows key issues, notably the absence of CNICs and damaged pathways to potential polling stations or school buildings.
 
 

While highlighting the issues, CPDI urged authorities to take immediate measures to facilitate voter turnout in the flood-affected areas specifically in Khairpur, Naushahro Feroz, Naseerabad and Jaffarabad.
The qualitative assessment was undertaken in the severely affected provinces of Sindh and Balochistan, highlighting various critical issues, including the absence and delays in obtaining national identity cards, damaged infrastructure such as roads and designated polling stations/school buildings, waning interest in political leaders due to insufficient post-disaster rehabilitation efforts, and concerns about the displaced community’s return to exercise their voting rights.
Additionally, individuals with lifelong injuries may be bedridden, posing a challenge for their participation in the general election (GE) 2024. These findings underscore the multifaceted challenges affecting the electoral landscape in flood-affected regions.
A significant number of flood victims lost their CNICs (at least one in every household), delays in renewal of CNICs are primarily because of the crowded and limited number of Nadra centres established at village level, residents added that mobile registration vans of Nadra initially helped but were later discontinued.
“Furthermore, daily wage earners also find it financially burdensome to visit Nadra centres. CPDI urges the authorities to take immediate action to ensure that eligible voters in flood-affected regions receive their CNICs before elections. Moreover, damaged roads and access tracks force voters to take longer alternative routes to reach polling stations, reported in all villages of selected districts in Sindh and Balochistan.
“Increased distances, combined with high transportation costs, will likely discourage voters, particularly women, elderly, differently-abled and low-income individuals, from travelling to cast their votes. With over 40pc of school buildings damaged and incomplete recovery efforts, newly designated polling stations may be distant, posing accessibility challenges for flood-affected residents on polling day without adequate transportation,” the report stated.
Over 10 million individuals faced displacement and 2.1 million homes were damaged in Sindh and approximately 100,000 in Balochistan, findings of the report reveal that due to financial constraints, there is a possibility that low-income migrated families will not return to cast their votes.

He said that Rawalpindi city is already very densely populated, and traffic problems are increasing with each passing day. In such a case, such bazaars being established in the centre of the city not only cause traffic disruption but also pose a security risk. Therefore, a complete ban is being imposed on them, and strict legal action will be taken against the violators under Section 144 already imposed by the Deputy Commissioner.
He expressed these views while presiding over a meeting held at the Commissioner’s Office, Rawalpindi. Additional Commissioner Coordination Syed Nazarat Ali, CTO Taimur, Secretary RTA Rashid Ali, Chief Officer Municipal Corporation Amjad Chaudhry, DSP Rafaqat, Dr. Zanira, and other concerned officers participated in this meeting.
Liaquat Ali Chatha directed that all concerned officers should be present in the field and ensure the implementation of Section 144. He directed Municipal Corporation officers to hold a meeting with the Car Dealers Association and sensitise them about the ban. He said that in the next phase, an empty place outside the city will be identified where ‘jumma bazaar’ vehicles can be set up so that this economic activity can continue as per the rules and regulations.

12,IHC order on MPO renders Islamabad administration ‘dysfunctional’,Commissioner’s office to file intra-court appeal against the verdict this week.,"ISLAMABAD: The judgement of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that stripped the deputy commissioner of his powers to detain individuals under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) law, has rendered the capital administration dysfunctional since the court order also declared the framework to govern the city ultra vires.
Sources in the chief commissioner’s office said that the Offices of the Registrar Cooperative Societies, Board of Revenue, Labour Department etc have become dormant in light of the judgement. They said an appeal against the judgement would be filed before the division bench this week.
Before 1980, Islamabad was governed by a naib-tehsildar of the Punjab government. The order of 1980 introduced the concept of a provincial government but without any chosen representatives.
According to senior lawyer Raja Inam Ameen Minhas, the chief commissioner was no longer the administrator of the federal capital unless the IHC’s order was suspended or set aside.
In light of the order, people are facing difficulties at the district administration offices regarding their routine work, as the officials have refused to entertain their applications, saying the admin is no longer legally empowered to process their correspondence.

Commissioner’s office to file intra-court appeal against the verdict this week

Senior lawyer Kashif Ali Malik said that the IHC protected the previous orders and acts of the chief commissioner or district administration, but the judgement specifically mentioned that the court order would be applicable prospectively.
The deputy commissioner Islamabad when contacted, replied that the order took away his powers under the MPO, while presidential orders were related to the chief commissioner and he may be approached.
IHC ruling
Justice Babar Sattar last week issued an 83-page judgement on the plea of PTI leader Sheharyar Afridi and took away the powers of the DC to issue detention orders under the MPO.
Justice Sattar also declared “PO [presidential order] No. 18 of 1980, PO No. 2 of 1987, PO No. 2 of 1990 and notifications issued under-declaring the administrator or chief commissioner Islamabad to be the provincial government for purposes of ICT are ultra vires of the Constitution and therefore declared to be void”.
Presidential Order 18 of 1980 “conferred executive authority of the federation to an administrator for the Islamabad Capital Territory, later designated as a chief commissioner Islamabad”.
Presidential Order No. 2 of 1987 provided that the president may, at any time, by order in writing direct that the executive authority of the federation in respect of ‘Islamabad Capital Territory’, in so far as it relates to any matter specified in the order, shall be exercised by such authority and the chief commissioner was designated to govern the federal capital. The order of 1990 further empowered the chief commissioner.
The judgement asked the federal government to govern Islamabad till the rules to operate the provincial government were finalised. The court also set a three-month deadline to frame the rules.
The verdict also cited the 2016 Supreme Court Mustafa Impex case, which requires decision or exercise of authority by the government concerning Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), whether as federal or provincial governments by the federal cabinet as collegium.
The judgment also cited the population census of 2023 and said approximately 2.364 million citizens live in the federal capital. Article 1(2)(b) of the Constitution identifies ICT as the federal capital that does not form part of any province.
But the State claims that pursuant to Presidential Order 18 of 1980 – enacted by General Zia-ul-Haq, who abrogated the Constitution after imposing Martial Law in 1977, and usurped the authority of the State and arrogated it to himself – read together with Presidential Order No. 2 of 1987 and Presidential Order No. 2 of 1990, the Chief Commissioner Islamabad – a civil servant serving in Basic Scale-20 – is one-man provincial government for ICT and its denizens.
The judgement also explained that Article 99 of the Constitution creates a mandatory obligation for the federal government to frame rules for the allocation of its business and such business of the federal government includes the power, duties and functions to be discharged in its capacity as the provincial government.
The declaration of the high court that the federal government was also the provincial government for ICT and the chief commissioner was not the provincial government for ICT would only apply prospectively and would not affect past and closed transactions.
The judgement was clear when it explained that notwithstanding the time frame provided for framing appropriate Rules of Business for purposes of ICT, any decision ought to be taken by the provincial government under any law for the time in force in ICT can only be taken by the federal cabinet.

13,PML-N announces candidates for two NA seats in Islamabad,"ISLAMABAD: After ceding one of the three seats of National Assembly in Islamabad to an ally, PML-N on Thursday...","ISLAMABAD: After ceding one of the three seats of National Assembly in Islamabad to an ally, PML-N on Thursday awarded tickets for the two constituencies to old and defeated faces.
Following the award of tickets for NA-46 and NA-48 and a setback of seat adjustment in NA-47, the prevailing situation is said to be unconducive for PML-N in the capital which remained a stronghold of the PTI after the party made a clean sweep in 2018 elections and grabbed all three seats of the lower house of parliament.
According to a notification issued by the PML-N, Anjum Aqeel Khan has been given ticket for NA-46 and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry for NA-48.
Interestingly, the party on Wednesday issued a list of candidates for NA seats in which there was no mention of Anjum Aqeel but another PML-N aspirant Zeeshan Ali Naqvi was on the top of the list from NA-46. 
When contacted, PML-N leader Irfan Siddiqui confirmed that the party had awarded tickets to Anjum Aqeel and Tariq Fazal.
PLM-N’s local candidates recently met a setback when their leadership made a seat adjustment agreement with newly formed Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) comprising mostly disgruntled leaders of PTI. Under the reported agreement, IPP’s Amir Kiani will be the joint candidate of both the parties from NA-47 and therefore Tariq Fazal Chaudhry has to cede his stronghold and was compelled to contest elections from NA-48 from where he had already faced a defeat in 2018 polls when he stood on the third position in terms of the number of secured votes against PTI’s winner Khurram Shahzad Nawaz.
In addition to former MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan, who lost two consecutive general elections on this seat, and one local government election, former Islamabad deputy mayor Zeeshan Naqvi and PML-N Japan President Malik Noor were vying for NA-46.
Observers believed that Zeeshan Naqvi had better prospects of winning the election due to his “personal relations not only within the party ranks and voters in his constituency but also with those in the opposition”.
According to the list issued on Wednesday, the PML-N had chosen Zeeshan Naqvi for the slot but it seemed the party changed its decision at the eleventh hour and replaced him with Anjum Aqeel.
The party’s lack of interest in capital’s three constituencies is evident from the fact that no one has so far contacted other candidates of the PML-N to withdraw their nomination papers or announce support to the party’s candidates.
Talking to Dawn, Zeeshan Ali Naqvi confirmed that he had so far not been called by the party to withdraw his nomination papers.
Past result 2013
NA-46 (formerly NA-48): Makhdoom Javed Hashmi won this seat on PTI’s ticket with 73,692 votes while PML-N candidate Anjum Aqeel Khan secured 48,073. As Mr Hashmi also vacated this seat, another PTI candidate Asad Umar contested by-election and grabbed the seat with 48,073 votes while PML-N candidate Ashraf Gujjar received 41,186 votes.
Results of 2018
NA-46 (formerly NA-54): In this constituency PTI leader Asad Umar became laurel by securing 56,945 votes, while Anjum Aqeel of PML-N got 32,991 votes and Raja Imran Ashraf stood on fifth position with only 4,019 votes.
