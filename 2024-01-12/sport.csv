Fulham took a first-half lead with a goal from Willian and then sat back and looked to hit Liverpool on the break, frustrating Juergen Klopp’s side until the 68th minute when Jones and then Gakpo struck in quick succession to give the Reds a slender advantage ahead of the second leg at Craven Cottage on January 24. 
Klopp’s men have now fallen behind in 14 games this season, but have won seven of those matches and lost just three. 
“It’s the mentality in the group, in the club, in the city, just keep going and it doesn’t matter what happens and we showed that again today,” Gakpo told Sky Sports. “If you’ve got that mentality, a lot of beautiful things can happen.” 
Fulham threatened to hand the record nine-time League Cup winners their first home defeat across all competitions this season after Willian scored in the 19th minute. Capitalising on Virgil van Dijk’s poor clearance, the Brazilian slotted home from the edge of the six-yard box between keeper Caoimhin Kelleher’s legs. 
Premier League-leading Liverpool dominated possession and finally got the better of Fulham’s well-organised back line when Jones netted, his shot from 25 metres out taking a big deflection off the back of Tosin Adarabioyo. 
Substitute Gakpo, who has scored in all four of his League Cup games for Liverpool, fired the home team in front in the 71st, tapping in Darwin Nunez’s cross at the near post to send fans home happy after they extended their remarkable home record this season to 14 victories and two draws. 
Klopp’s side had 21 shots to Fulham’s six, and the addition of Gakpo and Nunez in the second half made all the difference. 
Liverpool remain the strong favourites to reach the Wembley final against either Middlesbrough or Chelsea next month. 
However, Fulham do have hope with home advantage to come in the second leg.

1,Umar slams ton for Wapda; SBP on verge of victory,KARACHI: Pakistan discard Umar Akmal struck his 18th first-class ton on Thursday to put Wapda ahead on the third day...,"KARACHI: Pakistan discard Umar Akmal struck his 18th first-class ton on Thursday to put Wapda ahead on the third day of the President’s Trophy fifth-round match against Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). 
Pakistan Television’s (PTV) Waqar Hussain and Mohammad Shahzad also recorded centuries against Higher Education Commission (HEC). Meanwhile, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) fought tooth and nail with the former gaining a slight upper hand.
At the UBL Sports Complex, Wapda set a target of 367 for SNGPL as they declared their second innings at 330-5. Earlier, continuing from their overnight score of 64-1, they lost an early wicket as Mohammad Akhlaq was removed by Arif Yaqoob before Ahmed Shehzad (70 off 139, 10 fours) added a valuable half-century as their lead mounted.
Skipper Umar (128 off 210, 12 fours and two sixes) boosted Wapda’s position in the match and Ayaz Tasawar’s 135-ball vigil yielded 60 runs before he was dismissed. 
Aiding Ali and Arif, Shehzad Gul, Mohammad Awais Anwar and Mubasir Khan also removed a batter each. SNGPL only faced five overs scoring 12 runs before stumps were drawn. They require 355 runs to win.
At the State Bank Stadium, PTV found themselves in the driving seat as they set a mammoth target of 407 for HEC. 
PTV’s fine batting performance was spearheaded by debutant Shahzad (100 off 134, 10 fours and four sixes) and Waqar Hussain (104 off 172, 10 fours and a six) as the pair put on a 180-run third-wicket partnership.
Hasan Mohsin (53 off 64 struck a fluent half-century while skipper Uzair Mumtaz’s (46 off 77, two fours and three sixes) batting effort was crucial to the team’s lead crossing the 400-run mark.
Aarish Ali Khan and Saad Khan picked up three wickets each while Asadullah Hamza, Mohammad Azab, Muneer Khan and Wahaj Riaz dismissed a batter each.
In reply, HEC’s opening batters put on a 60-run partnership before Wahaj Riaz (32 off 36) departed. Saad Khan was plucked by Jahandad Khan for just two runs while night watchman Mohammad Azab was dismissed for a three-ball duck with HEC reduced to 76-3 in 16 overs.
At the National Bank Stadium, SBP bowlers took 20.2 overs to take the remaining three KRL wickets who were dismissed for 169 after continuing from their overnight score of 101-7. 
Maaz Sadaqat (51 off 101, eight fours) departed after reaching his half-century while the last three KRL batters; Kashif Ali (36 off 55, four fours and a six), Arshadullah (run-a-ball 13, two fours) and Sirajuddin (14 not out off 36) chipped in with valuable contributions to push their total past 150.
SBP, who were set a target of 245, were reduced to 14-3 at the start of the chase as Kashif Ali wreaked havoc with the new ball dismissing Zain Abbas and Ali Usman for cheap scores while Usman Salahuddin copped a golden duck. 
Rameez Aziz (73 off 149, 12 fours) and Umar Amin’s (46 off 63, eight fours) fourth-wicket partnership of 76 brought back a semblance of stability in SBP’s innings before the latter was removed by Arshadullah.
Muhammad Irfan Khan (56 not out off 123, six fours) struck a dogged unbeaten half-century as he helped SBP inch close to the target. 
Rameez was dismissed late in the day by Sharoon Siraj and Mohammad Mohsin was the last casualty of the day. Ali Shan will accompany Irfan when SBP resume on Friday with 50 runs required to win with four wickets in hand.
Scores in brief: 
SNGPL vs WAPDA at UBL Sports Complex 
WAPDA 328-6 in 80 overs (Ahmed Shehzad 77, Ayaz Tasawar 75, Mohammad Saad 45 not out, Muhammad Akhlaq 41; Mubasir Khan 3-67, Mubasir Khan 3-67, Mohammad Awais Anwar 2-56, Kamran Ghulam 1-23) and 330-5 (decl.) in 98 overs (Umar Akmal 128, Ahmed Shehzad 70, Ayaz Tasawar 60; Shehzad Gul 1-33, Arif Yaqoob 1-48, Mohammad Ali 1-58, Mohamamd Awais Anwar 1-66, Mubasir Khan 1-79); SNGPL 292 in 73.3 overs (Abid Ali 147, Kamran Ghulam 41, Asad Shafiq 25; Asif Afridi 5-124, Khalid Usman 4-89) and 12-0 in 5 overs (Abid Ali 9 not out, Azhar Ali 2 not out)

2,Brazil turn  to Dorival Junior,"RIO DE JANEIRO: Dor­ival Junior, a Copa Liber­ta­dores and Brazilian Cup winner as manager of Fla­m­­engo, has...","RIO DE JANEIRO: Dor­ival Junior, a Copa Liber­ta­dores and Brazilian Cup winner as manager of Fla­m­­engo, has been named as Brazil coach, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said on Wednesday. 
The 61-year-old will take the reins of the five-time world champions after a turbulent period following their 2022 World Cup exit following a penalty shootout loss to Croatia, which led to the sacking of coach Tite. 
Brazil were led by Under-20 coach Ramon Menezes before the appointment on an interim basis of Fernando Diniz last year. 
Diniz was sacked on Friday, a day after Ednaldo Rodrigues was reinstated as head of the CBF following his dismissal in early December by the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. 
Rodrigues’ intention was to hire Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, but after negotiations failed and he opted to extend his contract with Real Madrid, Dorival was the main candidate. 
“Dorival Junior is the new coach of the men’s national team,” the CBF said in a statement. The CBF did not specify the length of his contract. Brazilian media reports said it would run through the 2026 World Cup. 
Under Diniz, the “Selecao” had racked up three straight losses in World Cup qualifiers, including a humiliating 1-0 loss at home to arch-rivals Argentina in November. 
Fans hope Dorival can restore the magic Brazil have largely failed to repeat since winning their last World Cup title in 2002. 
Dorival, who has coached Atletico Mineiro, Atletico Paranaense, Internacional, Vasco da Gama, Flumin­ense and Palmeiras, led Flamengo to the Copa Liber­tadores and Copa do Brasil in 2022 before joining Sao Paulo, who confirmed his decision to leave on Sunday. 
He is set to make his debut in March, when Bra­zil play England and Spain in a pair of friendlies. 
Restoring Brazil to their former glory will be no easy task. 
Dorival takes the reins of a struggling side, who have made a poor start to South American World Cup qualifying, and sit sixth in the standings with two wins from six games. 
They last reached the World Cup final in 2002 when they lifted the trophy for the last time and have made the semi-finals only once at the following five editions of the tournament.

MILAN: Teun Koopmeiners scored twice as Atalanta came back from a goal down to beat AC Milan 2-1 at the San Siro in their Coppa Italia quarter-final on Wednesday, while Lazio won 1-0 in a fiery derby with Roma AS which finished with three red cards. 
Rafael Leao broke the deadlock for Milan just before halftime with an elegant first-time finish from Theo Hernandez’s pass, but three minutes later an unmarked Koopmeiners received a ball from Emil Holm before guiding a shot into the far corner. 
Koopmeiners completed the comeback in the 59th minute when he converted a penalty after Alex Jimenez fouled Aleksei Miranchuk to continue Atalanta’s bid for a first major trophy since 1963, when they last won the competition. 
“We have done so much in recent years,” said Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini. “We might not have any silverware... but we have reached the Italian Cup final in the past and we want to go all the way.” 
Gasperini was sent off late in the first half after a heated conversation with the referee that persisted despite an initial warning. 
Under Gasperini, Atalanta have reached the Coppa semi-finals four times. 
Atalanta will play Fiorentina in a two-legged semi-final in April following Vincenzo Italiano’s side’s win over Bologna on penalties on Tuesday. 
Lazio secured a last-four clash with either Juventus or Frosinone courtesy of Mattia Zaccagni’s penalty five minutes after the break in Rome. 
Zaccagni broke the deadlock from the spot six minutes into the second half after Roma’s new signing Dean Huijsen had fouled Taty Castellanos. 
Roma came close to securing a late equaliser, but Lazio goalkeeper Christos Mandate made an impressive save from Andrea Belotti’s half-volley. 
To add to Roma manager Jose Mourinho’s woes, his Argentine forward Paulo Dybala was substituted at halftime due to injury. 
Lazio forward Pedro and his Roma counterpart Sardar Azmoun were both sent off in stoppage time as tempers flared, while Roma defender Gianluca Mancini was also dismissed for dissent after the final whistle. 
“We’re proud of the result because we think that our performance deserved it,” said Lazio owner Claudio Lotito to Mediaset. “Today the team showed itself to be a united and determined group, that’s what a football team needs to be.”

Lamichhane, 23, was once the poster boy for cricket in Nepal and the leg-spinner’s on-field success had boosted the sport’s profile in the Himalayan republic. In 2022, he was accused of raping a young woman in a Kathmandu hotel but was freed on bail and returned to the squad to compete in international tournaments. 
“We inform you that Sandeep Lamichhane has been suspended from any kind of domestic and international cricket activities as he has been convicted and sentenced,” Cricket Association of Nepal president Chatur Bahadur Chand said in a statement.

5,Australian Open fitness fears for Norrie after Auckland pullout,AUCKLAND: Britain’s world number 19 Cameron Norrie pulled out of the Auckland Classic with a wrist injury on...,"AUCKLAND: Britain’s world number 19 Cameron Norrie pulled out of the Auckland Classic with a wrist injury on Thursday, leaving his fitness in doubt just three days before the Australian Open.
American top seed Ben Shelton had just powered past Spain’s Roberto Carballes Baena 6-4, 6-3 when second seed Norrie withdrew from his quarter-final, handing Chile’s Alejandro Tabilo a walkover.
Tournament director Nicolas Lamperin said Norrie had woken with a sore left wrist and  “quickly found out that he wouldn’t be able to play” during his warm-up.
“He was pretty devastated when he told us. We all know how much this tournament means to him,” Lamperin added, with the first Grand Slam of the year starting on Sunday in Melbourne.
“He rushed straight away to the clinic to get a scan and obviously get some more clarity on what’s wrong.”
The 16th-ranked Shelton earlier reached his first semi-final since his maiden title win in Tokyo last year.
He broke Carballes Baena at 5-4 in the first set and at 4-3 in the second.
“He’s definitely one of the faster players I’ve played against, running down balls, passing shots,” said Shelton.
“But I felt like I brought out my best tennis in the big moments and I’m happy to be in a semi-final.”
Shelton will play Taro Daniel in the semi-finals after the Japanese player beat French qualifier Alexandre Muller 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3.
Arthur Fils, the sixth seed, will play Tabilo in the second semi-final with the French teenager’s quarter-final against Germany’s Daniel Altmaier also affected by injury.
After Fils took the first set and broke serve at the start of the second, Altmaier pulled out with an apparent back injury, leaving the 19-year-old as a 7-6 (7-2), 1-0 winner.

World number three Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion and last year’s Australian Open finalist, was stunned 6-3, 6-3 by Ekaterina Alexandrova, who led 4-0 in both sets.
American Paul crashed 6-1, 6-4 to Briton Jack Draper.
Alexandrova will now meet sixth seed Jelena Ostapenko, who survived a wobble in the first set but regained concentration to ease past Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk 7-5, 6-3.
One quarter-final was determined without a ball struck when Germany’s Laura Siegemund pulled out of her match with Russia’s Daria Kasatkina injured.
Kasatkina will play American second seed Jessica Pegula, who struggled to get past veteran qualifier Anastasia Pavyluchenkova 6-7 (1-7), 7-5, 6-4.
American Paul joined men’s second seed Nicolas Jarry of Chile on the sidelines at the last event prior to the Australian Open. Jarry lost 6-4, 7-5 to Czech Jiri Lehecka.
The 62nd-ranked Draper dominated the match against Paul from the start, running away with the first set and battling in the second to set up a semi-final against Alexander Bublik.
Russia’s Bublik ousted Italian fourth seed Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 7-5.
Third seed Sebastian Korda powered into the semi-finals for a second straight year, but needed five match points to set up a last four clash with seventh seed Lehecka. 
He defeated Christopher O’Connell 6-4, 6-4 to keep his dream alive of going one better this year.

The rivalry, the comeback and the stakes combined to make this arguably the best match of the Spanish season, with two fearless sides battling for 120 minutes in a breathtaking derby. 
“It was spectacular, but we don’t enjoy matches like this,” Real manager Carlo Ancelotti told Movistar Plus. “The wear and tear has been tremendous. Because we are two very strong teams who have given everything. We won because we had more energy in the final stages ... [the substitutes] all delivered.” 
Mario Hermoso and Antonio Rudiger exchanged early headed goals before Ferland Mendy sent Madrid ahead at the Al-Awwal Park stadium in Riyadh. 
Antoine Griezmann levelled with a milestone goal for Atletico to become their all-time leading scorer and Kepa Arrizabalaga’s own goal sent the Rojilbancos ahead, but Dani Carvajal smashed Real level and forced extra-time. 
With the game heading towards penalties, Savic’s own goal under pressure from Joselu nudged Real ahead and substitute Diaz wrapped up the win on the counter-attack with Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak stranded out of position. 
In Sunday’s final Real will face either Barcelona or Osasuna. 
Atletico, the only team to beat Real this season, face Real three times in under a month, with their next clash quickly arriving in the Copa del Rey next Thursday. 
“We have a [chance for] revenge and we need our fans behind us in our stadium,” Atletico’s Koke told Movistar. 
However Atletico manager Diego Simeone disagreed with the midfielder. 
“It’s not revenge, in football there is no revenge,” said Simeone. “It’s a new knock-out game that will be different to today. I told my players that I’m really proud of them, they played a great game and we were very close, but it was an unfortunate outcome...”

8,Shaheen’s Pakistan gear up for T20 challenge in New Zealand,Shaheen says Pakistan’s focus will be on producing favourable results in the New Zealand series.,"AUCKLAND: Pakistan under their new captain Shaheen Shah Afridi launch the preparations for this year’s T20 World Cup with a five-match series against New Zealand starting at Eden Park in Auckland on Friday.
Left-arm fast bowler Shaheen was named skipper after Babar Azam stepped down from captaincy in all formats following Pakistan’s disastrous campaign at the ODI World Cup late last year in India.
The ICC T20 World Cup featuring teams from 20 countries will be hosted by the United States and the West Indies from June 1 to 29.
Pakistan, currently fourth in ICC T20 rankings, last played T20 Internationals in April 2023 when they drew a five-game home series against New Zealand 2-2.
Leg-spinner Usama Mir, pacer Mohammad Abbas Afridi and wicket-keeper/batter Haseebullah are the uncapped players in the touring T20 party while Sahibzada Farhan, Azam Khan and Aamer Jamal have returned to the squad.
Shaheen said that Pakistan’s focus would be on producing favourable results in the New Zealand series.
“It is a great honour and a proud moment to be captaining Pakistan. We are a good T20 side and that has reflected in our performances during the past few years. We have done well in World Cups but have not been able to finish [the job] as we wanted. We will focus on getting the results we want in big tournaments,” Shaheen said during a pre-match media conference at on Thursday.
Pakistan won all their first-round games at the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE but lost the semi-final to Australia; they managed to reach the final of the 2022 World Cup in Australia but again fell at the last hurdle as Jos Buttler-led England claimed the coveted title.
Shaheen expects tough going while leading the national team.
“First-time captaincy is not easy, it’s a new challenge in New Zealand,” said the 23-year-old. “However, we have a very good track record against New Zealand but they are one of the best teams in the world so we’ll try to do our best.”
So far, Pakistan have played 15 T20 Internationals on New Zealand soil, winning seven and losing eight. Shaheen and company however can take heart from their 2-1 series win in New Zealand in October 2022, the green-shirts’ last T20 visit to the country.
On the subject of T20 openers, the skipper while acknowledging the role and impact of Babar and Mohammad Rizwan’s pair emphasised the significance of trying different combinations before the World Cup.
“Babar and Rizwan will always be the best opening pair for Pakistan. But, I think we have 17 matches before the [T20] World Cup, and we should try different combinations and try to figure out which player fits in which position and we will try to play them [in that position],” he said.
“We have 17 games before the World Cup. We want to make sure we have our [best] combination locked in time for that but we also want to ensure that we have a strong bench, in case of injuries during the tournament.”
Shaheen continued, “The [team] management will test younger talent and rotate the players so that they have clarity about combination by the time the team play series against England.”
In the four T20s against England before the World Cup, we should know our best playing XI, he underlined.
BABAR TERMED ‘BIG THREAT’
Meanwhile, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson praised the Pakistan team ahead of the series.
Williamson, who led New Zealand to the 2021 T20 World Cup final, stated the matches against Pakistan were always competitive.
“Pakistan are one of the best teams in the world, playing against them is always a fantastic opportunity,” the skipper said during a press conference on Wednesday. “Before the 2022 T20 World Cup, they played a tri-series here [in New Zealand] and won. So we know how strong they are as a team. It will be a great opportunity for our players.”
Williamson conceded that Babar was a major threat for the Black Caps.
“He [Babar] is a world-class player. Cricket comes with a full range of feeling and emotions and part of it is navigating each day and looking to improve. He is one of the best players in the world and I am sure he will be doing that and that doesn’t change overnight. We know he is a big threat,” Williamson insisted.
Squads:
NEW ZEALAND: Kane Williamson (captain), Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wicket-keeper), Tim Seifert (wicket-keeper), Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Adam Milne, Ben Sears, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee
PAKISTAN: Shaheen Shah Afridi (captain), Mohammad Rizwan (vice-captain, wicket-keeper), Aamer Jamal, Abbas Afridi, Azam Khan (wicket-keeper), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Haseebullah (wicket-keeper), Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Usama Mir, Zaman Khan.

MELBOURNE: Serbia’s Novak Djokovic plays cricket during a charity event at Rod Laver Arena on Thursday.—AFP

 
MELBOURNE: Novak Djokovic will begin his quest for a record-extending 11th Australian Open title and 25th Grand Slam crown overall against a qualifier and could meet fellow Grand Slam champion Andy Murray in the third round, while top-ranked Iga Swiatek faces a tricky test against 2020 champion Sofia Kenin, after the draw on Thursday. 
Djokovic required treatment for a wrist problem during his United Cup defeat by Alex de Minaur last week — his first loss in Australia for six years — and can put that disappointment behind him with a fast start at his most successful major. 
The 36-year-old Serb could play Greek seventh seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals in what would be a mouthwatering rematch of last year’s title clash. 
Tsitsipas has a tough task to repeat his 2023 feat with former top 10 Italian Matteo Berrettini his opening opponent, while twice-finalist Daniil Medvedev will start against a qualifier. 
The Russian could face 27th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the third round, with the Canadian facing a stern opening test against former world number three Dominic Thiem. 
Spanish world number two Carlos Alcaraz, the only man to beat Djokovic at a Slam last year to win Wimbledon, gets his campaign under way against French veteran Richard Gasquet. 
The 20-year-old second seed is on course for a quarter-final clash with the rejuvenated Alexander Zverev, who goes up against fellow German Dominik Koepfer. 
Australia’s De Minaur will spearhead local hopes and begins his campaign against Canadian former world number three Milos Raonic. 
Italian youngster Jannik Sinner, who is tipped to go deep at Melbourne Park, will face Botic van de Zandschulp. 
Defending women’s champion Aryna Sabalenka also takes on a qualifier first while 2023 runner-up Elena Rybakina, who downed the world number two in the final of the tune-up tournament in Brisbane, faces former world number one Karolina Pliskova. 
Polish top seed Swiatek will open her account with a blockbuster rematch of the 2020 Roland Garros final that she won against Kenin. 
There will be no let-up for whoever wins, with a second round clash looming against either 2016 Australian Open winner Angelique Kerber or 2022 Melbourne Park finalist Danielle Collins. 
US Open champion Coco Gauff will take on Anna Karolina Schmiedlova, while four-times major winner Naomi Osaka returns to Grand Slam tennis for the first time since 2022 and plays Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia in a tricky opener. 
Osaka, who won the title in 2019 and 2021, only returned to action at Brisbane having spent 15 months on the sidelines and giving birth to her first child in July. 
Wild card Caroline Wozniacki, another former champion and returning mother, will play 20th seed Magda Linette.

The Dakar website reported that the Overdrive Toyota hit a bump or clump of grass and barrel-rolled, suffering heavy damage. 
The car was taken back to the start of the sixth stage with no guarantee of being able to continue on Sunday, the seventh stage after Saturday’s rest day. Al Rajhi had started the day nine minutes and three seconds clear of Qatar’s Al-Attiyah. 
In the motorcycle category, Chilean Honda rider and Wednesday’s stage winner Pablo Quintanilla lost an hour and 40 minutes after running dry before the first refuelling point. 
American Ricky Brabec was in the lead position, two minutes and 48 seconds clear of Botswana’s Ross Branch.

11,Dube fires India to easy T20 victory against Afghanistan,The teams move to Indore for the second T20 of the three-match series on Sunday.,"MOHALI: Shivam Dube proved his utility in India’s crowded batting line-up with a belligerent half-century to secure their six-wicket victory against Afghanistan in the opening T20 International in Mohali on Thursday.
Left-hander Dube gave a good account of himself ahead of the T20 World Cup in June with an unbeaten 60 off 40 balls to help India overcome a 159-run target with 15 balls to spare at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium.
Electing to field, India restricted Afghanistan to a modest 158-5.
Rahmanullah Gurbaz (23) and Ibrahim Zadran (25) put on a 50-run opening partnership but it was Mohammad Nabi’s 42 off 27 balls that helped Afghanistan cross the 150-mark.
Left-arm spinner Axar Patel led India’s disciplined bowling effort, claiming 2-23 in his tidy four overs.
The home side were rattled early in their chase with skipper Rohit Sharma, playing his first T20 International in more than a year, run out for a duck in the first over.
Rohit drove the ball to mid-off and embarked on a quick single but Shubman Gill at the other end was busy watching the ball leading to an mix-up that led to his captain’s dismissal.
Gill struck 23 but was stumped after he came dancing down the track only to miss the delivery from off-spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman.
Tilak Varma (26) combined with Dube in a breezy 44-run stand to steady India but departed after Gulbadin Naib took a blinder at backward square leg.
Jitesh Sharma fell after a quickfire 31 but Dube could not be denied his half-century, which came in 38 balls, and he celebrated the milestone with a monster six before sealing their victory with a four.
The teams move to Indore for the second T20 of the three-match series on Sunday.

12,Shahnaz upbeat about Pakistan’s Olympic prospects,ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan head coach Shahnaz Sheikh is upbeat about the national side’s prospects of ending its ...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan head coach Shahnaz Sheikh is upbeat about the national side’s prospects of ending its Olympic participation drought ahead of the qualifying event for this year’s Paris Games.  
A batch of the team’s contingent, including Shahnaz and assistant coach Shakeel Abbasi, departed for the Oman from here on Thursday after meeting Pakistan Hockey Federation president Tariq Hussain Bugti. The gulf state will host the event from Jan. 15 to 21.
Shahnaz emphasised the significance of Pakistan’s opening match against England and its potential role of setting the team’s momentum in the qualifiers.  “We will make all-out efforts to top our group,” he said. “If we manage to win all three matches, we will qualify for the semi-final against New Zealand, giving us a good chance to move into the final after defeating the Kiwis.” 
The former Olympic gold medalist added that Pakistan aim not only to qualify for this year’s Olympics but also to compete for victory in the showpiece.
Shahnaz said reaching Oman early before the matches was better for adaptation and praised the PHF president for securing funds from the government to ensure the team’s participation in the qualifying event.  
“Without this support, it would have been impossible for the team to participate,” he remarked.
A total of eight teams are participating in the event, divided into two groups. Pakistan are placed with England, Malaysia, and China, while the second group comprises Germany, New Zealand, Canada, and Chile.
Despite boasting three Olympic gold medals, four World Cups, three Asia Cup titles, and eight Asian Games gold medals, along with several other honours, Pakistan unfortunately could not qualify for the last two editions of the Olympics.
AKHTAR DREADS ANOTHER FAILURE
Meanwhile, former Olym­pian and ex-president of the PHF Akhtar Rasool Chau­dhary called upon the Pakis­tan players to give their utmost in the qualifying round
In an exclusive interview with Dawn at Lahore’s National Hockey Stadium on Wednesday, Akhtar stressed the qualifiers were a “golden opportunity” to end the long Olympic drought.
“If Pakistan fails to qualify for the third time, I fear it can be a total disaster for Pakistan hockey,” he feared. 
Akhtar urged the players to focus on their game and disregard the ongoing politics within the PHF. 
As a former captain of Pakistan, part of the winning team in four World Cups (1971, 1975, 1978, and 1982), Akhtar stressed the importance of modern-day fitness standards in hockey. 
“Players should give maximum time to meet international standards by enhancing their fitness levels,” he advised.
Concerned about Pakistan’s recent underperformance on the international stage, Akhtar attributed it to weak fitness levels and called for a collective effort to support the national team. 
“The players need support from all of us, and we should all stand behind them as it is a national cause,” he clarified.

COLOMBO: Sri Lankan leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga made a stunning return to international cricket with a career-best 7-19 to guide his side to an eight-wicket win against Zimbabwe and clinch a 2-0 ODI series win in Colombo on Thursday.
In a game cut to 27 overs a side by two downpours, Sri Lanka’s star bowler, in his first match after a six-month hamstring injury absence, skittled the tourists for just 96.
Sri Lanka knocked off the runs inside 17 overs with Kusal Mendis making an unbeaten 66 from 51 balls.
Zimbabwe had got off to a good start reaching 43 for no loss but the introduction of Hasaranga proved disastrous for the visitors.
Hasaranga’s googly had three wickets by the end of his second over with Zimbabwe slumping to 47-3.
His fourth five-wicket haul is a new record for the R. Premadasa Stadium, eclipsing Angelo Mathews’ 6-20 against India in 2009.
It was also the second best ODI figures by a Sri Lankan bowler behind 8-19 by Chaminda Vaas, also against Zimbabwe in 2001.
Opener Joylord Gumbie top-scored for the visitors with 29.
Skipper Mendis made a 73-run stand for the second wicket alongside debutant She­von Daniel (12) as the hosts cru­ised to a comfortable win with 62 deliveries to spare.

14,Qatar takes centre stage again as 24 nations vie for Asian Cup,The 24 teams spanning Australia to Palestine will battle for regional glory over the next four weeks.,"DOHA: Less than 13 months after hosting one of the all-time great World Cup finals, Qatar takes centre stage once again when 24 nations compete for the AFC Asian Cup in nine stadiums spread across the capital city of Doha.
Twelve years of controversy dogged the World Cup when Qatar were named 2022 hosts as the Muslim Gulf nation denied allegations of abuse of workers, discrimination and bribery to win hosting rights.
Qatar built new stadiums that were written off by critics as a waste of resources for a country with no football culture, with the venues seen as nothing more than potential white elephants.
 
 

But the world took notice when Qatar won their first Asian Cup title in 2019. Although the team failed to deliver at the World Cup, the seeds were sown as the sport grew in popularity.
With China backing out of hosting the 2023 edition due to its ‘zero-COVID’ policy, Qatar — who have hosted the Asian Cup twice before in 1988 and 2011 — took the opportunity with both hands to bring the tournament back to west Asia once again.
“Just over a year ago, Qatar hosted an exceptional World Cup, the first in the Middle East and Arab world, delivering a meaningful and long-lasting legacy,” said Hassan Al Kuwari, the marketing and communications director of the local organising committee. “The Asian Cup builds on this sporting legacy.”
In their bid to become the sporting capital of the world, Gulf states have flexed their financial might by hosting marquee events.
Apart from football, Qatar has hosted major boxing bouts and both the Formula One and MotoGP grands prix, while the 2024 World Aquatics Championships will also be held in Doha next month — another first for a country in the Middle East.
While the 2022 World Cup was not without controversy for the host nation and filled with mounting criticism off the pitch, once the first ball was kicked, the action on the field stole the spotlight.
The tournament defied doubts that the tiny country could host an event on such a grand scale and Qatar will hope the Asian Cup can do the same.
“I’ve participated in Olympic Games, the Euros, the last Asian Cup — you can’t compare this organisation with others. Thanks to Qatar, the country and football federation, for amazing facilities,” said Lebanon coach Miodrag Radulovic.
Although the Asian Cup’s popularity pales in comparison to the World Cup or the Euros, it has a rich history and is the second oldest continental championship in the world after the Copa America.
Qatar won the title in 2019 amid a diplomatic row and political tension in the Gulf. But since the World Cup, those bitter feuds have been set aside.
And from the opening game on Friday where Qatar play Lebanon, the hosts will once again open their arms to an influx of fans from around the region — especially with nearly half the countries in the tournament from the Middle East.
The 24 teams spanning Australia to Palestine will battle for regional glory over the next four weeks, culminating in the final at the 88,000-capacity Lusail Stadium on February 10.
It will take something special to beat the last big game at Lusail — the World Cup final 13 months ago when an Argentina side inspired by Lionel Messi defeated France on penalties.
Qatar won plaudits for its organisation of the World Cup but the team flopped on the pitch, their three straight defeats the worst performance of any World Cup host.
That lingering pain will motivate them in the defence of their Asian crown, but Carlos Queiroz was fired as coach only last month, giving replacement Tintin Marquez little time to prepare.
There are six groups of four, the top two from each reaching the last 16, along with the four best third-placed teams.
Japan, defeated 3-1 by Qatar in the 2019 final in the UAE, look the team to beat and are the most successful side in Asian Cup history with four titles.
Japan have fond memories of Qatar, having stunned Germany and Spain in the group stage of the World Cup before losing to Croatia on penalties in the last 16.
South Korea, Iran, Australia and Saudi Arabia — all of whom played at the 2022 World Cup and are former Asian champions — are also teams to watch.
In Tottenham Hotspur attacker Son Heung-Min, South Korea have the best player in Asia and a world-class performer who is enjoying his football again under Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou.
There will be extra interest in how Saudi Arabia — coached by the Italian Roberto Mancini — get on following an influx of foreign stars into their domestic football led by Cristiano Ronaldo.
The Palestinian team face an uphill task to emerge from a group containing Iran, United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, with their minds on the war in Gaza, in which some players have lost loved ones.
This will be Palestine’s third time at the Asian Cup and they are chasing a first victory after failing to win any of their six matches so far.
