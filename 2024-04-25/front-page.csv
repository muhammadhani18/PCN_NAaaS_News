0,Pleas against military trials ruling become ‘hot potato’,Directions sought for federal govt to place military court orders on record;  Hafeezullah Niazi makes emotional plea for news of son’s whereabouts.,"• SC refers matter back to three-judge panel to form larger bench
• Directions sought for federal govt to place military court orders on record
• AGP says 20 suspects released before Eidul Fitr, counsel contends 85 still in prison
• Hafeezullah Niazi makes emotional plea for news of son’s whereabouts
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday once again referred a set of intra-court appeals (ICAs) back to the three-judge committee against an Oct 23 ruling, which had deemed the trials of civilians in military courts ‘illegal’.
The committee on formation of benches is now expected to form a larger bench to hear the case, as demanded by the counsel of different parties.
The last time this matter was referred to the committee was on Jan 29, when Justice Sardar Tariq Masood — now retired but heading the six-judge bench — acceded to the request of former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja.
Mr Khawaja is one of the parties in the matter and sought the reconstitution of the larger bench, consisting of senior-most judges, to decide appeals in the military court case.
Subsequently, the committee formed the present bench, which consists of Justice Aminud Din Khan, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Azhar Hasan Rizvi, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Musarrat Hilali.
However, on Wednesday, to the bewilderment of some of the family members of the accused facing trial before the military courts who were sitting in Courtroom No. 4, the Supreme Court bench retired for the day with an observation that they were referring the case back to the committee.
This forced TV analyst Hafeezullah Niazi to approach the rostrum with folded hands and plead in a voice filled with emotion. He said he was not concerned whether it was a nine-judge bench or a six-member bench, his concerns were about the safety of his son, Hassan Niazi, who had allegedly gone missing from military custody and had not been heard of for several days now.
“The NAB law is considered draconian for having the provision to detain an acc­used for 90 days, but here our children are in phy­sical remand for the last eight to 10 months,” Mr Nia­zi regretted, saying that he could not sleep in at night since he was a father. “All I want is to become a party in the case,” he pleaded. Justice Moham­mad Ali Mazhar asked Attorney General Mans­oor Usman Awan to look into the matter.
Earlier, senior counsel Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, on behalf of former CJP Jaw­wad S. Khawaja, citing his fresh plea said a larger bench having not fewer than nine judges should be formed to hear the appeals in light of voices from within the SC.
The counsel also cited notes, authored by Jus­t­ices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Yahya Afridi, who had highlighted the need for a larger bench, adding that the potential ramifications demanded high level of judicial scrutiny. He argued that a larger bench would lend credibility to the present appeal process and to any pronouncement on whether civilians could be court-martialled by military courts.
Besides, the larger ben­ch is also necessary in view of any possible split in equal numbers, he said, referring to a letter by incumbent Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to then-Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, highlighting the constitution of a bench comprising junior judges to hear the same matter.
However, Justice Mazhar observed that the notes the counsel was relying on were mere observations, adding that Justice Afridi even joined the court proceedings till the end. Besides, Justice Isa’s letter had no relevance with the present case since it was not a judicial or a binding order.
AGP Awan told the court about the release of 20 people who were arrested for their involvement in the May 9 violence after undergoing the sentence awar­ded so that they could celebrate Eidul Fitr with their families.
At this, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui requested the court to order the federal government to place on record the orders passed by the military trial court for the perusal of the apex court, adding that 85 accused were still under detention and therefore it required urgent hearing into the matter to decide their fate.
Justice Shahid Waheed also observed such orders should be placed before the court so that it could determine whether the requirements of Art­icle 10A, which ensures fair trial, were adhered to while deciding the matter of these individuals.

1,Business leaders in Karachi give PM food for thought,"Premier asked to forge trade ties with India, reconcile with Imran for ""political stability"".","• Premier asked to forge trade ties with India, reconcile with Imran for ‘political stability’
• Industrialists concerned by ‘cross-subsidies’, call for fair energy tariffs
• Warn rising costs would help competitors take over Pakistan’s export orders
KARACHI: As Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sat down with the business community to find ways to uplift the economy through exports, his resolve was met with apprehensions from industry leaders who said it was “almost impossible” to do business under the current circumstances, particularly with high energy costs and inconsistent government policies.
Posing tough questions during an hour-long meeting at the CM House, Karachi’s business community appreciated the PM’s “determination”, but advised him to focus on bringing about political stability to “turn around” the economy.
Appreciating the newly-installed government for moving forward with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that brought some consistency to the money market and contained inflation, they suggested PM Shehbaz initiate trade talks with India and “shake hands” with imprisoned PTI founding chairman Imran Khan — apparently for political stability.
PM Shehbaz, who had arrived in the port city on his maiden visit after his election, said the meeting was an attempt to listen to the “brilliant minds of business, absorb what they say and put it into action” for a comprehensive economic growth roadmap.
“You all are great minds of business… Today we need you to take a step forward and bring this rental business to an end. Let’s focus on genuine industrial and agricultural growth and double the exports in the next five years. It’s difficult but not impossible. It’s an article of faith for me. I would listen to you and make a plan to put that into action.”
In a veiled reference to the booming economy of Bangladesh, he recalled ‘East Pakistan’, which was “once considered” a burden on the country, but had made tremendous strides in industrial growth.
“I was quite young when … we were told that it’s a burden on our shoulders… Today you all know where that ‘burden’ has reached [in terms of economic growth]. And we feel ashamed when we look towards them,” said PM Shehbaz.
Trade ties with India
After the PM’s brief speech, the house was opened for a question and answer session, where business leaders voiced their appreciation for the government’s recent moves, but made more demands.
They also shared proposals for economic policies to achieve desired results.
There was a sense of concern among the business leaders over the political instability in the country for which they even advised the PM to take initiative as the head of the government. “You have made a few handshakes after taking the charge that has produced good results and progress on the IMF deal is one of them,” said Arif Habib, the chief of Arif Habib Group – a capital market giant.
 
 

“I suggest you do a few more handshakes. One of them is regarding trade with India, which would greatly benefit our economy. Secondly, you should also [patch up] with a resident of Adiala Jail (a reference to jailed PTI leader Imran Khan). Try to fix things at that level as well and I believe that you can do it.”
The PM avoided responding directly to the questions aimed at political stability, but claimed to have noted down his proposals for economic growth and assured him that he would soon invite businessmen from all across the country to Islamabad and sit with them “till all the issues aren’t resolved”.
Then came a presentation from Zubair Motiwala, a prominent industrialist and chief of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), who heads the Karachi businessmen’s body called Businessmen Group (BMG).
In his presentation, he questioned the government’s ambitious plan amid the existing business regime. “The prime minister is keen to support the industry by doubling exports and reducing business costs but it seems impossible in the current situation,” said a point of his presentation shared by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI).
“Due to the increasing cost of doing business with these gas and electricity prices, our competitors would soon take us over and get Pakistan’s export orders. It is surprising that we want to increase exports and local manufacturing, but we are increasing energy prices by including cross-subsidies, which has resulted in a gas tariff of Rs2,600 per unit for industrial heating and Rs3,100 per unit for captive power.”
‘Fair gas price’
He referred to the gas prices six months ago when they were charged at Rs1,150 and Rs1,350 per unit respectively and asked “if any business can survive with such an increase in the current international market situation”.
“The industry is willing to pay 100 per cent of the gas price without any subsidy. We don’t want any subsidy. We just want the industry to get a fair gas price,” said Mr Motiwala. In his presentation, he pointed out that the “unnecessary capacity” of power plants had put a burden on Pakistan in the form of capacity charges, resulting in a situation where surplus electricity was neither sold nor provided to industries at lower rates.
“This unnecessary capacity is also increasing the circular debt issue in the power sector. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a scheme to reduce the flat tariff for industrial consumers, which will increase electricity consumption and also help reduce the circular debt issue,” he added.
Earlier, the premier was received by Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, CM Murad Ali Shah, Sindh ministers and senior officials at Karachi airport. The PM also went to the Quaid-i-Azam’s mausoleum to pay his respects.

2,PTI faces yet another challenge to intra-party elections,"Now, the Political Finance Wing of the ECP has asked PTI representatives to appear before the electoral watchdog on April 30.","ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has accepted another plea against the PTI’s intra-party elections, sources told Dawn on Wednesday.
The electoral watchdog seems to be meting out ‘special treatment’ to the party, as it has been issued a notice over alleged irregularities in intra-party polls, conducted on the ECP orders on March 3.
The party had filed documents related to its intra-party polls with the ECP on March 4. The documents, submitted by PTI’s Federal Election Commi­ssioner Raoof Hasan, included details about newly-elected party office-bearers, a certificate of the party chief containing Form 65, names of the core committee members, and other relevant record.
The party, which elected Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Omar Ayub as its chairman and secretary general on March 3, needs the relevant certificate to qualify for the re-allocation of its electoral symbol “bat” by the ECP.
Now, the Political Finance Wing of the ECP has asked PTI representatives to appear before the electoral watchdog on April 30.
This is the third time that the commission has called the legality of PTI’s internal polls into question.
In November 2023, the ECP had annulled the intra-party polls of PTI held in June 2022, giving the former ruling party 20 days to go for a fresh election if it did not want to lose its electoral symbol — bat.
The ECP order came at a time when general elections were about two months away and political parties were ratcheting up their election campaigns across the country.
The PTI, which was al­­r­eady crying foul, had ter­med the ECP ruling an at­­tempt to keep former prime minister Imran Khan and his party away from polls.

3,"Pakistan, Iran agree to boost trade, economic cooperation",ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Iran on Wednesday declared their intention to enhance bilateral trade and collaborate more...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Iran on Wednesday declared their intention to enhance bilateral trade and collaborate more closely in the energy sector, despite US warning Islamabad against engaging with Iranian businesses.
“The two sides agreed to further expand trade and economic cooperation and affirmed their commitment to transform their common border from ‘border of peace’ to a ‘border of prosperity’,” stated a joint communique issued by the neighbouring countries at the end of Iranian President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi’s three-day visit to Pakistan.
Earlier during a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Raisi, the two leaders set a goal to increase bilateral trade to $10 billion over the next five years, up from the current volume of about $2.3bn.
The two countries are aiming to achieve this ambitious target through “setting up of joint border markets, economic free zones, and new border openings”, finalisation of Free Trade Agreement, and operationalising barter trade, according to the communi­que that also underscored the importa­nce of energy sector cooperation thro­ugh electricity trade, installation of power transmission lines and implementation of Iran-Pakistan pipeline project.
However, the US Department of State had on Tuesday issued a warning to the Pakistani government about entering into business deals with Iran. The US threats of sanctions are strategically designed to deter Pakistan from enhancing its economic ties with Iran.
Among other steps for boosting trade and economic cooperation, Pakistan and Iran agreed on early convening of Joint Business Trade Committee and the 22nd round of the negotiations of the Joint Economic Commission (JEC). Exc­h­­ange of economic and technical exp­erts and trade delegations, it was decided, would be facilitated.
“The declaration of ‘Reemdan border point’ as an international border crossing point under TIR and opening of the remaining two border sustenance markets was also agreed,” the communique read.
Pakistan and Iran expressed satisfaction with the progress in goods shipments under the TIR Convention, an international system designed to simplify and speed up road transport across borders. Both countries, it added, agreed on the importance of fully implementing the Convention to enhance efficient, swift, and unrestricted trade between them and to potentially promote regional integration and connectivity across the broader ECO region.
Islamabad and Tehran further agreed to strengthen “mutually beneficial and enduring linkages” between Gwadar and Chahbahar ports.
The two countries pledged to enhance cooperation to address challenges, including terrorism, narcotics, smuggling, and human trafficking.
The communique emphasised the importance of regular exchanges between political, military, and security officials, as well as cooperation through the utilisation of existing bilateral institutional mechanisms for combating terrorism. It stressed adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, particularly respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states while dealing with the terrorism problem.
Both sides advocated for resolving the Kashmir dispute through dialogue and peaceful means that reflect the will of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with international law.
Also, Islamabad and Tehran expre­ssed a forceful condemnation of the ongoing violence by the Israeli regime against Palestinians. They denounced the severe humanitarian impacts resulting from the blockade of Gaza, including extensive casualties and the displacement of millions. They called for an immediate ceasefire, unrestricted humanitarian access to Gaza, the return of displaced Palestinians, and accountability for the crimes committed by the Israeli regime. They reiterated their support for a just, comprehensive, and lasting resolution that aligns with the aspirations of the Palestinians.
Both Pakistan and Iran emphasised the threat that terrorist havens in Afghanistan pose to regional and global security. They expressed a commitment to intensify their collaborative efforts on counter-terrorism and security, aiming to establish a unified stance against terrorism threat from Afghanistan. Additionally, they acknowledged the importance of aligning regional and international initiatives to bolster security and regional stability.

4,Bill to recover Rs2.7tr held up in tax litigation,Wheat policy comes under severe criticism in NA; PTI members stage noisy protest over alleged maltreatment of Bushra Bibi.,"• Wheat policy comes under severe criticism in National Assembly
• PTI members stage noisy protest over alleged maltreatment of Bushra Bibi
• Govt, opposition agree on distribution of standing committees
ISLAMABAD: A day after Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb called for broadening the tax net and expressed concerns over the delay in the cases of tax recoveries, the government on Wednesday tabled a bill in the National Assembly to expedite the process of the recovery of over Rs2 trillion held up in litigation before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR).
The bill, titled Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024 seeking to amend the Sales Tax Act 1990, was laid before the assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on behalf of the finance minister through a supplementary agenda, amid opposition’s call for delaying the move till the formation of the standing committee on finance.
However, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq advised the treasury and the opposition lawmakers to hold informal meetings to discuss the proposed law which would now be laid before the Senate for submitting its recommendations in 10 days.
President Asif Zardari has already summoned the first regular session of the Senate on Thursday.
Besides introduction of the bill, the house witnessed a heated discussion on the issue of the refusal of the government to procure wheat at the announced support price due to the decision of the caretaker government to allow import of the commodity despite expected bumper crop and a noisy protest by the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) members over the alleged maltreatment of Bushra Bibi.
In a significant development, the government and opposition members informed the house that they had reached an understanding on the formula for the distribution of the standing committees and that they would try to finalise the formation of the committees in a meeting on Thursday.
Legislation
Giving salient features of the proposed Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, the law minister said there were pending tax cases amounting to Rs2,700 billion across various appellate forums, including commissioners’ appeals, ATIR and various courts.
Mr Tarar said that presently 72,000 cases were pending at various forums and there were only 20 ATIRs whose number was now being increased to 35 to expedite the process.
The minister said that the government had abdicated many of its powers through the bill and now the prime minister would have no role in the appointment of the ATIR members. These members, equivalent to the high court judges, he said, would be appointed through an open competition and conduction of tests through reputable institutions like IBA, NUST and LUMS.
He said through the proposed legislation, various tax forums had been readjusted keeping in view the amount. He said the cases of tax liabilities up to Rs10 million would continue to be heard by the commissioners whereas the other cases would be referred to the ATIR.
He explained that the duration of the appeal in high courts had been reduced from 90 days to 30 days with the provision that the tax payer would automatically get a stay to prevent immediate withdrawal of the amount from his account. He said the government had made an effort to create a balance so that the rights of the tax payers were protected.
The minister said the bill had been drafted in consultation with the Tax Bar Association and asked the opposition members to give suggestions to improve it.
Standing committees
The members from the treasury and the opposition benches informed the house that they had agreed on the formula for the distribution of the committees and that the process would be completed in another meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday (today).
The issue had been raised by MQM’s Khawaja Izharul Hassan on a point of order in which he had expressed his concerns over the delay in the formation of the committees which, according to him, had started to affect the legislative business of the house.
Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry of the PML-N, who is a part of the process, informed the house that the government had agreed to give chairmanship of 10 standing committees to the opposition. He said that they would soon reach an understanding as to which committees should be handed over to the opposition parties keeping in view the past traditions.
Meanwhile, sources in the government told Dawn that besides chairmanship of 10 committees, the government had also agreed to hand over the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also to the PTI as per the parliamentary tradition, though there was no constitutional bindings.
On the other hand, the National Assembly Secretariat through a statement rebutted reports in some media claiming that the speaker did not want to make PTI’s Sher Afzal Marwat as the PAC chairman. It said that no decision had been made in this regard and traditionally the chairmen of the committees were finalised through consultations between the government and the opposition.
PTI’s protest
Speaking on a point of order, Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub alleged that Bushra Bibi had been poisoned in jail and that the government was hiding the matter through her false medical reports. He demanded that the doctors of Shaukat Khanum Hospital should be provided an access to Bushra Bibi and to conduct the tests.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said that it was on the PTI’s demand that the medical tests of Bushra Bibi were conducted in one of the best private hospitals of Islamabad, instead of any government hospital, adding that there was no reason for referring Bushra Bibi to another hospital of PTI’s choice as all her tests were clear.
Wheat procurement
The NA witnessed a heated debate on points of order on the issue of the wheat procurement, criticising the government for not procuring wheat causing difficulties for the farmers. The issue was raised by PPP’s Nafisa Shah on a point of order.
The members sitting on the opposition as well as treasury expressed their concerns over the government’s refusal to purchase wheat and for allowing import of the commodity despite having a bumper crop.
Opposition’s Sheikh Waqas Akram warned the government that soon the farmers would be in the streets and the rulers would not be able to face the brunt.
Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer admitted that it was the wrong decision of the caretaker government to allow import of the wheat, stating that they would write letters to the provincial governments to procure maximum wheat from the farmers.
