0,US sends arms to Ukraine as Biden signs bill,WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed legislation authorising $61 billion in military aid for...,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed legislation authorising $61 billion in military aid for Ukraine, with the Pentagon quickly announcing a new $1 billion package headed for Kyiv, featuring desperately needed air defence and artillery munitions.
The legislation — which also includes aid for Israel and Taiwan and a potential ban on TikTok — comes after months of delay that saw Ukrainian forces run short of ammunition and suffer battlefield setbacks.
“I just signed into law the national security package that was passed by the House of Representatives this weekend, and by the Senate yesterday,” Biden told reporters, saying he is  “making sure the shipments start right away, in the next few hours.”  “It’s going to make America safer, it’s going to make the world safter and it continues American leadership in the world and everyone knows it,” he said of the legislation.
“It gives vital support to America’s partners so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty and to the lives and freedoms of their citizens.” 
The Pentagon quickly announced a $1 billion package for Kyiv using the new funding, including air defence munitions, artillery rounds, ammunition for HIMARS precision rocket launchers, anti-tank weapons and armored vehicles.
The aid legislation — valued at a total of $95 billion — only passed the House of Representatives after months of acrimonious debate among lawmakers over how or even whether to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, which it launched in February 2022.
A similar aid package passed the Senate in February, but had been stalled in the House while Republican Speaker Mike Johnson — heeding calls from ex-president Donald Trump and his hardline allies — demanded concessions from Biden on immigration policies, before a sudden reversal.

1,Taliban govt joins climate change talks for first time,Afghanistan ranked as one of the countries least prepared to tackle the effects of climate change.,"KABUL: The Taliban government has entered the first stage of discussions with the United Nations, donors and non-governmental organisations, over the impact of climate change in Afghanistan, organisers said on Wednesday.
After four decades of war, Afghanistan is ranked as one of the countries least prepared to tackle the effects of climate change that are spurring extreme weather conditions and warping natural environments.
Foreign aid to Afghanistan has dwindled since the Taliban takeover, in 2021. Donors are wary of backing a government that is commonly considered a pariah, leaving poor and climate-vulnerable communities, further exposed to the detrimental effects.
The Norwegian Afghanistan Committee (NAC), co-hosted three days of talks that came to a close on Tuesday, country director Terje Watterdal told reporters at a news conference in Kabul.
He said it was the first occasion where Taliban officials “joined a parallel session, face-to-face and online, with a broad range of their counterparts in the West, since the change of government in August 2021”.
The talks included universities, diplomats, UN agencies, donors and grassroots members of Afghan society. All sides agreed that “both individual and collective action is required both inside and outside of Afghanistan”, Watterdal said.
“All government ministries committed their full support for the national and international organizations working to combat climate change and reduce the impact of climate change in Afghanistan.”Watterdal said it is “necessary to de-politicise key development issues, such as climate change”.

2,4 injured as cavalry horses run amok in London,Medical authorities say four people had been taken to hospital after being injured.,"LONDON: A number of military horses, including one covered in blood, ran amok on the streets of central London and injured at least four people on Wednesday.
The horses belong to the Household Cavalry, which acts as the British  monarch’s official bodyguard and takes part in ceremonial duties. They  are garrisoned at Hyde Park barracks, less than a mile away from  Buckingham Palace.
The bizarre scenes unfolded in the heart of London, near Buckingham Palace and the seat of the British government, with the runaway animals galloping past bewildered Londoners going about their morning commute.
“A number of military working horses became loose during a routine exercise this morning. All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp,” a British army spokesperson said in a statement.
“A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.”  Medical authorities said four people had been taken to hospital after being injured.
Television images showed one saddled white horse seemingly covered in blood running through the street alongside another, black one.

3,US TikTok bill sets up fight over free speech,"The proposal has alarms civil rights advocates, TikTok and users of the app","WASHINGTON: The US Senate set up a likely court showdown over the scope of TikTok’s free speech protections under the US Constitution when it  approved a bill on Tuesday  to ban the social media platform from app stores unless its Chinese owner sells it.
While the bill itself does not say anything about speech, the proposal has alarmed civil rights advocates, TikTok and users of the app, all of whom could sue if President Joe Biden signs it into law  as expected.
Legal experts said opponents of the law could argue it infringes free speech by preventing users from expressing themselves and businesses from using the app to promote products. TikTok has already beaten a similar attempt to ban its use in the US state of Montana, although the state is appealing that ruling.
Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, called the US legislative effort  “censorship plain and simple” in a letter that his group and others sent to lawmakers in March.
A court that agrees with that assessment would apply strict scrutiny, meaning the government would have to prove it has not violated speech rights under the Constitution’s First Amendment and that there are no lesser ways to achieve the government’s national security goals.
The bill’s promoters have argued it has nothing to do with speech but merely regulates a commercial activity by requiring TikTok’s Beijing-based owner ByteDance to sell the US operations within about a year, denying China easy access to users’ data.
The bill sets the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit as the venue for any legal challenges. TikTok could ask the court to preliminarily bar enforcement of the law while it pursues a case contending the measure is unlawful and should be struck down.
Legal experts said if the government winds up fighting a First Amendment case under the strict scrutiny standard, it must prove national security or some other compelling government interest is at stake. It will also have to prove the law was  “narrowly tailored” to address that particular issue.
Critics spot a weakness in the government’s potential case on this point: Washington thus far has seemed unconcerned about abuse of users’ data by other social media platforms.
Plenty of companies such as Meta Platforms’ Facebook collect, store and share users’ data, but the government has never treated that activity as a national security threat or enacted data protections.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s David Greene said that if the US were really concerned about China and data privacy, it would push legislation that applies to all social media companies, not just TikTok.
The government would need to convince a court the measure is not a limitation on speech but a regulation of a commercial transaction and a way to protect national security.
The government would argue that TikTok could continue to operate and US users continue to use it, just not under Chinese ownership, so the law’s effect on speech was  “incidental” and permitted.
In November, a US federal judge in Montana blocked Montana’s effort to ban TikTok within the state. TikTok and some users filed a pair of First Amendment lawsuits challenging the proposed ban, which had been set to take effect in January.

4,Iraq hangs 11 convicted of ‘terrorism’,"Under Iraqi law, terrorism and murder offences are punishable by death.","NASIRIYAH: Iraqi authorities executed 11 people convicted of “terrorism” this week, security and health sources said on Wednesday, with rights group Amnesty International condemning an “alarming lack of transparency”.
Under Iraqi law, terrorism and murder offences are punishable by death, and execution decrees must be signed by the president.
A security source in southern Dhi Qar province said that 11 “terrorists from the Islamic State group” were executed by hanging at a prison in the city of Nasiriyah, “under the supervision of a justice ministry team”.
A local medical source confirmed that the health department had received the bodies of 11 executed people. They were hanged on Monday “under an anti-terrorism law”, the source added.
All 11 were from Salahaddin province and the bodies of seven had been returned to their families, the medical official said.
Iraqi courts have handed down hundreds of death and life sentences in recent years for people convicted of membership in “a terrorist group”, an offence that carries the death penalty regardless of whether the defendant had been an active fighter.
Iraq has been criticised for trials denounced by rights groups as hasty, with confessions sometimes said to have been obtained under torture.

5,"Post-World War II order on ‘brink of collapse’, says Amnesty",US accused of shielding Israeli authorities against scrutiny for multiple rights violations in Gaza.,"LONDON: The Amnesty International on Wednesday  stated that the post-World War II order, was on the “brink of collapse”. It said that bitter conflicts on multiple fronts due to the rapid and unregulated rise of artificial intelligence, are also ‘threatening’.
“Everything we’re witnessing over the last 12 months is indicating that the international global system is on the brink of collapse,” Amnesty’s secretary general, Agnes Callamard told reporters. She issued these remarks as the group released its annual, “State of the World’s Human Rights” report.
“In particular, over the last six months, the United States has shielded and protected the Israeli authorities against scrutiny for the multiple violations committed in Gaza,” she said.
“By using its veto against a much-needed ceasefire, the United States has emptied out the (United Nations) Security Council of what it should be doing.”

US accused of shielding Israeli authorities against scrutiny for multiple rights violations in Gaza

Israel’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip has killed 34,183 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
The global rights body termed that Hamas carried out “horrific crimes” on Israeli communities bordering Gaza but that Israel had responded with “a campaign of collective punishment”.
“It is a campaign of deliberate, indiscriminate bombings of civilians and civilian infrastructure, of denial of humanitarian assistance and an engineered famine,” Callamard wrote in her foreword to the report.
“For millions the world over, Gaza now symbolises utter moral failure by many of the architects of the post-World War Two system,” she said.
Israel’s allies, including those who provide them with arms and ammunition, were complicit, she said. She went to deplore ‘a lack of action’ by international institutions and questioned whether postwar ideals of “never again”, had faded away.
AI threat
“Powerful actors” which include Russia and China, are “demonstrating a willingness to put at risk the entirety of the 1948 rule-based order” Callamard warned.
The report documented “flagrant rule-breaking by Russian forces during their continued full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the use of torture or other ill-treatment against prisoners of war”.
The rights group said that Beijing, too, had acted in contravention to international law, “by protecting the Myanmar military”, despite its attacks against civilians. “Urgent measures” were required “to revitalise and renew the international institutions intended to safeguard humanity” Callamard said.
“What we are calling for is an urgent reform of the UN Security Council, in particular reform on the right of veto so that it cannot be used in situations of massive human rights violations,” she told members of the press.
The rise of AI is also concerning. The report found that AI is, “enabling pervasive erosion of rights, perpetuating racist policies” and “enabling spreading misinformation.”

6,Klimt’s Portrait of Miss Lieser fetches $32m at auction,The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades.,"VIENNA: Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Miss Lieser, a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, sold at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros ($32m) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
The painting was commissioned by brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser, who were industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire. They had built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to auction house Im Kinsky, which put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30m to 50m euros.
It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who Fraeulein Lieser actually was. Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed Lilly, was married to Justus, one of the two industrialist brothers, until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. 
It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
“According to the latest provenance research, Klimt’s model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser’s niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger,” the auction house said on its website.

7,Spanish PM suspends duties after court probe against wife,Sanchez say the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response.,"MADRID: Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he would suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife’s private dealings.
Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on April 29 to announce his decision.
“I need to pause and think,” he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. “I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour.”  
The shock announcement came after a court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez’s wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.
Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.
The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), whose leader has links to the far-right.
Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course that she ran.
Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the Peoples Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had “collaborated” with those circulating the claims against his wife.
His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: “We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this.”
