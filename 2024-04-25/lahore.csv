Azmat Bibi, 60, of Mandi Bahauddin district, who was seriously injured in the incident, later succumbed to her injuries. Her body was moved to her native village.
The injured persons include Rizwana of Lalamusa, Allah Ditta of Wazirabad, Saleem Akhtar of Thimka near Jalalpur Jattan, Umar Siddique of Gujranwala, Khalida Parveen and Gulshan of Gujrat and Siddique of Mandi Bahauddin.
The incident allegedly occurred due to the negligence of the government engineers and contractor firm, as well as the hospital’s administration, since the civil work was underway at the facility in connection with the Punjab government’s project to revamp the hospital’s old building.
Rescue 1122 officials and local authorities say the roofs of ground and first flours of the old building had bent because of removal of the support pillars to replace the windows of the surgical ward.
On being informed of the incident, Rescue 1122 teams, volunteers of Alkhidmat Foundation and officials of district administration and police reached the scene and joined the rescue operation.
Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Safdar Virk told Dawn after a detailed visit to the collapsed portion of the building that luckily the roof did not collapse totally, otherwise, it could have been more disastrous.
He says that when the beam collapsed there were only eight to 10 persons in the female surgical ward, while the ward on the ground floor had already been vacated.
The DC says that the Punjab government has taken a serious notice of the incident and constituted a committee to probe into it and fix the responsibility. A strict action may be taken against those found guilty in the light of inquiry report, he adds.
Those injured in the incident have been shifted to Rasheeda Shafi Trauma Centre at the ABSTH, where their condition is said to be stable, hospital sources say. They say that four other persons who suffered minor injuries in the incident have been discharged after provision of first aid.
Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique, Minister for Communication and Works Sohaib Bharth, along with the provincial secretaries of their respective departments, also reached the ABSTH and inspected the site.
They also inquired after the injured persons and assured them of treatment facilities.
The health minister says the Punjab government has ordered an inquiry into the incident and a committee has been constituted in this regard, whereas the C&W department officials will also prepare a report.
In a statement at night, Kh Salman Rafique said the provincial government has removed MS Dr Asif Mahmood and buildings executive engineer. He said the contractor would also face action.
Earlier, the Gujrat DC sent an initial report of the incident to the provincial government.

3,Man and his son among five workers succumb to burns,Seven others injured in April 20 boiler blast at textile unit critical.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: Five out of the 12 workers, including a 12-year-old boy, who had suffered burns in a steam boiler explosion in a textile mills located on Sargodha Road near motorway M-4 at Faisalabad on April 20, succumbed to their injuries on Tuesday night and Wednesday.
The deceased workers include a minor boy Salman (12), his father Fayyaz (40), residents of Bahawalnagar, Waseem (18) and Mustansar (24), both of Arifwala and Zunair (26) of Samundri. Seven other workers injured in the incident are still in serious condition in the burns unit of the Allied Hospital.
Reacting to the incident, Labour Qaumi Movement (LQM) Chairman Baba Latif Ansari at a press conference on Wednesday, especially lamented death of the underage worker, Salman, saying it has exposed the blatant use of child labour in the textile industry.
He said health and safety measures were not being adopted in the industry and  children were being used as labourers due to negligence of the labour welfare  department officials.

Seven others injured in April 20 boiler blast at textile unit critical

Ansari quoted a labour department official as saying that child labour was common in the local textile industry.
The LQM leader alleged that to conceal the use of child labour in the textile unit where the blast occurred, the injured boy was admitted to the district headquarters (DHQ) hospital, instead of the Allied Hospital’s burns unit.
He also alleged that as the DHQ hospital had no burns unit, the boy succumbed to his injuries for lack of proper treatment, while his father Fayyaz. died at the Allied Hospital.
Demanding stern action against the millers who failed to ensure health and safety measures for workers, he urged Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to order payment of ample compensation amounts to the heirs of five deceased  workers of Sargodha mills, besides to the families of four other workers who had burnt alive in a fire incident last month in a textile mills.
He also demanded compensation for another worker who was burnt alive after falling into a furnace at a  bricks kiln at Faisalabad recently.
Ansari also alleged that to avoid high cost of gas, many textile mills were using hazardous materials, including used clothes, remains of corn crop, wheat husk etc to heat boilers, putting at risk health and safety of 1.4 million workers employed in the sector.
He announced if the demands were not accepted, workers would stage a protest demo outside the Faisalabad DC office on May 1.
Meanwhile, the CM directed the authorities concerned to get the   standard operating procedures (SOPs) strictly implemented to ensure   workers’ safety.
Expressing grief and sorrow over the loss of   precious human lives due to a boiler explosion in Faisalabad, she said:   “Action should be taken against all those factory owners who do not   follow workers’ safety guidelines.”
She ordered an inquiry into the  incident, and sought a report from the Faisalabad commissioner in this  regard.
GIRL RAPED: A minor girl was allegedly rapedby a youth  in Kot Bahadur locality of Jhang on Wednesday.
Athara Hazari police claimed to have arrested the accused, who allegedly lured the nine-year-old girl to a house and raped her.
Jhang District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Rashid Hidayat visited the DHQ hospital and inquired after the girl. He assured her parents that justice will be provided to them.

4,"Minister says solution being worked out: Treasury, Opp urge govt to stop wheat price crash",MPAs seek probe into import by caretakers when enough grain was in stocks,"LAHORE: In a rare show of unity, both treasury and opposition benches in the Punjab Assembly joined their voices on Wednesday to draw government’s attention towards the plight of wheat growers.
When the issue of extremely low prices of the new wheat crop in the market was raised, most of the MPAs from across the aisle came on the same page as Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan also supported the cause.
Mr Khan said ministers concerned should meet the chief minister to come up with a wheat procurement policy.
The assembly session started with a usual delay of one hour and 45 minutes. At the beginning of the proceedings, opposition MPA Rana Shehbaz lamented that wheat growers were being offered very low price in the market and claimed that middlemen were offering growers just Rs2,800 per 40kg against the minimum support price of Rs3,900.

MPAs seek probe into import by caretakers when enough grain was in stocks

Agriculture minister Ashiq Kirmani held the caretaker government responsible for the situation, claiming the caretakers had imported wheat unnecessarily when the province had enough grain in its stock. He said that a solution was being worked out in consultation with the food department.
The speaker urged them to meet the chief minister for bringing a clear wheat policy as the farmers of Punjab were worried.
Opposition leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar said farmers owning up to 12 acres of land had sold their grain at throwaway prices to the middleman.
Treasury member Iftikhar Chhachhar regretted that the food department could not so far appoint staff at the wheat procurement centres, and demanded forming a committee comprising MPAs and government officials to resolve the issue.
Sardar Muhammad Khan said that the government was determined to `eliminate’ farmers.
Criticising the government’s wheat policy, the MPAs demanded an investigation into the import of wheat by the caretaker government.
The speaker announced that the house would discuss wheat and agriculture issues in its sitting on Thursday (today).

6,Guardrooms outside residences of bureaucrats removed,LHC registrar is yet to respond to govt letter for such action outside houses of 17 judges,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Wednesday removed guardrooms constructed in the open green areas in front of bureaucrats’ residences in the GOR-I only after the observation made by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa.  
The Punjab government had immediately responded to the chief justice’s call and even sought the Lahore High Court registrar’s nod for the removal of the guardrooms/ check posts constructed outside 17 judges’ residences – but there seems no response yet.  
The CJP had stayed at the Chief Justice’s Rest House in the GOR-1 last week and had expressed his concern over the “change of character of the GOR-1 for worse” as he saw several guardrooms constructed in the open green areas in front of various residences. “If a guard is required, he should be within the premises of the residence of the person to be guarded,” the chief justice had stated in a Supreme Court’s letter by its registrar to the Punjab chief secretary. “Is it justifiable to spend public resources on walls within the secured GOR,” the registrar asked on behalf of Mr Isa.
Sources in the Punjab government say the bureaucracy could wake up from slumber only on the instructions of the CJP while it remained always on its toes to remove encroachments created outside private residences or lift the structures and merchandise of vendors from roadsides in the city.

LHC registrar is yet to respond to govt letter for such action outside houses of 17 judges

Since the SC registrar had asked the Punjab chief secretary to furnish the applicable rules/ regulations in respect of buildings and construction, including walls, within the GOR, the Punjab government thought it better to go fast and remove structures – constructed years and years ago.
Sources in the Punjab government say such structures were also present in the GOR-II and GOR-III and the residents are awaiting removal of those structures and tents outside different bureaucrats and police officers’ residences.Though some bureaucrats say the CJP should have also sent a similar letter to the Lahore High Court chief justice to order the removal of the illegal structures outside judges’ residences, the Punjab government had immediately written a letter to the LHC registrar seeking removal of the guardrooms/ check posts constructed outside residences of 17 judges. The GOR-1 residences occupied by the LHC judges that also have guardrooms/check posts on open green areas are: 19-Aikman Road; 1-A, 1-B, 2, 4, 10 and 12 Tollinton Road; 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 Tollinton Lane; 8-B, 12-B, 14-B and 15-B Golf Road; and 1-D Club Road. 
The S&GAD had requested the LHC registrar to make necessary arrangements vis-à-vis removal of the structures or move them inside the residences.
When contacted, an LHC official privy to the developments told Dawn that the court was currently consulting the security agencies and police ahead of removing the guardrooms to ensure security of the judges. “The judges are facing security threats and it is necessary to make alternate arrangements before implementing the CJP’s direction,” the official stated.  
When contacted, additional secretary (welfare) retired Capt Muhammad Waseem remained tight-lipped over the demolition of guardrooms outside bureaucrats’ residences as well as whether the government was planning to launch a similar operation in the GOR-II and III or not.

Ehsanullah Virk challenged the ECP proceedings on an application for recount by Zulfiqar Ali Bhindar, the runner-up candidate of the PML-N, in NA-79, Gujranwala, and Dr Azeemuddin Zahid Lakhvi assailed the recounting plea in NA-133, Kasur.
Virk said the ECP declared him successful in the Feb 8 election as he secured 104,023 votes. He said the respondent, Bhinder, came second with 99,635 votes.
Lakhvi contended that he defeated the respondent runner-up candidate, Rana Muhammad Ishaq Khan of the PML-N, with a margin of 10,757 votes. He said the respondent filed an application to the ECP requesting a recount in the constituency and the commission also issued him (the petitioner) notices.
Lawyers for both petitioners mainly argued that the commission could not intervene in the matter relating to the results after the completion of the election process.
They said in both cases, the applications for the recount were filed after the issuance of the gazette notifications of the petitioners’ victory.
Furthermore, they said the election tribunals had also been formed to hear the election petitions when the commission entertained the applications for the recount and issued notices to the petitioners.
They asked the court to set aside the impugned notices for being unlawful.
Allowing the petitions, Justice Shahid Karim observed that the decisions being made by the ECP were not commendable. He said it needed to be clarified why all this was happening in Gujranwala. He said the election commission is a constitutional institution and the court does not want to interfere in its matter.
“It is better for the election commission to make decisions itself, otherwise, the court will give its decision,” Justice Karim observed.
The judge set aside the impugned notices by the ECP issued to the petitioners.
Last week, Justice Karim also struck down a decision of the ECP for a recount in NA-81 of Gujranwala.
The judge ruled that the election commission cannot review its decisions after the declaration of results by it.

The farmers chanted slogans condemning the Punjab government’s inaction in purchasing wheat from them.
They criticised both the Punjab government and the agriculture department for failing to enforce the wheat support price in the open market. Farmers lamented that wheat was being sold by them at rates ranging from Rs2,800 to Rs3,000. PKI Punjab President Muhammad Hussain led the protest.  
The protesters presented four demands: ensuring wheat purchase at the government-announced support price of Rs3,900, strict enforcement and legal action against commission agents and brokers at Ghala Mandi purchasing wheat below the official rate, announcement of schedules by Passco and the provincial food department for the distribution of gunny bags and wheat purchase, and a change in the ongoing provincial policy by eliminating the requirement of six gunny bags per six acres of land.  
Muhammad Hussain, speaking to Dawn, criticised Passco officials in Pakpattan district for allegedly selling gunny bags to commission agents through forgery in Gardawari records instead of genuine farmers.
Mr Hussain strongly condemned the Punjab government’s wheat import policy, arguing that the import of 3.2 million tonnes of wheat had harmed the interests of local farmers. He accused the government of not being willing to purchase wheat at its own rate, leaving farmers at the mercy of commission agents and open markets where they were forced to sell their crops at very low prices.
The farmers demanded that if the government cannot enforce its own support price, it should regulate the local market and take legal action against those involved in purchasing wheat at below-market prices.
Dawn learnt from sources that Deputy Commissioner Ikramul Haq was transferred today (Wednesday), so negotiations with farmers were conducted by additional DC Mr. Marth along with AC revenue Usman. They assured farmers that their demands would be forwarded to the provincial chief secretary.
Food Deputy Director Imran Munir said the department had received 50,000 applications through the Punjab government app from Sahiwal district. However, he stated the government had not yet announced schedules for the distribution of gunny bags and wheat purchase targets in Sahiwal division.
