Under the plans okayed by the cabinet in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur here on Tuesday, 600,000 metric tons of wheat will be procured at the rate of Rs3,900 for 40kg.
The cabinet directed authorities to ensure the quality and quantity of wheat and the transparency of its procurement, according to an official statement issued on Wednesday.

The unification was proposed by a working group set up by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) for SEZs and headed by the chairman of the Privatisation Commission.
After approval, the NIDRA will, under the executive and legislative authority, assume all roles to the extent of zones required to establish, regulate, develop, operate, and manage them under the NIDRA law, according to the official statement.
It added that all the roles of the federal entities would be shifted to the NIDRA.
“Though almost all the above entities were originally established under federal legislation, the present approval was given with the condition that the incentives extended under the SEZ, EPZ and STZA should be brought under the umbrella of a single organisation to facilitate investors.”
The statement added that operations, management, administrative control of the zones, and industrial estate should remain with the provinces for better facilitation of investors.
The cabinet also approved the rehabilitation and restoration of the 17 megawatt Ranolia hydropower project in Lower Kohistan at a cost of Rs8.1 billion.

4,PHC rejects plea to implead Peshawar civic agency in BRT inquiry case,"Observes if PDA has issues with NAB probe, it should move court itself","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday rejected a petition for including the Peshawar Development Authority as a respondent in the petition against a National Accountability Bureau inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the Bus Rapid Transit project.
A bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah observed that if the PDA had any issues with the NAB probe, the court should be approached by it and not project contractors.
The petition was filed last year by Ch. A. Latif and Sons Limited (Calsons), which was part of a joint venture of contractors awarded the project, through directors Chaudhry Imran Latif and Amir Latif against the NAB inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the BRT project.
The court granted the two directors interim relief last year by directing the NAB to continue with the inquiry without arresting them.

Observes if PDA has issues with NAB probe, it should move court itself

The petitioners filed an application requesting the court to include the PDA as a respondent in the petition, insisting the civic agency is a necessary party to the BRT controversy because it is the executing agency of the project.
Justice Sahibzada Asadullah wondered how PDA could be made party to the petition when it didn’t approach the court.
The counsel for the petitioners said the PDA had issued different documents to his clients, and therefore, it was necessary to hear their point of view on the matter.
He said certain documents were required in the case, and they’re in the possession of the PDA.
The lawyer said the main petition challenged the NAB’s inquiry.
The bench wondered whether an inquiry could be challenged when no final order had so far been made in it.
NAB deputy prosecutor general Mohammad Ali argued that the application was meant to further delay the matter.
He said an interim relief was granted to the petitioners many months ago, and they wanted to further prolong it.
Mr Ali argued that when the PDA had not approached the high court to seek any relief, then how the petitioners could file an application for impleading it as the respondent in the case.
He pointed out that the main petition was fixed for hearing on May 23, and over an application from the bureau for an early hearing, it was fixed for May 2.
The NA deputy prosecutor said the application was filed by the petitioners to further delay proceedings.
He argued that if the petitioners considered that the PDA had certain proofs in their favour, they should produce the same during trial instead of requesting to make it party to the petition.
Mr Ali argued that it had yet to be decided whether the petition was maintainable or not.
He added that the court had to decide whether it could interfere in the matter at the stage of inquiry or not.
In the main petition, the Calsons directors requested that the court declare that the NAB has no authority or mandate to hold an inquiry or investigation into the matters of the BRT project and harass them.
They prayed the court to declare illegal the proceedings initiated by the NAB, including the inquiry and call-up notices against them.
The petitioners contended that the disputes, if any, arising out of the BRT contracts were required to be adjudicated by and decided through a three-tier redressal mechanism, including a dispute board, as per the contract agreements, and the NAB had no right to influence or cause impediment in the process of that mechanism.

10,Rain damage assessment process  criticised,CHITRAL: Members of the tehsil council Chitral resented the process of damage assessment after the recent widespread...,"CHITRAL: Members of the tehsil council Chitral resented the process of damage assessment after the recent widespread rains and flayed the district administration for excluding the village council’s chairmen from the process.
In the session of the council held here on Wednesday with Fakhre Azam in the chair, the members unanimously demanded the government make the assessment process inclusive and transparent to ensure that not a single affected family is registered for compensation.
They included chairman Shahzada Amanur Rehman, Sajjad Ahmed Khan, Mohammad Rehman, Nawab Khan, Sharaf Din, Abdul Haq and Aminur Rehman.
They alleged that the ongoing process of damage survey and assessment was highly polarised and selective on political basis while really deserving families losing their houses to the incessant rains that raged the valley incessantly for three days.
They insisted that more than 80 per cent of the affected families had yet to be surveyed and their damages assessed specially in the far-flung areas of Lot Koh which consisted of 13 villages out of which only one had been surveyed.
The members flayed Lower Chitral’s DC for ignoring the unanimous request of the house to extend the last date of survey and assessment of the damages by 24th April and said that closing the process so premature meant deprivation of devastated families from compensation.
The members demanded necessary powers and funds for themselves for the accountability of government officers.
The session was later adjourned to meet again on Thursday to have a detailed discussion on the payment of compensation to the rain-affected people in Chitral.
FESTIVAL: The four-day Kagh Lusht festival will begin on May 1 in Upper Chitral instead of April 25 due to the forecast of rains in the valley for three days.
Upper Chitral DC Mohammad Irfanuddin told Dawn that the events of the festival won’t be affected by the change in the date of its commencement.
He said the event attracted a large number of tourists from all parts of Chitral, which provided an opportunity of festivity to the residents after an extended winter season of four months and was second to the Shandur Festival.

11,Dir police continue search for ‘missing’ Saudi woman,LOWER DIR: The police are continuing search for a Saudi Arabian woman and her Pakistani driver after both went...,"LOWER DIR: The police are continuing search for a Saudi Arabian woman and her Pakistani driver after both went missing earlier this month. 
The woman, Hanan Abdullah, 37, was serving as a bank officer in the Saudi Arabia, while the man, Abdul Ahad, 22,  from Lower Dir worked as her driver, local sources said.
The man is already married and has a daughter too, according to his family sources. The news spread like a forest fire when it was circulated on the social media platforms.  
Some sources said the Saudi ambassador even talked to Prime Minister Mian Shahbaz Sharif who directed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inspector general of police to immediately recover the woman.
According to official sources the Islamabad police had registered a case of kidnapping the woman against the driver, Abdul Ahad, on April 18. A team of Islamabad police in this regard reached the Lower Dir to recover the woman.  
A police raiding team led by acting district police officer Rashid Khan along with DSP Iqbal Khan and a heavy contingent of police raided the Khararai village here the other day. The officials also met the area elders and asked for their cooperation in the safe recovery of the Saudi woman. Several members of Ahad’s family were also taken into custody and interrogated.
The couple, according to the family members, had been in hiding for the last several days. “We, definitely, would have handed the couple over to police if we knew their whereabouts,” a relative told the raiding team.
The Lower Dir police continued its search to recover the couple in parts of the Khall tehsil for the second consecutive day here on Wednesday but to no avail.  
According to sources privy to the development the Saudi woman had fallen in love with her Pakistani driver and she reached the Lower Dir district on April 3 to meet her friend.
Meanwhile a local resident, while requesting not to be named, told Dawn that the couple had entered a marriage and nikah had been solemnised by a religious cleric. However, the Lower Dir police denied any such report and said the couple had not appeared so far in any court for a legal marriage.
According to unconfirmed reports, the couple was recovered by Islamabad police from Karachi on Wednesday.

12,"Reading termed vital for progress, promoting critical thinking","Literary bodies, printers observe world book day","PESHAWAR: Literary organisations, local publication houses and printers observed World Book and Copyright Day to acknowledge the influence of books on both individuals and societies at large.
Experts believe that reading promotes critical thinking, widen scope of mental capability and help in enriching pluralistic approach towards building a progressive, peaceful and tolerant society.
Poets and writers took to the social media and shared their views regarding the importance of reading and its role in shaping societies. Research scholars and bibliophiles stressed the need for developing a taste for reading among youth to sharpen their critical thinking.
Pohantun Adabi Stori, (PAS) a literary body of university graduates, Sahu Leekunkio Adabi Maraka, Halqa-i-Arbab Zauq, Bazme Bahar-i-Adabi and several other literary associations and rights activists organised events to mark the day and help youth to revive habit of book reading.

Literary bodies, printers observe world book day

Mohammad Haris Karim Khan, chief of Peshawar Circles, a forum of college students, told this scribe that their organisation recently arranged its 41th monthly study circle where more than 200 students turned up and showed keen interest in the event . He added that the trend of reading books on variety of topics and issues had arisen over the last three years.
Prof Abaseen Yousafzai, the patron-in-chief of PAS, stated that it was a good sign that young people were turning to reading books on issues both local and global but still a large number of school going students remained sticking to their mobile phones and most were involved in negative use of social media platforms.
Prof Nasir Ali Syed, a senior writer, said that too much dependency on social media kept youth away from serious reading. He said that parents and teachers should encourage children to understand the significance of reading, especially books outside their course.
Abdur Rahman Afridi, an activist of Dosti Welfare Organisation (DWO), told this scribe that his organisation held several events since the start of the year and it gave them a spirit to organise such literary festival across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Prof Inayatullah Khan, an avid reader, said that reading books could help in reshaping societies and refine people’s approach to respecting other’s opinions and believes. He said that advanced countries invested in books not in weapons, built schools not garment markets. “Even teachers spend no money on purchasing books. Writers gift their books while students turn their backs on books,” he added.
He said that without reading books, no talent could come up and dream of progress would remain a far-fetched target. “Literary festivals inspire youth to read books on wide range of topics to build a worldview and promote critical thinking for better understating of local and global issues,” he said.
Mamoonur Rasheed, a student of English literature at National University of Modern Languages (NUML) Peshawar campus said that students at school level were not encouraged to read books outside their syllabus that’s why cheating in examinations at even higher level continued, corrupting the minds of youth.
