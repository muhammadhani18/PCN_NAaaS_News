0,Sewerage project faces scrutiny,Record sought of bidding for Jaranwala sewerage system project,"Punjab Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) has summoned the Jaranwala municipal committee administrator along with the relevant record after the disqualification of four construction firms from procurement for sub-projects of improvement of the sewerage system and construction of a wastewater treatment plant costing Rs1.2 billion.
The project is being funded by the World Bank.
According to sources, the municipal committee had called tenders for the projects, advising the contractor firms to submit the technical and financial bids simultaneously.
While opening the technical bids, only one firm was declared qualified while the others were declared disqualified, following which they filed petitions in lower and the high court. They also appealed to the Anti- Corruption Establishment, Punjab Municipal Development Fund Company (PMDFC), the deputy commissioner of Faisalabad and the procurement regulatory authority to cancel the procurement process and initiate the tendering anew.
The DC referred the matter to a grievances redress committee, following which another firm was declared qualified for the bidding.
To ascertain the facts behind the disqualification of contractors, the municipal committee was ordered to constitute a panel to investigate and decide upon the complaints within 15 days.
Meanwhile, the PMDFC, a subsidiary of the Punjab Local Government Department has sent a letter to the chief officer of the municipal committee,stating that upon the evaluation of technical bids conducted by the consultant, clarifications from all the prospective bidders were necessitated, However, the advice of the consultant was ignored and the single bidder qualified.
The technical evaluation was also uploaded on the PPRA website on March 22.
The sources said one of the aggrieved firms had requested a task team leader of the World Bank to intervene in the matter.
The PMDFC recommended to the administrator of the MC to halt the procurement process till the grievances are addressed by the World Bank and the DC. However, the municipal committee turned a deaf ear to the recommendation of the PMDFC, a monitoring and regulation agency designated by the WB and Punjab government, and opened the technical and financial bids on March 26 and April 22.
PPRA officials had earlier called the administrator on April 18 but neither any responsible officer appeared nor submitted a report or the record, the sources said.

4,Man allegedly strangles wife to death,Suspect attacks victim in connivance with his parents,"A domestic dispute escalated into a murder when a man, along with his parents, reportedly strangled his wife to death.
The incident occurred in Wahdi, Mandi Bahauddin, where police have taken all three suspects into custody.
Rukhsana Saeed, daughter of Saeed Ahmed Awan, had been married to Khurram Shahzad, a resident of 88 WB Wahdi, for the past six years since 2019.
The couple had two children, Hashir Shahzad, aged four, and Hareem Fatima, aged one-and-a-half years. It is alleged that tensions had been brewing between Rukhsana and her husband, exacerbated by frequent arguments, often involving Khurram's aunt, Yasmeen, who is also a schoolteacher.
The situation worsened a few days ago when a heated argument broke out between Khurram Shahzad and Rukhsana.
Khurram allegedly conspired with his parents to strangle Rukhsana to death. Subsequently, they informed Rukhsana's parents that she had fallen down the stairs and died.
Rukhsana's parents took her body to Mandi Bahauddin for burial, where signs of strangulation and other forms of violence were discovered during the bathing ritual.
Upon this revelation, they promptly informed the police, who arrived at the scene.
Sub-Inspector Shabeer Hussain Dogar, Station House Officer of Wahdi Police Station, oversaw the post-mortem examination and handed over the body to the relatives.
A case, numbered 199/24, has been registered on the complaint of Rukhsana's brother, Waqar, leading to the arrest of Khurram, his father Mushtaq, and mother Yasmeen.
Deputy Superintendent of Police, Essa Khan, stated that further action would be taken according to the results of the post-mortem report, ensuring justice is served in accordance with the law.

5,Teacher shortage hits govt schools,Shortage of teachers badly affecting academic activities in govt-run schools,"A shortage of teachers is affecting academic activities in thousands of government schools across Punjab.
According to sources in the Punjab School Education Department, it is estimated that around 500 primary schools in the province have no teacher appointed in them. They rely on staff from other schools to continue their functions.
The sources said around 10,000 schools in the Punjab were operating with one or two teachers.
There is a shortage of more than 100,000 teachers in government schools in the province.
The shortage of teachers has made it difficult for the worst affected schools to continue their routine work. They include a large number of girls schools in remote areas.
The sources said one or two teachers were teaching all the classes in about 10,000 schools.
""There are around 500 schools that do not have a single permanent teacher and staff members from other schools are sent to take classes there,"" a senior official of the Punjab School Education Department told The Express Tribune.
He said the authorities in the department were aware of the situation.
""Thousands schools have one or two teachers and according to reports there are also schools that do not have their own permanent faculty. The reason is that for the past many years teaches have not been recruited in Punjab,"" said Punjab Teachers Union General Secretary Rana Liaqat Ali.
He said the teachers had been demanding recruitment of government school teacjers by the provincial government.
""The government schools had been facing a lack of facilities, including buildings, water supply and toilets but the unavailability of teachers has now become the gravest issue,"" said a headmaster.
He said the shortage of staff was being faced by all primary, secondary and higher secondary schools.
The situation is worst for the village students who lack access to private tuition centres.
The headmaster said the most important role was of science teachers because the students could not study the subjects without their help.
He said the already burdened teachers also had to perform non-academic duties during sections and census.
When contacted, the school education minister's spokesperson Noorul Huda said,
""Teaches shortage is a fact and the government has a plan to streamline the affairs of schools. The government also has a plan to recruit new teaches but it will take a little time.

6,"MPAs unite against government's wheat policy, demand probe",PML-N lawmakers call for accountability regarding decision to import wheat,"In a rare display of unity, both the Opposition and treasury lawmakers have vehemently opposed the government's wheat policy, labelling it the ""farmer enemy policy"" and calling for an investigation into the caretaker government's decision to import wheat, alleging rampant corruption.
The consensus among both sides suggests a growing concern over the exploitation of farmers, with warnings of an imminent wheat shortage if the issue remains unresolved.
Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, has taken action by forming a two-member committee tasked with meeting Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif to convey the House's consensus and subsequently report back to the Assembly on the course of action.
The committee's mandate includes evaluating various aspects of the wheat situation, such as the decision to import wheat by the caretaker government, current wheat stock levels, and measures to support farmers.
Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) lawmaker Rana Shahbaz Ahmad criticised the government's misplaced priorities, accusing it of neglecting public welfare in favour of trivial matters like TikTok.
He warned that the exploitation of farmers could precipitate a crisis in the upcoming wheat season.
Agriculture Minister Ashiq Hussain Kirmani faced scrutiny from Speaker Khan regarding the government's failure to procure wheat, citing sufficient reserves from the previous year. However, most questions were deferred to Food Minister Bilal Yaseen, who was absent from the session.
Members of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) voiced their discontent with the government's policies, with former Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana Muhammad Iqbal Khan expressing concern over the unprecedented hardships faced by farmers.
Other PML-N lawmakers criticised the government's technological solutions, highlighting the impracticality for farmers and demanding accountability for the decision to import wheat.
Amidst pre-budget discussions, a proposal to play the national anthem at the beginning of House proceedings was put forth by PML-N lawmakers, leading to the formation of a committee to introduce amendments for this purpose.
As the day's agenda concluded, Speaker Khan adjourned the House until April 25 at 11 am, leaving the wheat policy debate unresolved but signalling a unified stance against perceived injustices towards farmers.
