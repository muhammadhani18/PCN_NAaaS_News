0,Israel pummels Gaza after US approves military aid,"79 Palestinians killed, 86 wounded by strikes in a single day.","GAZA STRIP: Israeli warplanes pounded the northern Gaza strip for a second day on Wednesday in a fierce assault that has shattered weeks of comparative calm, and Israel said it was moving forward with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah in the south.
The renewed attacks came after the US Congress approved $13 billion in military aid for Tel Aviv.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the Senate’s approval of the aid package already passed by the House of Representatives sent a “strong message to all our enemies” in a post on social media platform X.
 






Even though Western countries, including the United States, have pleaded with it to hold back from attacking the city on Gaza’s southern edge, aspokesperson for PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s government said Israel was “moving ahead” with its plans for a ground operation on Rafah, but gave no timeline.
US-Israeli relations have been strained by Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s determination to send troops into the southern Gazan city of Rafah, where 1.5 million people are sheltering, many in makeshift encampments.

79 Palestinians killed, 86 wounded by strikes in a single day

Early on Wednesday, hospital and security sources in Gaza reported Israeli air strikes in Rafah, as well as the central Nuseirat refugee camp.
An AFP correspondent and witnesses also reported heavy bombardment of several areas of northern Gaza during the night, while Israeli military said its aircraft “struck over 50 targets” over the previous 24 hours.
Nowhere to go
Displaced people sheltering in Rafah are weighing whether to flee again.
Tamer Al-Burai, who fled from Gaza City and is now living in Rafah in a cluster of tents with seven households of extended family, said the entire group was heading for the coast of Khan Younis to the north to try to find a new spot “since Israel sounds more serious in its threats this time”.
At the opposite end of the Gaza Strip, the city of Beit Lahiya came under massive shelling for a second day on Wednesday, a day after the Israeli military ordered residents out of four districts declared a “dangerous combat zone”.
The war, now in its seventh month, has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who say thousands more are feared buried in rubble. The offensive has laid to waste much of the enclave, displacing most of its 2.3 million people and creating a humanitarian crisis.
In the past 24 hours, Israeli strikes have killed at least 79 Palestinians and wounded 86, the Gaza Health Ministry said.
Residents in the north, many of whom have started to return to homes abandoned in the first phase of the war, described some of the most intense bombing since the war’s early weeks.
“We don’t know why this is all happening. Is it because we returned home and we finally got some aid through after months of starvation, and the Israelis didn’t like that?” said Mohammad Jamal, 29, a resident of Gaza City, near Zeitoun, one of Gaza’s oldest suburbs.
“It is as if the war started again. As if it is just happening, they burnt up the place,” he told Reuters via a chat app.
Ismail al-Thawabta, head of the Hamas government media office, said an invasion would be a “crime” and that central Gaza and Khan Yunis “cannot accommodate the numbers of displaced people in Rafah”.
Medics said an Israeli air strike against a group of people in Nasser Street in the heart of Gaza City had killed three people and wounded others. Palestinian journalist Amena Hmaid and one of her children were killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City’s Beach refugee camp, her husband said.

1,Protests on US campuses widen,Many arrested as demos erupt in Brooklyn,"

NEW YORK: Protests against Israel’s unabated assault on Gaza and Rafah filled streets in Brooklyn and escalated at universities across the United States, some of which included Jewish Passover Seders, negating the much-trumpeted accusations of antisemitism.
A large Brooklyn street protest reached a standoff on Tuesday when New York police began to arrest people over “disorderly conduct”, restraining those who refused to move with zip ties.
The Council on American-Islamic Rela­tions criticised the use of police force to stifle dissent, saying it undermined academic freedom.
Several campus protesters Reuters spoke to attributed the off-campus incidents to rogue provocateurs who are trying to hijack the protests’ message.

Many arrested as demos erupt in Brooklyn

“There are no universities left in Gaza. So we chose to reclaim our university for the people of Palestine,” said Soph Askanase, a Jewish Columbia student who was arrested and suspended for protesting. “Antisemitism, Islamo­phobia and racism, in particular racism against Arabs and Palestinians, are all cut from the same cloth.”
Other students blamed universities for failing to protect their right to protest or stand up for human rights.
Students at the University of California, Berkeley — a school well known for its student activism during the 1960s — set up tents in solidarity with protesters at other schools.
California’s Cal Poly Humboldt, a public university in Arcata, was shut down amid pro-Palestinian protests.
At the University of Minnesota campus in St. Paul, police cleared an encampment after the school asked them to take action, citing violations of university policy and trespassing law.
“I don’t see what Israel is doing as self-defence. I see incredible, absolutely unbelievable human rights violations,” said Katherine Stern, 62, of Woodstock, New York, who gave up her family Seder 120 miles away to attend the Brooklyn protest.
In Brooklyn, about 2,000 people occupied a plaza near the Brooklyn home of US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Shumer, a staunch Israel supporter and the top-ranking Jew in the US government, chanting, “Stop arming Israel,” “Stop funding genocide” and “Let Gaza live”.

2,"Blinken back in China with Russia, trade practices on the agenda","SHANGHAI: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned on Wednesday to China on his second visit in a year, as the...","SHANGHAI: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned on Wednesday to China on his second visit in a year, as the United States ramps up pressure on its rival over its support for Russia while also seeking to manage tensions with Beijing.
The US diplomat will meet China’s top brass on Friday in Beijing, where he is also expected to plead for restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new leader, and to raise US concerns on Chinese trade practices — a vital issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.
But Blinken is also seeking to stabilise ties, as he arrived in Shanghai, where he will attend a basketball match between two teams with American players on their rosters.
The Biden administration’s eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The US has accused China of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.
Washington has encouraged European leaders to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing that it wants stable ties with the West.
Another source of friction between them is legislation that cleared the US Congress requiring TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDa­nce, or be shut out of the American market.
Biden faces a rematch in November against Trump, who has vowed a more confrontational appr­oach aga­inst China.

3,Two miners die in Duki after inhaling poisonous gas,"Soon after receiving information about the incident, other mineworkers rushed to the site and launched a rescue operation.","QUETTA: Two workers died after inhaling poisonous gas while working deep inside a coal mine in Duki district of Balochistan on Wednesday.
Levies officials said a group of miners were operating hundreds of feet below the ground when lethal methane gas accumulated in the mine located in the Duki coalfield.
Two of the miners fell unconscious after inhaling the poisonous gas while others succeeded in getting out of the mine.
Soon after receiving information about the incident, other mineworkers rushed to the site and launched a rescue operation. They succeeded in reaching the trapped miners, but found them dead.
“The bodies were shifted to the district hospital where doctors confirmed their death,” the officials said, adding that the bodies were later handed over to their families. They were identified as Abdul Bari and Lali Khan.
Hundreds of miners lose their lives every year due to the presence of methane gas in almost all coalfields in in Balochistan.
Last month, 12 workers were killed and six others injured when a powerful blast took place in a coal mine in the Zardalo area of Harnai district.
Chief Inspector of Mine Balochistan Abdul Ghani Baloch had ordered an inquiry into the incident after sealing the mine. However, no report has so far been released about the findings of the probe committee.
According to the Pakistan Central Mines and Labour Federation president Lala Sultan Achakzai, around 300 mineworkers lose their lives every year, but the authorities concerned reported around 25 per cent of deaths officially.
He said the mine owners and the department concerned failed to ensure proper safety measures in the mines which often caused tragic incidents.
