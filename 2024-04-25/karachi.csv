The police said that Tahir Mehmood had been handed over to the Darakhshan police and they would decide whether to charge him or not.
Tahir had made a video call to his wife late on Monday night and told her that he was going to end his life by jumping into sea near Seaview. Later in the day, a rescue operation had been launched but the divers remained unable to find him.
Shah Faisal Colony SHO Mohammed Ali Marwat said Tahir was found outside a private hospital and was brought to the police station, where he said that he was unhappy with his family life and had created a ‘drama’ to upset his second wife.
He said that he went to the sea, made a video call to his wife and told her that he was committing suicide by jumping into the water. He had left his taxi near the shore. “I just wanted to terrify my family,” he said.
He added that in the meantime, four people came there and gave him something to eat, after which he became unconscious. When he gained consciousness, he found himself in Nazimabad, from where he came to his home in Shah Faisal Colony and went to the hospital for treatment, he said.
His relative, Asrar Ahmed, told the media that Tahir might have taken some tranquiliser when he was found outside the hospital.
SHO Marwat said that since the purported incident had taken place within the remit of the Darakhshan police station, his custody was handed over to them for a possible legal action.
South SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said the police were further probing the issue.

KARACHI: Announcing 150 buses for the metropolis, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday directed the federal authorities to remove all bottlenecks in the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) and assured the Sindh government to resolve all of its financial and development related issues pending with the federal governments.
The prime minister, who arrived in the provincial metropolis on his first visit after taking the oath of the country’s chief executive, chaired a meeting of the Sindh cabinet along with Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah at the CM House.
The PM was accompanied by Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, Science and Technology Minister Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and others.
During the meeting, the prime minister instructed the planning and finance ministers and communication secretary to hold meetings with the chief minister or his team to resolve all the pending issues on priority.
 
 

He stated that he was holding this meeting to resolve all the lingering issues, so that development projects could move forward and financial issues could be resolved.
To show his commitment, he announced that the provincial government would receive 150 buses to add to its fleet.
CM Shah gave a detailed presentation to the prime minister and apprised him of the issues being faced by the provincial government.
PM calls for removing KCR bottlenecks
About the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) project, the CM told the prime minister that on the advice of the federal government, a revised feasibility was undertaken in 2023 and shared with the Economic Affairs Division & Ministry of Transport, Peoples Republic of China on May 4, 2023.
He requested the prime minister to order the ministry concerned to facilitate the framework agreement for the execution of the KCR under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
He also requested the prime minister to direct the railways ministry to grant the “Right of Way” (RoW) of the KCR to the Sindh government.
At this, the prime minister directed the planning minister to take up the KCR project and remove all the impediments in its way so that it could be executed.
NHA asked to allow heavy traffic on Lyari Expressway
Briefing the prime minister, the CM said that the Lyari Expressway was a 16.5-kilometre-long, dual carriageway on the Lyari River banks.
The project was originally designed for heavy traffic, but it was being used for light traffic only, he said and requested the prime minister to direct the National Highway Authority (NHA) to allow heavy traffic on the expressway to ease traffic congestion in the city. The PM directed the NHA to consider the issue and submit a report to his secretariat.
Sindh Transport Minister Sharjeel Memon requested the prime minister to provide 300 buses for Karachi.
 
 

However, the PM said that the federal government would provide 150 buses to the Sindh transport department to add them to their existing fleet.
Hyderabad-Sukkur motorway
About Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway, the PM was informed that the construction of the 306-km-long, six-lane, access-controlled fenced M-6 project was originally included in the CPEC but removed without assigning any reason.
The project was approved by Ecnec in July 2020 with an estimated cost of Rs165.67 billion. It was revised in May 2021 at the cost of Rs191.47bn. The project work was, however, awarded by the NHA for Rs308.194bn under the Public-Private-Partnership mode.

The prime minister directed the NHA chairman to speed up the work on N-55 and report to him. He also ordered the release of funds, if pending.
Earlier, the CM informed the PM that the federal government had not yet released its 50pc share of Rs25bn for the construction of houses for flood-affected people.

The CM said that federal government had asked for schemes to be included in PSDP 2023-24. “The Sindh government submitted 55 schemes but only four were approved and included in the PSDP but not a single penny has been released by the federal government to start the schemes,” he said.

3,SC asks Sindh govt to ensure preservation of Karachi’s Hindu Gymkhana,The heritage building was taken over by the govt after partition; it currently houses Napa.,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Sindh government to take necessary steps for preservation of the historic Hindu Gymkhana building, which is housing the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa).
The three-judge bench of apex court, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, said that parties concerned were at liberty to file their suggestions and the court would consider the same before deciding the matter.
A petition was filed by Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Welfare in 2014 and sought directive for National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) to vacate the building and hand it over to the Hindu community. Later, Dr Ramesh Kumar and some others had filed applications to become interveners in the proceedings.
At the outset of the hearing on Wednesday, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that the heritage site belonged to the Hindu community of Karachi and earlier, the apex court had directed the commissioner to provide alternative accommodation to Napa, which is housing in the heritage building of Hindu Gymkhana.

The heritage building was taken over by the govt after partition; it currently houses Napa

The chief justice asked the counsel as to how they could determine a community and whether there was any allotment letter or other relevant documents about the subject land/building.
The counsel submitted that the Sindh government had admitted the ownership claim of Hindu community over Napa building. At this juncture, the CJP asked the lawyers to advance arguments about their case instead of provincial government and said that the lawyers must come prepared for to argue the cases.
Dr Kumar suggested that the land in question be handed over to the Sindh government. The CJP asked him whether he could tell the court about a single building in the city preserved by the Sindh government and said that the time will come when the rulers will have to think about the masses instead of themselves.
The chief justice also observed that the court was more concerned about Hindu community then the applicants and asked Dr Kumar what party he belonged currently since he used to switch political parties so often. Dr Kumar replied that he was affiliated with the Pakistan Peoples Party.
The bench expressed its displeasure when the lawyers sought one month’s time to come prepared for arguments.
The lawyer for Napa submitted that the building in question was established by Seth Ramgopal Gourdhanandh Mohatta in 1925 and the government had taken over the same after the partition.
Dr Kumar again asked the court that they be declared custodian of the said building so that the Hindu community could carry out social activities on the premises.
The lawyers recommended Yasmain Lari, Arif Hasan, Marvi Mazhar and others after the CJP asked them to suggest the names of architects/experts for the preservation of the heritage building.
Dr Kumar yet again attempted to address the bench and said that he may also be allowed along with others to inspect the building.
The CJP asked Dr Kumar that he may be kept out of this since he had a lot of work to do in the parliament.
However, the advocate general submitted that provincial culture department had already constituted a committee for preservation of heritage sites/buildings.
The bench directed the Sindh government to ensure preservation of the building in question and also said that the parties concerned may file suggestions, if any, by the next hearing and the court would settle the matter after considering the same.
It was contended in the petition that the said heritage site belonged to the Hindu community of Karachi before partition as the gymkhana building was established for the promotion of social and religious activities of Hindus, but the government took it over as an evacuee trust property after partition.
In October 2021, the apex court had expressed concern over an inordinate delay in getting vacated the said building and observed that the apex court had been issuing directives to authorities for the past three years to get the building vacated and grant substitute land to Napa, but the officials were shifting responsibility to each other. It had directed secretary culture department and commissioner Karachi to come up with a report about alternative land to Napa.

5,Shakespeare’s mastery lies in capturing ‘human nature’,The Bard of Avon’s 460th birth anniversary celebrated,"

Prof Abbas Husain speaks at the event. —Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: To celebrate playwright and poet William Shakespeare’s 460th birth anniversary, the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) held an event titled Celebrating Shakespeare across the Globe on Wednesday.  
Eminent scholar Prof Abbas Husain — who talked about the bard first in detail and then in segments — set the tone for the programme by delivering an insightful short speech on the subject.  
He said there were some who said that Shakespeare, along with the game of cricket, was a gift, the most intelligent export of England to other parts of the world. Then there is a scholarship which says actually he is our gift to the British education system because literary theorist Gayatri Spivak in her research has pointed out that during the East India Company’s time a gentleman was coming by ship to India having a stack of published Shakespeare plays which were not selling; so the plays were made part of Indian curriculum and the gora sahib started teaching Shakespeare to Indian children. Subsequently, they realised he’s worth their children, too.  

The Bard of Avon’s 460th birth anniversary celebrated

Prof Husain said his story vis-à-vis Shakespeare began with his mentor, the late Dr Rafat Karim, his first teacher at the University of Karachi in 1974. He was the teacher who in his class used to say Shakespeare was not just a poet, a dramatist, a sonneteer… he’s a lot of other things as well: he was a psychologist, the one who captured the nuances of human nature; he had a [profound] understanding of legal literacy, finance, the dynamics of love. Prof Husain then added, “One of the things that I say to my students is that if human love in relationships is to be captured in literature, watch... You want to see what a mother-son relationship is like [read] Hamlet; you want to see a husband and a wife know each other’s buttons, [read] Macbeth; when things go wrong with a husband and wife [read] Othello; if you want to see a father and a daughter, there’s King Lear; and if you want to see the relationship between a brother and a sister, there’s Measure for Measure. These were the kinds of nuances and realities that this genius was able to capture.”  
After the speech, Prof Husain gave a brief introduction to the scenes from four of Shakespeare’s plays which were performed on stage — Hamlet (the opening scene and Act V, Scene II), the three witches’ scene from Macbeth, the bond scene from The Merchant of Venice and the opening scene from King Lear.  
Each scene was followed by the professor’s commentary on it. In Hamlet, he said the line stand and unfold yourself was important because throughout the play the ‘unfolding’ happens. In Macbeth, the issue of choice is significant because Macbeth knows well what good and evil are. In The Merchant of Venice the interplay between fantasy and reality needs to be looked at. And in King Lear the maintenance of a kingdom is more important than its foundation, and it is in this light that one needs to see Lear’s decision to divide his kingdom.  
Despite the fact that the professor didn’t talk about the translations of Shakespeare’s work in Urdu and Sindhi, the two languages in which the scenes were performed, the professor’s commentaries were absorbing and engaging. However, it seemed that the actors hadn’t paid enough attention to the text and the depth it carried. For example, in the first Hamlet scene, some members of the audience were chuckling, thinking it was a funny sequence. Also, one has noticed that either the acoustics of the Zia Mohyeddin theatre have changed or the actors don’t practise ‘voice projection’ enough. A few of them were barely audible.  
A book exhibition was also lined up for the evening.

Citing the commissioner, home department, police and others as respondents, a petitioner expressed his grievance against illegal making of steel strings used for kite flying and at the last hearing, the SHC had ordered legal action against persons involved in illegal manufacturing of such strings.
When a two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, took up the matter for hearing on Wednesday, several police officials turned up and filed reports on the behalf of SSP West and East.
The bench took the same on record and copies were also provided to the lawyer for petitioner. A provincial law officer submitted that necessary steps had been taken and action will continue against such unscrupulous persons involved in manufacturing and selling steel strings to be used in flying kites.
He also submitted that FIRs had also been lodged under the relevant laws and requested that the petition had served its purpose which may be disposed of.
The lawyer for petitioner did not press the petition, but submitted that respondents may be directed to continue legal action against the persons concerned in accordance with law to avoid further incidents of injuries to people.
“Accordingly, in view of compliance/comments filed and undertaking on behalf of the respondents, instant petition stands disposed of along with listed application”, the bench in its order said.
Earlier, a law officer of Sindh government had informed the SHC that the commissioner had already imposed a ban such activities.
