The decision came during the hearing of a petition, submitted by the president of the Nanbai Welfare Association, presided over by Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri 
The counsel representing the association disputed the controller general's authority under Section III and highlighted the high costs and rents paid by bread makers. 
In response, Justice Jahangiri questioned whether authorities consulted with naanbais regarding flour prices, suggesting actions might be motivated by other factors.
Last week, a dispute arose between the district administration and naanbais over the enforcement of reduced prices of naans in twin cities. Pakistan Naanbai Association opposed the reduction and announced a Rs.5 hike instead, leading to a strike in Punjab.

1,Kremlin says US long-range missiles sent to Ukraine will not change war's outcome,"US involvement and expansion of supplies will not alter outcome of military operation, says Dmitry Peskov","The Kremlin said on Thursday that deliveries of US long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to Ukraine would not change the outcome of the war but would create more problems for Ukraine itself.
The United States in recent weeks secretly shipped long-range missiles to Ukraine, which has so far used them twice, a US official said on Wednesday.
The missiles were used for the first time on April 17 against a Russian airfield in Crimea that was about 165 km (103 miles) from the Ukrainian front lines, the official said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""The US is directly involved in this conflict. They are following the path of increasing the operating range of the weapon systems they supply.""
He added: ""This will not fundamentally change the outcome of the special military operation. We will achieve our goal. But this will cause more problems for Ukraine itself.""
Whether to send the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) with a range up to 300 km was a subject of debate within the Biden administration for months. Mid-range ATACMS were supplied last September.

The order further read that during the jail trial of the PTI founding chairman, the media would limit its coverage to court proceedings and not report the statements of the accused.
The judge in his order also instructed the prosecution, accused and their defence lawyers not to pass political or inflammatory remarks, which might disrupt the decorum of the court.

4,"SC orders removal of encroachments placed outside govt, private buildings in Karachi",CJ says no one should be allowed to obstruct people’s movement," 
The Supreme Court ordered the authorities concerned on Thursday to remove encroachment at all the state-owned as well as private buildings within three days, saying that closing or blocking roads in the name of security or for any other reason was illegal.
During the hearing of an encroachment-related case at the apex court’s Karachi Registry, Chief Justice Qazi Faiz Isa remarked that if the high-ups felt any threat to their security, they should relocate themselves to a remote and secure place, rather than creating difficulties for the general public.
A three-member bench, led by Chief Justice Isa and including Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, heard the petition by the people affected by the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR). The chief justice ordered the authorities to look into the matter brought forth by the petitioners.
“People continue to face attacks and you stay protected, what law is this,” the chief justice remarked during his conversation with the Sindh advocate general, who had mentioned that there were security issues as bomb blasts had happened there.
“If you feel too scared, go to a remote area and sit there but don’t block roads in the name of security,” the chief justice remarked. “No one should be allowed to obstruct the free movement of people. It is illegal to block roads and create obstructions.”
Justice Mandokhel remarked that the judges were in more danger, because the authorities catch terrorists but “we give them the death penalty”. The chief justice pointed out that before he came, the road in front of the Supreme Court Registry was blocked but he ordered for its opening.

The chief justice then mentioned the Rangers headquarters, located in the Jinnah Court, a building just a few hundred metres away from the Supreme Court Karachi Registry. “Tell me where is the Rangers headquarters and where is the footpath [of the road in front of it],” he asked.
The chief justice told the advocate general to inform the court that under which law the Jinnah Court building was given to the Rangers. He also said that Naval Headquarters, Governor’s House, Chief Minister House, Rangers Headquarters all have occupied footpaths.
The federal and the provincial governments themselves were making encroachments, Chief Justice Isa observed. “Does this happen anywhere else in the world,” he asked. While referring to the presence of the mayor of Karachi, he remarked that the city roads were broken at places.
He also mentioned the placing of containers on roads. “Why containers are kept outside the Governor’s House, place them inside,” he remarked. “Do the things that do not disturb people,” he continued. “We say that if there is an encroachment in front of the Supreme Court, remove it, too.”
Chief Justice Isa then told the lawyer for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) that they had demolished the [illegal] homes of ordinary people, but “why don’t you remove the encroachment in front of the Rangers headquarters”.
The chief justice ordered the KMC to remove the encroachments, adding that the expenses incurred on removing the obstructions would be recovered by the KMC from the head of the concerned institution. Later, the court ordered for the removal of barricades outside all government and private buildings.
The court sought a report within three days. The court directed the additional attorney general to inform the federal agencies about the order for removal of encroachments and send a copy of the court orders to all and security agencies concerned.

6,"Wheat import during interim set-up being probed, NA told",Minister says crop’s procurement will improve within next four to five days,"National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer on Wednesday said an inquiry was under way to investigate the decision of the caretaker set-up to import wheat despite the prediction of a local bumper crop.
Responding to the queries of the lawmakers in the National Assembly mainly related to the agricultural sector, the minister also agreed on the formation of a House committee to scrutinise the legitimacy of the decision of import wheat during the interim government’s tenure.
He said on the instruction of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the federal government had sent letters to the four chief ministers, urging them to immediately kick off the process of wheat procurement and enhance their targets accordingly.
The minister assured the MNAs that the situation of procuring wheat would improve within the next four to five days and noted a rise in the rate of the cop to Rs3,400 per 40 kilogrammes despite initially incurring losses.
The minister expressed his gratitude to the House for highlighting critical issues within the farm sector, particularly the wheat production in Sindh and Punjab.
Emphasising wheat as Pakistan’s staple crop, he underscored the importance of determining its support prices to encourage growers, ultimately securing food security for the nation.
However, he acknowledged the fluctuations in the prices and regretted the inefficiency in subsidy distribution, citing instances where it failed to reach its intended recipients – the farmers -- despite its allocation for them.
He disclosed that because of previous wheat imports, a substantial stockpile of 4.1 million tonnes remained.
Tanveer clarified that the provincial governments were responsible for wheat procurement. He highlighted a decline in Punjab’s procurement target from 25% to around 15-16% of the total wheat production because of various challenges, including adverse weather conditions.
The minister emphasised the superior quality of Pakistani wheat in comparison with that produced in Ukraine or any other country.
He pointed out that the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) focused on procurement for strategic reserves and food security, with its own specific targets.
Tanveer assured the MNAs that there would be no hindrance in the supply of fertilisers and their pricing would not pose an issue.
He clarified that the implementation of their plan rested within the purview of the provincial governments, which maintained contracts with dealers for the provision of the crop.
Highlighting the premier’s strong commitment to providing relief to farmers and uplifting the agricultural sector, the minister reiterated the government’s dedication to this cause.
He underscored PM Shehbaz’s keen interest in providing relief to the farmers and fostering growth in the agricultural sector.
Acknowledging the historic contributions of the PML-N in the agricultural domain, he noted that substantial subsidies were provided to the farmers previously and assured the MNAs that further significant relief measures would be included for the growers in the upcoming budget.
The minister highlighted the pivotal role of the agricultural sector as the backbone of the nation and stressed its critical importance in ensuring food security for the country’s population.
He noted that 70% of Pakistan’s population benefitted from food security, stressing the necessity for concerted efforts by both federal and provincial governments to alleviate the plight of the farmers.
The minister confirmed the initiation of wheat procurement and expressed his openness to welcoming proposals from lawmakers in the budgetary process.

7,Pakistan blocking $399m of airline revenues: IATA,"Airlines unable to repatriate, demand immediate release of payment to Pakistan, Bangladesh","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has demanded that the Pakistani government should immediately release the blocked payments to the international airlines operating in the country, compounding the difficulties faced by the local aviation industry, which was already suffering because of global bans.
It also told the Bangladeshi government to pay the held revenues to the airlines.
“The situation has become severe with airlines unable to repatriate over $720 million ($399 million in Pakistan and $323 million in Bangladesh) of revenues earned in these markets,” read a statement issued by IATA.
“Delaying repatriation contravenes international obligations written into bilateral agreements and increases exchange rate risks for airlines,” it quoted IATA’s Regional Vice President for Asia-Pacific Philip Goh as saying.

8,Balochistan bar supports IHC judges’ stance,"Requests SC to declare all meddling in court affairs a threat to law, independence of the judiciary","The Balochistan Bar Council (BBC) has filed a constitution petition in the Supreme Court, supporting the stance of the six Islamabad High Court (IHC) who last month accused the country’s spy agencies of meddling in the court’s affairs through coercive tactics.
In the petition filed through Hamid Khan Advocate, the bar council has named the federation and the government of Pakistan as respondents.
It has requested the court to declare all actions mentioned by the IHC judges in their letter dated March 26 as being allegedly taken to state institutions in a bid to interfere in court matters “unconstitutional and a threat to law, access to justice and independence of the judiciary”.
The bar counsel has requested the top court to direct the federal government to deal with those found involved in the illegal act of meddling with court affairs in accordance with the law. “[The court may also] direct the respondents to ensure that in future no such incidents take place,” it said.
On March 25, six of the eight IHC judges wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) chairman, Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, making serious allegations against state agencies for using coercive tactics to influence the bench.
The letter whipped up a storm with the government announcing to form an inquiry commission to probe into the allegations. Later, the Supreme Court took suo motu notice of the letter after former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani refused to head the proposed commission.
The IHC on Tuesday unanimously acknowledged that intelligence agencies were “interfering” in their judicial functions during a full court meeting presided over by IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.
The meeting had been convened in view of the Supreme Court's order seeking proposals from high courts as to how to protect their independence from the “interference” of agencies.
Earlier, both the Lahore and Peshawar high courts held full court meetings to discuss the matter.
All eight judges of the IHC agreed that the interference of agencies in judicial functions would not be tolerated. They also decided to chalk out new standard operating procedures (SOPs) on how the judiciary would respond in case the agencies “meddle” in its affairs in the future.
Sources told The Express Tribune that inspection judges were not empowered in the past. Now they have been given the authority to recommend to the IHC CJ what action to take against those who interfered in the functions of the judges of district courts.
They will share their proposals as to how the independence of the judiciary can be secured.

9,Vawda raises significant questions on judicial system,"Justice Babar Sattar should come clean about charges against him, says former minister"," 
Expressing his gratitude to PPP and MQM-P for their support, Senator Faisal Vawda on Wednesday said he was elected senator as an independent candidate.
“I am pro army and ‘selective pro-judiciary’. [I haven’t] come [to Senate] after begging someone or making a compromise, nor have I had my cases forgiven,” Vawda said while talking to a private TV channel.
The senator maintained that during his contact with former chief justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, he found all of them humble, despite the fact that all of them were “top most judges”.
“The questions they asked me were fair. It was in response to their this act that I resigned from my Senate seat,” he said.
“Like other shameless people, I did not acquire MNA or Senate seat after leaving Imran Khan or giving statement against him.”
He credited ex-CJP Bandial, Justice Ayesha and Justice Shah for “instilling” in him the “moral values” that led to his resignation from the Senate seat.
Vawda further said he had seen judges who set aside the law on “six v-logs” and invent new laws to serve their own purposes.

Directing a pun at these judges, he said represent “6 as 9 and 9 as 6”.
“This is still happening and I will criticise [these judges]. I will fight on this issue so that our judiciary ranks number one from 149. Otherwise, given our current pace, we will end up in 209th place,” he said.
The senator said he did not know Islamabad High Court’s Babar Sattar personally but felt that that he was a “better person or judge”as he was “appointed during their government”.
Vawda said he had heard many “negative things” about Justice Sattar within his cabinet.
The senator asserted his belief that when criticism is directed at an individual, there should be a discernible ""spark"" within them.
Referring to Justice Sattar and other judges on the Lettergate scandal, Vawda questioned why the judges’ conscience remained dormant during the demolition of Nasla Tower.
“When sessions court judge’s wife tortured the daughter of a poor person, the high court should have taken notice of it.”
Vawda said news was circulating on social media that Justice Sattar was running a school chain. “We don’t know if it is true or false. Justice Sattar should come and clear himself.”
