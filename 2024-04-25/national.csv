• Premier legal body yet to work out proposals sought by apex court
• SCBA says consultative meeting to be held on May 8
ISLAMABAD: Disquiet is gro­wing within the ranks of the Su­­p­reme Court Bar Association (SCBA) over the indecision on its response to a letter, written by six judges of the Islamabad High Court, alleging meddling in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies.
A similar reluctance is evident on the part of the government, which may not furnish any reply or suggestion to the Supreme Court, since it believes that it is an institutional matter and should be decided by the institution itself.
The SCBA has been hesitant in charting a course to ensure the independence of judiciary, as required by the Supreme Court, which is seized with a suo motu case against the backdrop of the March 25 letter written by the six IHC judges.
In its April 3 order, the apex court had asked the SCBA and the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) to furnish their proposals by April 25, after proper consultation within the respective bodies.
The SC had expressed the confidence that the association will furnish practical suggestions for realising a robust and independent judiciary, free from external pressures not to compromise its integrity and fair administration of justice.
Consequently, some members of the SCBA’s 26th executive committee confided to Dawn that despite requests for an urgent meeting to chalk out the association’s response, no such huddle seems to be on the cards in the near future.
One of the body’s senior members even requisitioned a meeting at the earliest possible date, on or before April 25, to discuss the contents of the judges’ letter and examine the implications of the SC’s April 3 order in the context of the allegations of executive interference.
The member said the me­­e­ting should also consider ap­­propriate responses and act­ions to be taken by the association for upholding the in­­d­ependence of judiciary, ad­­­dressing encroachments by the executive branch and formulating recommendations and strategies to prevent future occurrences of such interference by streng­thening the rule of law.
SCBA President Shahzad Shaukat, when approached, rubbished the claim that no meeting was being called, saying that in fact a consultative meeting has been called for May 8.
“We believe that a suitable response on behalf of the association should be given to the Supreme Court — a response befitting of the premier association,” he said, adding that the SCBA has sought input from members which will be deliberated upon during the May 8 meeting for developing an official statement on behalf of the association.
PBC’s stance
When the chairman of the executive committee of Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), Farooq Naek, was asked why no meeting was called, he said the PBC had already held a meeting on April 5, in which a resolution was approved seeking an impartial investigation by a judicial commission consisting of SC’s sitting judges to settle the issues raised by the six IHC judges.
The resolution poin­ted out that when judges ex­­press concern through a written letter, it signifies a moment of great significa­n­­ce to the independent working of judicial system. Thus to safeguard law, Consti­tution and fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan, a comprehensive investigation into these allegations is not only justified but necessary, it had emphasised.
“This is our response to the Supreme Court and it will remain so,” Mr Naek explained.
Govt reluctance
A source privy to the development told Dawn that the federal government may also not furnish any reply or suggestion to the Supreme Court, since it believes that it is an institutional matter and should be decided within the institution.
Besides, he explained, there was no need of giving any reply when the IHC judges had accused the government or institutions of meddling into the judicial affairs. However, the government will follow any directions issued by the court.
Since a number of petitions have also been filed before the apex court, the source said, it is likely that the SC may consider issuing notices to the respondents and may give another opportunity to the bar associations to furnish their response.
Another plea
On Wednesday, the Balochis­tan Bar Council and the Baloch­istan High Court Bar Association moved separate petitions before the Supreme Court seeking a direction that illegal acts of meddling into judicial affairs should be declared unconstitutional and unlawful rather a threat to the rule of law, access to justice and independence of judiciary.
The court should also ord­er the federal government to deal in accordance with law with those who were found involved in such matters.

1,Intelligence agencies lack self-accountability: IHC judge,Justice Kayani questions efficacy of commission on missing persons,"ISLAMABAD: Expressing concern over the state of human rights in the country, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the Islamabad High Court on Wednesday observed that unlike law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies lacked self-accountability.  
The IHC judge also questioned the efficacy of the commission on missing persons.  
Justice Kayani, while hearing a case relating to Baloch missing persons, remarked that the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances appeared to be “hand in glove” with those behind the disappearances of citizens.  
During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan submitted a report on Baloch missing persons to the court.  

Justice Kayani questions efficacy of commission on missing persons

Justice Kayani noted that police and other law enforcement agencies were working under their respective statutes, but the intelligence agencies were operating without any statutory framework and, prima facie, lacked self-accountability.  
He asked the attorney general to inquire from the defence ministry if there is any mechanism to keep check on the operatives of intelligence agencies.  
He remarked that the petition had pointed out a number of human rights violations and made it clear that courts would not rescue any terrorist; however, the judiciary will intervene to stop extrajudicial acts.  
Imaan Mazari, the counsel for the petitioner, argued that the day when caretaker prime minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar appeared before the court, intelligence agencies picked up another Baloch student.  
At this, Justice Kayani remarked it showed that the statement of the prime minister was worthless.  
When the judge asked about the status of the court-appointed committee on missing persons comprising director generals of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Military Intelligence and Intelligence Bureau, the attorney general replied that the government had challenged the said order in the Supreme Court.  
The court adjourned the proceedings till May 21.

2,"PTI, allies to protest ‘worst-ever’ poll rigging tomorrow","Online meeting held to discuss the issue and chalk out a plan for Friday’s protests, which will be held across the country.","LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), in collaboration with five other opposition parties, will launch a mass protest movement against what it calls “worst-ever rigging” in the general elections and subsequent by-polls, on Friday (tomorrow).
On Wednesday, an online meeting of PTI Punjab  office-bearers, MNAs, MPAs and ticket-holders was held to discuss the issue and chalk out a plan for Friday’s protests, which will be held across the country.
Chaired by the party’s Central Punjab general secretary Hammad Azhar, the meeting took stock of the “stealing of PTI-backed candidates’ mandate” in all national and provincial assembly constituencies across Punjab.
The party accuses the Punjab government and Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of orchestrating rigging in the recent polls.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Azhar said the Maryam Nawaz government, ECP, police and other state institutions maneuvered and altered the results of PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council candidates to turn their victories into defeat.
PTI’s Punjab Informa­tion Secretary Shaukat Basra said rigging in by-elections had defeated the hopes of the nation. He was of the opinion that the Constitution had been trampled by repeated violation of law and the nation would surely rise to take revenge for their stolen mandate.
Meanwhile, at a press conference in Karachi, PTI Sindh leader Haleem Adil Sheikh said the party had sought permission from the Sindh High Court for tomorrow’s protest, and that they planned to organise another rally near the Mazar-i-Quaid on May 5.
He recalled how official machinery had been used to curtail PTI’s political activities in the past by putting the city in lockdown or denying permission for their rallies.

3,IHC irked by investigation officer’s absence at Imran’s bail hearing,"Special prosecutor of the National Accounta­bility Bureau (NAB), Amjad Pervaiz, was also absent.","ISLAMABAD: The Isla­mabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday expressed displeasure at the absence of the investigation officer during the hearing on the petition seeking post-arrest bail for former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, in a £190 million corruption case.
The IHC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, resumed hearing on the bail petitions. Special prosecutor of the National Accounta­bility Bureau (NAB), Amjad Pervaiz, was also absent.
His associate informed the court that since there was no intimation about the fixing of the case, Mr Pervaiz could not come from Lahore. Justice Farooq responded that the bail petitions are automatically fixed after a certain period.
The court, however, asked the counsel of Mr Khan, Sardar Latif Khan Khosa, to advance the arguments. Mr Khosa argued that the amount in question was transferred from the UK to Pakistan under an agreement, which was then deposited into the Supreme Court’s account.
Justice Jahangiri inquired about how the amount landed in the SC’s accounts. Mr Khosa replied that it was transferred under a confidential deed signed by the then adviser on accountability, Miraz Shahzad Akbar.
Advocate Khosa added that the Supreme Court opened an account into which Malik Riaz was asked to deposit Rs460 billion. Justice Jahangiri further inquired if the amount was crime proceeds and why it was frozen in the UK.
The counsel replied that it was a suspicious transaction, which was later cleared.
The court questioned why the adviser of the then prime minister was a signatory of an agreement between the National Crime Agency UK and the property tycoon Malik Riaz, and why the private agreement was presented before the federal cabinet for approval.
The court adjourned further hearing till April 29.

4,One killed as violence disrupts re-polling in Kohlu,"PkMAP candidate challenges by-election results in PB-50, cites irregularities","QUETTA: Violence again disrupted the electoral process on Wednesday in Balochistan’s PB-9 (Kohlu) constituency, where re-polling was scheduled following previous allegations of irregularities.
The area witnessed a series of violent attacks, including rocket firings and landmine explosions, leading to the death of a PPP worker and injuries to Levies force personnel.
Confirming the disruption, the provincial election commission cited the inability of polling staff to reach their designated posts due to the precarious security situation, marked by explosions and rocket fire near the polling stations.
The primary contenders for PB-9 are Nawab Jangeez Marri of PML-N and Mir Nasibullah Marri of PPP. Initially, Mr Nasibullah emerged victorious in the Feb 8 election, but his win was contested by opponents who alleged rigging in certain polling stations.

PkMAP candidate challenges by-election results in PB-50, cites irregularities

Following hearings, the ECP ordered re-polling in seven stations, subsequently declaring Nawab Jangeez Khan Marri as the winner. However, after his opponent once again approa-ched the Election Commission with rigging complaints, the ECP ordered re-polling in four stations.
The situation turned violent last night when unidentified assailants launched rockets near the election camp of Mir Nasibullah Marri, killing one of his supporters.
Additional rockets and landmine explosions followed in the Nasao area of Kohlu, causing damage to property, including a vehicle. Gunfire also took place in the area, in which a Levies soldier was injured.
The situation in the area remains tense, with the district administration deploying a heavy contingent of security forces.
PB-50 results challenged
Mirwais Khan Achakzai, the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) candidate for the provincial constituency PB-50 (Qila Abdullah), has rejected the April 21 by-election results.
During a press conference in Quetta on Wednesday, Mr Achakzai, flanked by party Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal and other party members, insisted that he was the rightful winner and called for the returning officer to release the actual Form 45 results that he claimed showed his victory.
Mr Achakzai alleged that during the by-election, held under directives from the Supreme Court, the polling stations had been improperly staffed by supporters of his opponent, who acted as polling officials.
He also claimed that on the eve of the elections, staff from five polling stations were abducted. He said a complaint was formally lodged with both the Election Commission of Pakistan and the returning officer concerned, but it went unresolved.
According to Mr Achakzai, the absence of polling staff led to fraudulent activities at the stations, where presiding officers allegedly produced fake Form 45s that were accepted by the returning officer.
He highlighted discrepancies, such as voter turnout being lower than the total votes reported and missing ballots. He noted that some presiding officers had sent letters to their polling agents pointing out these irregularities.
Mr Achakzai also expressed his concern over procedural breaches, mentioning that two separate Form 47s were sent — one on the polling day and another the following day — which he deemed a clear violation of the Elections Act and Rules of 2017.
“We demand that our victory be officially recognised by a margin of over 14,000 votes and that those involved in the election manipulation be held accountable under the law,” he said.

5,"President Zardari seeks greater Chinese, Australian investment",Says Gwadar Port would not only promote regional connectivity but also make transpo­r­ting goods to China cost-effective.,"ISLAMABAD: Presi­d­ent Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday called on Chi­nese and Australian investors to capitalise on opportunities across various se­c­tors in Pakistan, inclu­d­ing agriculture, trade, economy, and infrastructure.
During a meeting with Luo Zha­o­hui, chairman of the China Inter­national Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), who met Mr Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr along with a delegation, the president said Pakis­tan and China enjoyed long-term strategic relations, which needed to be further strengthened in the areas of trade, economy, agriculture, people-to-people contacts, and culture.
According to the Pres­idency, Mr Zardari underlined the need for both countries to continue wor­king together to improve bilateral relations.
The Chinese ambassador to Pak­is­tan, Jiang Zai­dong, Plan­ning Co­m­mi­­ssion Deputy Cha­ir­man Dr Jaha­nzeb Khan, and senior government officials also attended the meeting.
Reiterating Pakistan’s firm commitment to China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Presi­dent Zardari said Pakistan accorded immense strategic importance to the multibillion-dollar project and was fully committed to the timely completion of all CPEC projects.
Highlighting the importance of Gwadar Port, he said it would not only promote regional connectivity but also make transpo­r­ting goods to China cost-effective. He also sugge­sted undertaking joint tr­a­ining projects to equip workers with skills considering the Chinese demand.
Mr Luo, the CIDCA chairman, briefed Presi­dent Zardari about the agency’s role in Pakistan’s socio-economic development and its contributions in the health and education sectors. He also underlined the need to promote tourism and agricultural cooperation bet­ween the two countries.
The president expre­ssed grief over the last month’s Bisham suicide bombing, in which five Chinese wor­kers and a local were kill­ed, saying that Pakis­tan would make all-out efforts to provide a safe environment for Chinese workers and investors in Pakistan.
Mr Luo said the enemies of the two countries wanted to harm bilateral relations, but they would never succeed in their designs.
The president thanked the Chinese government for supporting Pakistan and playing a vital role in Pakistan’s economic deve­l­o­pment. He also appreciated CIDCA’s contributions to the rehabilitation of flood-affected people and reconstruction of sch­ools in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Sindh, as well as the construction of housing units for lady health workers in Sindh and Balochistan.
Australian high commissioner
In a separate meeting with the high commissio­ner of Australia to Pakis­tan, Neil Hawkins, Presid­ent Zardari said the two countries enjoyed a durable relationship and urged Australian companies to invest in different sectors of Pakistan, including agriculture, agricultural equipment and other tools.
The president expr­e­ssed satisfaction with the bilateral cooperation in the mining and mineral sectors.

6,UK court set to decide Altaf Hussain appeal in assets case,"The MQM-P, represented by IT Minister Aminul Haque, was declared to be the beneficiaries of the trusts and therefore of the properties.","LONDON: MQM sup­remo Altaf Hussain appe­ared in a UK High Court on Tuesday and Wednesday as part of a two-day hearing in his appeal against the MQM-P in a case related to London properties. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its verdict, which is expected this week.
Last year, the MQM-P had triumphed over Mr Hussain when the court said that seven London properties valued at about GBP10 million were the possession of the MQM-P.
The MQM-P, represented by Information Technology Minister Aminul Haque, was declared to be the beneficiaries of the trusts and therefore of the properties.
The trial pivoted on the ownership of these properties and saw Mr Hussain battle it out with party factions and ex-loyalists over who was the party’s true leader and therefore a beneficiary of seven assets.
The MQM had split into two factions: MQM-Lon­don and MQM-Pakistan, in August 2016, after a Mr Hussain’s spe­ech triggered violence in Karachi.
In March last year, the judge found that it was not established that the 2015 MQM constitution was adopted by the MQM-P. Instead, it was the April 2016 constitution which was adopted by MQM-P.
Mr Hussain filed an app­eal in June 2023 against the order of ICC Judge Jones.

7,"Drug court hands down prison terms, fines in rare verdict","GSK disputes ruling, announces intention to challenge judgement.","• Pharma firm’s CEO, three others to face punitive action
• GSK disputes ruling, announces intention to challenge judgement
• Verdict surprises pharmaceutical industry; drug lawyer says punitive actions could lead to ‘toning down’ of drug laws
ISLAMABAD: Considered to be one of the first cases in the history of Pakistan, the Rawalpindi Drug Court has awarded imprisonment and heavy fines to the CEO and other employees of a pharmaceutical company in a case involving a medicine that was found to be ‘substandard’.
The company, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which is considered one of the most credible and well-reputed companies in Pakistan and across the globe, has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and announced its intention to challenge the judgement before the appellate forum.
According to the judgement seen by Dawn, the complaint was filed by the Provincial Inspector of Drugs Tehsil Hasan Abdal. He stated that in 2018, another drug inspector, Uzma Khalid, took a sample of tablet Septran, batch number HSBDS, manufactured by GSK and sent to Drug Testing Laboratory Rawalpindi, which had declared the drug substandard.
The representatives of the company were charge-sheeted by the court in February 2023. However, all the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and faced a trial.
The judgement said that GSK, with an estimated net worth of $82.38 billion, has production and quality control units. However, it did not bother to recall or stop marketing the drug, nor did it conduct any inquiry regarding the manufacturing of the substandard drug.
The court found the company’s CEO, production manager, quality control manager and warrantor guilty.
The CEO was awarded imprisonment until the rising of the court and an overall fine of Rs4.7 million. She may face three months in prison if she fails to pay the fine.
The three others have each been awarded two years in prison and a fine of Rs600,000. They will face an additional six months’ imprisonment each in case of failure to pay the fines.
However, GSK Secretary Agha Salman Taimur has announced the company’s intention to challenge the judgement before the appellate forum.
In a letter to the Pakistan Stock Exchange,  seen by Dawn, he wrote: “GSK as well as the officers impleaded in the proceedings hereby  deny any sort of wrongdoing in the matter and are taking immediate steps  to challenge the aforementioned judgment before the appellate forum.”
Verdict triggers debate
The judgement was announced by a three-member bench headed by Chairman Drug Court Rawalpindi, Nadeem Babar Khan, and has triggered a debate in the pharmaceutical sector and health fraternity.
While explaining the case, Pakistan Drug Lawyers Forum President Noor Muhammad Mahar said that there was nothing wrong with the quality of the medicine.
“In simple words, it had an accurate percentage of molecules, but during testing, the dissolution time of the tablet was not accurate. The tablet was taking more time to disintegrate,” he said.
When asked about the dissolution, he explained that film-coated tablets disintegrated within 30 minutes in the stomach and other coated tablets disintegrated within 60 minutes. If a tablet took more time to disintegrate, it would take more time to cure the ailment.
“All medicines should disintegrate as per the standards of the US Pharmacopoeia, and action can be taken in case of any difference. However, even I could not digest the imprisonment.”
He feared that this verdict may prompt a campaign to amend the Drug Act and tone down the punishments contained in it. “If this happens, in the future, we will see only the imposition of fines instead of imprisonment,” he said.
Mr Mahar warned that the decision could have a negative impact, and patients would ultimately suffer as laws might be relaxed in the future and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) could become dysfunctional. He suggested establishing a commission to look into the case.
The head of a pharmaceutical company, who asked not to be named, said that he had never heard of such a decision before.
“It seems that the decision was taken because of some issue, as the court was issuing notices again and again but the company was not taking it seriously. The company representatives should have been more submissive in court rather than arguing too much. This decision serves as a lesson for other companies as well,” he said.
A senior officer of the health ministry, requesting anonymity, said that the courts make decisions according to the law.
“All courts have the power to take strict action and award imprisonment, so pharmaceutical companies should not take the drug courts lightly,” he said.
