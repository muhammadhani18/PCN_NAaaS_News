0,PML-F acuses MQM-P of extortion,PML-F acuses MQM-P of extortion,"Pakistan Muslim League Functional (PML-F) Sindh General Secretary Sardar Abdul Rahim accused Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) activists of attacking PML-F workers when they stopped them from extracting extortion money from shopkeepers at Meena Bazaar.
MQM-P should not consider PML-F's silence as weakness, Sardar Rahim said addressing a press conference at Karachi Press Club on Wednesday. PML-F's leaders Waqar Hussain Jatt, Naeem Sajjad, Zakir Patni and others were present on this occasion.
Rahim said that on nights of April 18 and 19, this problem came to light that MQM-P's workers used to extort money from shopkeepers in Meena Bazaar, Karimabad . When shopkeepers complained, some of PML-F's workers tried to settle matter and sided with shopkeepers, on which MQM workers got fired up. Dozens of them attacked and assaulted their rivals and injured one of them. It is ironic how police are supporting them. He further said that local officials of MQM, including Saqib Ghani, are involved in this action.
A JIT had already been formed against Saqib Ghani in past as he has been involved in target killing and extortion. Purpose of press conference is to reveal PML-F's fear that these people may worsen situation in future. Functional League is informing relevant high authorities through press conference that they withdrew its candidates in favor of MQM's in election and reward is being given. Rahim said that PML-F will continue to stand with people and highlight their problems. He said that public knows who terrorist is.

2,Call to combat illegal structures in Murree,Public officials trade blames in wake of crackdown against illegal constructions,"Amid the ongoing operation against illegal constructions in the scenic hill resort of Murree and an ensuing blame game within public departments, Murree Municipal Employees Union President Naveed Ahmed Abbasi has emphasised the need to combat illegal constructions by establishing a Building Control Authority and implementing building bylaws spanning at least three decades.
Abbasi pointed out that while municipal employees are being ‘unfairly’ blamed for these constructions, the actual responsibility lies with the relevant officers. He advocated for holding accountable those officials who oversaw these illegal constructions and suggested enforcing penalties for violations of building bylaws.
Naveed Abbasi highlighted the misallocation of responsibilities within the municipal corporation, noting that employees from various branches were tasked with building inspections instead of their designated roles. He urged for their reassignment and stressed the scarcity of qualified building inspectors, with only one out of eight meeting the necessary qualifications.
To address these issues, he proposed the formation of a high-level inquiry commission to investigate and take action against implicated officers. Until the inquiry concludes, he recommended placing all officers stationed in Murree on the Exit Control List (ECL). Furthermore, he suggested that significant revenue could be generated for the institution by transferring government-owned land under the Murree Municipal Corporation's jurisdiction.
In a bid to rectify the situation, the union leader called upon the owners of 176 buildings to submit affidavits detailing payments made to officials, promising support for the return of such funds. Building inspectors were urged to scrutinise these financial transactions. He also expressed concern for construction workers, many of whom are non-locals, and advocated for measures to safeguard their investments.
The legal ramifications of illegal constructions in Murree were underscored by recent developments. On Tuesday, arrest warrants were issued for officials from the Murree district administration and Municipal Corporation in a contempt of court case related to these constructions, resulting in a temporary halt to ongoing operations against illegal structures. Subsequently, the local court mandated a Rs1 million bond from the Murree administration in the contempt case, with officials appearing in court and securing bail against this bond.
The developments have once again spotlighted the multifaceted challenges posed by illegal constructions in Murree.

3,Bidders spoil ‘lucrative’ cattle market auction,The contractors at the cattle market ahead of Eidul Azha offered a much lower price,"The Cantonment Board Rawalpindi had to face extreme embarrassment after contractors, gathered for the auctioning bid of the cattle market ahead of Eidul Azha on Wednesday, offered a much lower price.
All the contractors, who participated in the cattle market auction last year and booked an auction for Rs89.5 million, pooled this time and made an offer of only Rs50m. ‘After getting disappointed’, the Cantonment Board has prepared a strategy for the re-auction.
The auctioning of the Bhatta Ground cattle market, which was auctioned for Rs7m, Rs70m and Rs89.5m in the past, was held at the Cantonment Board’s office yesterday. When the cantonment administration started the auction with Rs89.5m, all the contractors gave a bid of Rs50m in the first attempt and continued with the same bid despite repeated attempts. To this, the cantonment administration declared the first attempt of the auction as a failure and decided to set a new date for the next auction.
Sources said that the next auction would be conducted with a new strategy to get higher bids than last year's auction and any attempt for polling by the bidders would be thwarted.

4,Cop selling drugs apprehended,Elite Force HQ head constable in Rawalpindi was involved in illicit drug trade for two years,"The head constable of the Elite Force was arrested by Gujar Khan police and 1800g of hashish was recovered from his possession.
The police report has revealed that the head constable posted at the Elite Force headquarters in Rawalpindi had been involved in the nefarious drug trade for two years.
Rawalpindi SSP Operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar said that there is no place for criminal elements in the force. “Along with legal action against the head constable, departmental action is also being taken,” he said.
Head Constable, Taqdees-ul-Islam of the Elite Force was arrested from Gujar Khan area on charges of drug peddling. A case was registered against the accused in Gujar Khan police station on the statement of Sub-Inspector Naveed Aslam, in which he had reported that he was on patrol when he checked Taqdees-ul-Islam as he was riding a motorcycle, he found 1800g of hashish with him, after which he was taken into custody.
On the other hand, the report had said that the accused was a head constable in the Elite Force and was posted at the Rawalpindi Elite Headquarters. The accused had allegedly been involved in drug smuggling and drug selling business for the past two years. On suspicion, the police had previously sent someone to purchase drugs from him, thus confirming his participation in the illegal activity.
According to sources, there was chaos among the officers at the police station due to the involvement of the Head Constable of the Elite Force in the drug trade. Even though, at first attempts were made to suppress the matter at the police station, when the information reached the officers, they gave orders to register a case against the accused immediately.
Rawalpindi SSP Operations Flight Lieutenant Retd Hafiz Kamran Asghar rejected the extension of any leniency to the accused. He said that elements involved in criminal activities have no place in the force. The process of self-accountability is ongoing in the force. Along with legal action, departmental action has also been initiated against the accused head constable.

5,Public hearing held for grid station project,Venture aims to enhance power supply efficiency in the federal capital,"The Pakistan-Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) held a public hearing of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report of the construction of 132 KV Grid Station and its feeding transmission lines to be established at the Cabinet Division Housing Society at E-16 Sector of the federal capital on Thursday at Margalla View Marquee.
The EIA public hearing is mandatory for any development project in the federal capital before seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the public development authority under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (PEPA) 1997 and Review of IEE/EIA Regulations, 2000.
The Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) under its 7th STD programme intends to install a grid station in the Cabinet Division Housing Society (CDHS), Islamabad to provide a reliable supply of power to Roshan Pakistan, Dhok Doray, Dohk Pind Padian, Gulshan Sihat, Dhok Paracha, Engineers Housing Society, Farming Housing Society, Itifaq Housing Society, Sector D-12, Sangjani and Tarnol Islamabad, an official document available with APP stated these details.
The main purpose of the project was to increase the efficiency, reliability, and quality of the electricity supply to Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The CDHS has provided 32 kanals of land free of cost to establish the air insulated station (AIS) 132KV Grid Station that will have a two-kilometre-long transmission line consisting of 14 poles. However, the estimated cost of the project is Rs1,300 million which will be completed within a year.
In case the project is implemented then it will incur heavy financial losses to IESCO and its consumers due to inconsistent power supply and repeated outages, whereas the implementation of the project will help reduce the burden on the company's only grid station in the area.
As a crucial part of the environmental assessment, public consultation was held with the local masses that all supported the project and believed that it would usher eco-friendly development in the area and agreed that it would also address the rapid increase in electric load demand, need to increase efficiency, reliability, and quality of the electricity supply in the area, whereas the major concerns were of increased traffic congestions, over-extraction of groundwater, sewage treatment plant, shrinking green spaces due to urbanisation projects, and solid waste management during construction and operational phase of the project. However, the project proponent in the EIA Report has proposed that issues like soil erosion would be mitigated during land clearing, levelling and grading.
The excavated slopes would not be left untreated for prolonged durations and proper stabilising measures will be undertaken.
Moreover, sceptic tanks would be constructed with soaking pits to contain domestic sewage of the contractor’s camp, whereas vertical SBR plants have been proposed for the operational phase, waste oils to be collected in drums and sold for recycling along with other recyclable materials.
The EIA report claimed that the project implementation would cause environmental impacts mainly during its construction phase that could be mitigated through the proposed activities mentioned above completely and effectively.

6,Retailers defy new price list for food items,Standoff sparks heating debate over pricing regulations,"The Rawalpindi district administration issued on Wednesday a notification of new prices for food items, pulses, rice, meat, milk, and yoghurt. However, the Grocery Merchants Association, Naanbai Union, Gowala Union and Mutton Beef Retailers Association refused the new prices, considering them as ""drawing room rates"", and decided not to sell their products at the updated official rates.
Per the announcement made by the deputy commissioner, milk is available for purchase at the rate of Rs170 per kg, yoghurt at Rs200 per kg, mutton meat at Rs1,600 per kg, and beef meat at Rs800 per kg. The price of white chickpeas is set at Rs325 per kg, black gram Rs240 per kg, gram flour Rs245 per kg, split chickpea lentils Rs245 per kg, yellow split gram Rs290 per kg, red lentil thick Rs310 per kg, lentil mash Rs490 per kg, basmati rice Rs300 per kg, and the price of broken rice is set at Rs155 per kg. The price of red flour roti has been fixed at Rs16 and white flour roti has been fixed at Rs20. The prices of spices, flour, and sugar have been left open to decide.
Contrary to the official rates, shopkeepers in the open market are selling fresh milk at Rs200 per kg, yoghurt at Rs220 per kg, mutton meat at Rs2,300 per kg, beef meat at Rs1,200 per kg, white chickpeas Rs400 per kg, black gram Rs290 per kg, gram flour Rs300 per kg, split chickpea lentils Rs310 per kg, red lentil thick Rs350 per kg, lentil mash Rs530 per kg, Basmati rice Rs400 per kg, and broken rice at Rs200 per kg.
Nanbais are charging for red flour roti at both official and unofficial rates of Rs16 and Rs20 in the open market. They have reduced the weight of the ball of dough to 90 grams for Rs16 price. Khamiri roti is still being sold at Rs20 to 25 and naan at Rs30.
Chaudhry Khurram Gujjar, the secretary of the Gowala Union, says the milk price was Rs170 per kg in 2021. But now the price of buffalo has skyrocketed to around Rs650,000 and fodder has also increased by 1000%, making it unfeasible to sell milk at this price. Therefore, the milk price will remain at Rs200 per kg and will not be reduced under any circumstances, he makes it clear.
Arshad Qureshi, the vice president of the Mutton Beef Retailers Union, emphasised the importance of conducting market visits to determine the fixed price of meat. In 2021, mutton was priced at Rs1,600 per kg, however, due to a significant increase in the prices of all animals, both small and large, it is unlikely that the price of meat will decrease.
Ayaz Khan and Roshan Deen, local shopkeepers of the Grocery Merchant Association, are of the view that all pulses are imported from foreign countries, resulting in higher wholesale prices compared to the new official rates. They have made it clear that they will not purchase costly pulses and sell them at lower prices. “We ask the DC to tell us about the wholesale shop from where we could get cheap pulses and rice at the official rate. Until then, the old high prices will persist,” the traders maintained.

7,Drive kicks off to secure Nur Khan Airbase,Rawalpindi admin constitutes teams comprising PAF officers,"The Rawalpindi district administration has initiated a crackdown on aerial disturbances near the Nur Khan Airbase, targeting activities such as pigeon flying, kite flying, and aerial firing.
This action comes in response to stringent directives from sensitive institutions.
A high-level committee, comprising key officers from various institutions, has been established for conducting daily operations. This committee includes representatives from the Pakistan Air Force, local police units including the special branch and female police personnel, as well as officials from the district council and Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation. Heading this committee is District Officer Civil Defense Talib Hussain.
The operational team comprises five armed police personnel and ten civil defense uniformed personnel. Their recent operation around the air base involved dismantling pigeon houses and large iron nets from rooftops in eleven houses, along with confiscating pigeons.
While intermittent operations were previously conducted, the current directive mandates daily actions. The committee is authorised to enter properties where rooftop pigeon nets obstruct entry, with the female police facilitating access if necessary.
Talib Hussain, the committee's chairperson, confirmed that this operation marks the second phase, following a prior warning issued before Ramazan for residents to remove pigeon nets within a month. Failure to comply now results in severe penalties, including up to six months' imprisonment and fines reaching Rs0.2 million.
The presence of pigeon flying, kite flying, and aerial firing poses risks to aircraft and helicopter operations at the air base, necessitating a ban within five kilometers of the landing and take-off zones.
The recent operation targeted areas adjacent to the airbase, including Chah Sultan and Rawal Road. The agenda includes operations in Jahaz Ground, Dhok Laliyal, and Gangal Shakrial, as the authorities continue their efforts to mitigate these hazards and ensure aviation safety around the Nur Khan Air Base.

8,Motorway hit-and-run drama ends in arrest,Local court sends female driver who hit cop to jail on judicial remand,"A local court sent a female car driver, who sped away after hitting a motorway police officer while issuing a fine ticket at the Motorway Toll Plaza Islamabad on January 1, to jail on a 14-day judicial remand on Thursday.
Earlier, the Rawalpindi police dramatically apprehended the suspect and seized her vehicle. The prompt police action came soon after the circulation of a viral video depicting the event on social media.
Civil Judge Dr Muhammad Mumtaz Hanjara rejected the request of the investigation team for a five-day physical remand of the arrested Farah Zahira of Gulberg and sent her to Adiala jail on judicial remand. The court declared that the physical remand of the woman could not be given based on the voice-matching test of the accused. However, the investigation officer could interrogate the suspect at the jail in the presence of a woman policeman and a senior jail official. In the case of the voice-matching test, the police would be bound to transport the woman outside the jail after sunrise and bring her back before sunset. 
The judge remarked that he was not only a police officer but the state in uniform. “The Chief Justice of Pakistan has also said that the uniformed officers standing on the road are the state. This cannot be allowed under any circumstances,” he further remarked. 
At the outset of the hearing, the judge inquired the accused about her education and profession. She said that she has a PhD in international relations. To which the judge said she could not be expected to behave like that.
Sub Inspector Muhammad Afzal took a stand that the incident took place on January 1 and the accused was arrested on April 24. The accused, Farah Zahira daughter of Muzaffar Hussain started arguing with the officials when she was stopped for overspeeding. She also could not produce driving license and registration documents for her vehicle. When the police were about to issue her a fine ticket, the suspect drove the car intending to murder uniformed policeman Muhammad Sabir. The police sought a five-day remand of the accused to recover driving licence and registration documents and the sound-matching test of the video that became viral on social media.

Advocate Shah Khawar, who represented the accused in the court, said that every uniformed person is respectable and the incident should not have happened. The police remained silent for 112 days but had to arrest the woman after the video of the incident went viral on social media, he added. The lawyer stated that the woman accused could not be physically remanded. “She is an educated woman and her action does not constitute murder. We are ready to be involved in the investigation.”
The lawyer pleaded for the judicial remand. After hearing cross-arguments, the judge rejected the police plea for physical remand and ordered her medical examination from the headquarters hospital and to produce her in court on May 9. The judge further ordered the Adiala Jail Superintendent to take steps for the investigation process and the investigation team to submit a challan after completing the inquiry.
Earlier the suspect was brought to the court from the police station under tight security. She was also declared healthy after a medical examination at the district headquarters hospital.
Soon after the incident, the woman changed her getup to avoid arrest and also changed her mobile phone number and phone set. According to the video footage, the woman driver is seen being stopped by motorway police officers for speeding and asked to present her documents and pay the fine. In response, the woman is initially polite, saying she doesn't have the money and then suddenly reacts aggressively, breaking through the barrier of the motorway toll plaza and severely injuring the standing motorway police officer by running him over, before fleeing the scene.
The Naseerabad police registered a case on the complaint of the motorway police for resistance and negligent driving. The motorway police, however, remained silent after the incident. When the video of the incident came to light, Rawalpindi SSP Operations Kamran Asghar took notice and formed a police team which tracked the woman through vehicle numbers and official data. The police team aided by the ladies' police spotted her car in the Islamabad club and later caught her when she left the club for Rawalpindi. The police later added the provisions of attempted murder and injury in the FIR.
