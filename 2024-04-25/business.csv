0,T-bills more attractive bet than equities,Foreign investment in bonds reaches $20m in first nine days of April.,"KARACHI: Domestic bonds have proven more attractive to foreign investors than the record-breaking equity market during the first nine days of the current month. 
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Wednesday that foreign investments in treasury bills up to April 9 amounted to $20 million, surpassing the inflow for equities. 
This scenario is noteworthy since the equity market boom has attracted both domestic and foreign investors, yet treasury bill inflows in April remain higher. Over the nine days of April, the inflow for the equity market was $16.9 million. 
The shift was particularly notable in the second half of the current fiscal year when foreign investors turned towards domestic bonds. Treasury bills offer up to a 21 per cent return, making them highly attractive to both domestic and foreign investors.

Foreign investment in bonds reaches $20m in first nine days of April

Bankers attribute the influx of foreign investment in treasury bills to stability in the exchange rate. They noted that the highest inflows in T-bills occurred after the emergence of Covid-19 in 2019, when more than $4 billion returned to their origin. Since then, investors have remained cautious, but uncertainties on the political and economic fronts have also played a key role in keeping foreign investors away from the bonds market.
During July-April 9, FY24, total inflows in T-bills reached $183.6m, with most coming in the second half of the current financial year. Domestic financial institutions and the corporate sector have invested about Rs4.8 trillion in government bonds so far. The cut-off yield has remained around 21pc, indicating no signs of an interest rate cut in the next monetary policy.
SBP data shows that inflows during July-April 9, FY24 for the equity market amounted to $360.6m, maintaining the equity market at record levels. International rating agencies have yet to improve the country’s rating since its degradation during the current fiscal year. 
Bankers believe that positive economic developments, particularly constructive talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), could attract more foreign investment in domestic bonds. 
Pakistan expects final approval for the third tranche of $1.1bn of the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. 
Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, who led the delegation to Washington to negotiate with the IMF, expressed hope for new loan from the IMF, with another meeting expected in May this year.
Bankers suggest that if the interest rate is slashed by 100 to 200 basis points in the next monetary policy, 
the cut-off yield on domestic bonds would remain attractive to foreign investors. Stable exchange rates are also required to maintain investment attractiveness, they added.

1,Sugar prices surge amid reports of export ‘permission’,"KWGA chairman warns the government not to yield to millers’ pressure, otherwise, sugar exports will result in a sharp spike in local prices.","KARACHI: Domestic sugar prices have risen by Rs10 to Rs150-150 per kg in different parts of the country amid reports that the government is under pressure from millers to allow the export of one million to 1.5 million tonnes of the commodity.
Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA) Chairman Rauf Ibrahim said the wholesale price jumped Rs7-8 per kg in the last 10 days to Rs138-139 per kg on reports about likely permission for sugar exports.
He warned the government not to yield to millers’ pressure; otherwise, sugar exports would result in a sharp spike in local prices.
He said the price of sugar also rose by Rs10 per kg in Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Lahore.
Pakistan had ample stock with carryover from last year, and there is no need to create a panic-like situation by allowing sugar exports.
Mr Rauf recalled that consumers paid up to Rs185 per kg last year in the retail markets due to a demand-supply gap caused by sugar hoarding and smuggling.
Surprisingly, the wholesale and retail prices fixed by the Commissioner Karachi are Rs123 and Rs130 per kg, respectively, which the consumers hardly find at any shops.
Pakistan’s sugar exports stood at 33,101 tonnes ($21 million) during 9MFY24 compared to $172,182 tonnes ($83m) in the same period last fiscal year.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting with the stakeholders on Tuesday to discuss sugar exports, domestic requirements, and preventing future shortages.
The meeting also discussed steps against sugar hoarding and smuggling, as well as a crackdown to combat a shortage in the market and an artificial price hike.
Millers were of the view that sugar surplus stocks stand at 1.5-1.6m tonnes, which should be exported to fetch foreign exchange.
They have also asked the government to allow exports in phases — one million tonnes in the first phase and the rest by May and June.

2,Regulator approves Rs392bn investment plan for K-Electric,The approval comes almost one and a half years after the privatised entity sought Rs484bn worth of a seven-year investment plan.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday approved a Rs392 billion investment plan for K-Electric’s transmission and distribution network to reduce system losses and meet demand growth over the next seven years.
Under the decision, the Karachi-based private power utility has been allowed to invest over Rs238bn in the transmission network, Rs137bn in the distribution network, and another Rs17bn in related support systems like defence, cybersecurity, information technology, resource planning, etc., from FY24 to FY30.
The approval comes almost one and a half years after the privatised entity sought Rs484bn worth of a seven-year investment plan, on which the regulator conducted a public hearing on March 1, 2023.
Nepra, in its decision, noted that the KE took the stance that subsidy was the government’s prerogative and dependent on multiple factors. The KE said that its claimed investment of Rs484bn would result in a Rs3.2 per unit increase in tariff based on an exchange rate of Rs206 to a dollar on account of Rs1.9 per unit in transmission tariff and Rs1.3 per unit in distribution tariff. While the investment has been reduced from Rs484bn to Rs392bn, the exchange rate has since deteriorated to Rs280 per dollar. “Since there is a uniform tariff in the country, thus the subsidy will be impacted. However, this issue will be discussed and finalised during the proceedings of supply tariff,” the regulator noted.
The investment plan involves 14 growth projects to meet the future load growth of the customers at total cost of Rs120bn in Multi-year Tariff (MYT) control period from FY24 to FY30. Out of this total amount, Rs80bn has been allowed against KE’s claim for Rs85bn for the growth projects related to grid stations. Another Rs41bn has been allowed for transmission lines for growth against a claim of Rs55bn.
This would involve adding 450km of transmission lines, 13 new grid stations, and enhancing the transformation capacity to 755MVA (megavolte amperes) at the 132 kV voltage level and 3,800MVA at the 220 kV and above voltage level.
KE had claimed customs duties at the rate of 15pc on the foreign cost component (FCC) of the transmission projects which was reduced to 8pc by Nerpa in line with past precedents in the case of 660 kV high voltage transmission line from Matiari to Lahore. The custom duties shall be allowed as per actual, subject to the certification and third-party audit to be provided by KE.
Likewise, KE had claimed the cost of interest during construction (lDC) at 20pc, which was accepted by Nepra on provisional basis. However, it held that IDC shall be allowed only for the allowed completion period and shall be worked out based on the cost of debt, to be allowed in the tariff determination.
Loss reduction
On the distribution side, Nepra allowed the biggest chunk, Rs43bn, of the total Rs137bn investment to be spent on energy loss reduction, followed by Rs30bn for distribution network maintenance and Rs29bn for distribution growth. About Rs20bn would be spent on distribution safety.
Nepra noted that most of the growth projects on the transmission side were primarily demand-driven projects, as KE had estimated a yearly demand growth rate of 2.4pc to justify the proposed investment. According to KE, if the demand turned out to be higher or lower than expected, the timing of these projects would need to be adjusted to match the actual demand to ensure that the resources were used efficiently and the customers were not burdened with the cost of non-utilisation of assets.

3,MCB Bank profit increases 27pc,The board declares an interim cash dividend of Rs9 per share for the quarter.,"KARACHI: MCB Bank on Wednesday reported a 27 per cent increase in its profit-after-tax (PAT) to Rs16.6 billion translating into earnings per share (EPS) of Rs13.97 in the first quarter of the current calendar 2024.
The board of directors, in its meeting, under the chairmanship of Mian Mohammad Mansha, reviewed the bank’s performance and approved the condensed interim financial statements for the first quarter ended March 31.
The board declared an interim cash dividend of Rs9 per share for the quarter.
“Through focused efforts of the bank’s management in maintaining no-cost deposits base and optimising its earning assets mix, profit before tax increased to Rs32.5bn in the quarter with an impressive growth of 41pc,” the bank said in a press release.
Non-markup income increased 54pc to Rs9.1bn against Rs5.9bon in the corresponding period last year with major contributions coming in from fee commission income jumped 46pc to Rs6.1bn, income from dealing in foreign currency surged 97pc to Rs1.9bn and dividend income rose 55pc to Rs1bn during the quarter.
Bank Alfalah earns Rs10bn
Bank Alfalah Ltd (BAFL) announced PAT of Rs9.95bn with an EPS of Rs6.31 for the first quarter of CY24. This reflects a decrease of 8pc year-on-year but an increase of 10pc quarter-on-quarter.
Higher operating expenses and interest expenses dragged down overall profitability on a year-over-year basis. However, lower income was the primary factor affecting profitability on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As a result, the bank announced a cash dividend of Rs2 per share.
Allied Bank profit surges
Allied Bank Ltd (ABL) reported PAT of Rs11.6bn and EPS at Rs10.14 for 1QCY24, an increase of 51pc year-on-year. However, quarter-on-quarter, it was down 5pc (4QCY23 EPS: Rs10.7).
The decrease in earnings QoQ was mainly attributed to reduced markup and non-markup income. However, on a YoY basis, higher income and provisioning reversals contributed to an increase in overall profitability.

4,Dairy exports to China on the cards,"Agriculture deemed important for Pakistan's growing population, says IFC's Principal Country Officer Naz Khan.","LAHORE: Pakistan will soon start exporting dairy products to China through a state-of-the-art farm developed in Sheikhupura, says Punjab Livestock Secretary Masaud Anwar.
Speaking at the Pakistan Agricultural Coalition’s Agri-Connections 2024 Expo on Wednesday, he said a team from China Customs recently visited the farm and unofficially approved dairy imports from Pakistan.
Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Sahoo said the incumbent government would invest Rs100 billion in the agriculture sector in two years, while Rs80 billion was additionally earmarked to modernise watercourses in three years. Faisalabad Agriculture University Vice-Chancellor Dr Iqrar Ahmad urged the private sector to invest in high-efficiency irrigation.
International Finance Corporation’s Principal Country Officer Naz Khan cautioned that by 2050, Pakistan’s population would be 400 million, so the agriculture sector was very important for meeting food needs.

5,‘IMF surcharges on borrowings exacerbate global inequities’,"Countries such as Ukraine, Egypt, Argentina, Barbados and Pakistan pay the most in surcharges, the report shows.","BENGALURU: Countries, mostly middle and lower-income, have been burdened by surcharges on top of interest payments on their borrowings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), widening global inequities, according to a report by US think tanks.
Indebted member countries paid about $6.4 billion in surcharges between 2020-2023, the report from Boston University’s Global Development Policy Centre and Columbia University’s Initiative for Policy Dialogue released on Tuesday showed.
And the number of countries paying these surcharges has more than doubled in the last four years.
The IMF is expected to charge an estimated $9.8 billion in surcharges in the next five years, according to an earlier report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
Critics of the policy argue that surcharges do not hasten repayment and instead punish countries already struggling with liquidity constraints, increase the risk of debt distress and divert scarce resources that could be used to boost the struggling economies.
Countries such as Ukraine, Egypt, Argentina, Barbados and Pakistan pay the most in surcharges, the report showed, accounting for 90 per cent of the IMF’s surcharge revenues.
These surcharges, levied on top of the fund’s increasingly steeper basic rate, are IMF’s single largest source of revenue, accounting for 50pc of total revenue in 2023.
“IMF surcharges are inherently pro-cyclical as they increase debt service payments when a borrowing country is most need of emergency financing,” Global Development Policy Center’s director Kevin Gallagher said.
“Increasing surcharges and global shocks are compounding the economic pressure on vulnerable countries.”
Data published by the Institute of International Finance earlier this year showed global debt levels hit a record of $313 trillion in 2023, while the debt-to-GDP ratio — a reading indicating a country’s ability to pay back debts — across emerging economies also scaled fresh peaks.IMF shareholders agreed last week on the importance of addressing challenges faced by low-income countries, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday.

6,"Propelled by economic optimism, index crosses 72,000 barrier","KARACHI: Bulls roared back on Wednesday amid growing optimism about an improved economic outlook, lifting the...","


 
KARACHI: Bulls roared back on Wednesday amid growing optimism about an improved economic outlook, lifting the benchmark KSE 100 index to its highest-ever closing above 72,000.
Arif Habib Ltd’s Head of Research Tahir Abbas, talking to Dawn, said the attractive share valuations were fuelling the bull run at the PSX. 
“Despite the fact the market rallied 65 per cent in the last nine months since June 2023 to an all-time high above 72,000 on Wednesday, it is still trading at a historic-low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 4.4 compared to the average multiple of 6x in the last five years.
The reason for the low P/E multiple is the significant growth in the profitability of listed companies, whereas their scrip prices have not risen by the same quantum. “Resultantly, the cheapest valuations have attracted huge buying interest, especially from foreign investors,  triggering a bull run at the stock market in recent months,” Mr Tahir explained while outrightly rejecting the impression that a bubble was in the making.
He also said the economy is in the stabilisation phase, and the measures taken by both the caretaker and the new governments have broadly steered the economy in the right direction, leading to the restoration of investor confidence.
The successful completion of the short-term $3bn Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), with the disbursement of the last tranche of $1.1bn likely this month, and the beginning of talks with the International Monetary Fund for another larger and longer Extended Fund Facility boosted economic outlook.
Obviously, an improvement in the major economic indicators does not emerge in a single month, but the $613m current account surplus and a sharp deceleration in inflation to 20.7pc in March, which is expected to be below 17pc in the ongoing month, were significant developments that would pave the way for a cut in the interest rate in the coming months. “These also contribute to the robust market momentum,” he remarked.
Predicting the surging momentum to continue, he estimated the market still has the potential to grow by 35 per cent from its current level.
Topline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Muha­mmad Suhail said the index reached another record high, mainly due to institutional buying.
“This surge, propelled by positive shifts in market sentiment in the back drop off anticipation in economic metrics such as foreign exchange reserves and inflation trends, has ignited expectations of forthcoming monetary easing,” Topline Securities Ltd said.
Various sectors, including cement, banking, power, and automobiles, contributed significantly to this ascent, with notable contributions from companies like Lucky Cement, Hub Power, Habib Bank Ltd, Millat Tractors Ltd and Systems Ltd, collectively adding 369 points. Conversely, profit-taking was observed in companies like Meezan Bank Ltd, Pakistan Tobacco Company and Pakistan Services Ltd, resulting in a cumulative loss of 85 points.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the finance minister’s affirmation that forex reserves will reach $9bn-$10bn by June and strong earnings in the banking sector played a catalyst role in the record close.
As a result, the index an intraday record at 72,414.32, gaining 1,055 points. However, it closed at 72,051.89 points after gaining 692.49 points, or 0.97pc from the preceding session.
