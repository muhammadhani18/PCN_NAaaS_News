0,IHC summons DC over ‘legality’ of Roti price cut,Plea challenges legality of notification whereby max price of Roti and Naan was slashed by over 36pc.,"ISLAMABAD: The tiff between the capital administration and the Naanbai association over the reduction in the price of Roti has landed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), with the court asking the deputy commissioner to appear before the bench on Thursday.
IHC Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri directed the deputy commissioner to appear in person on Thursday (today).
He was hearing the petition challenging the legality of government notification whereby the maximum price of Roti and Naan had been slashed by over 36pc. After hearing the preliminary arguments, the court admitted the petition for the hearing and asked the ICT administrator to appear before it within 24 hours.
 
 

As per the details, the Punjab government in April issued a notification slashing the price of Roti, followed by a similar notification by the ICT administration.
The Islamabad administration notification had set the price of Roti and Naan at Rs16 and Rs20, respectively. Just four months ago, the price was fixed at Rs25 (Roti) and Rs30 (Naan) respectively, as per the petitioner. This decision was challenged by the Capital Naanbai Association, a union comprising over 3,000 tandoors in Islamabad. The petitioners were represented by the Barrister Umer Ijaz Gilani.
During the proceeding, Justice Jahangiri asked why the petitioner assailed the notification even though it seemed to be for the benefit of the general public. Responding to the query, Barrister Gilani submitted that no subsidy mechanism had been implemented in the matter in line with flour prices. In the current scenario, more than 3,000 tandoors in the capital territory are facing financial loss due to a cut in reasonable profit, the lawyer added.
The counsel further contended that without legal authority, the district magistrate issued the notification on April 15, 2024, while exercising powers under Section 3 of the Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977. He pointed out that Section 3 of the act only authorised the federal government to issue such a notification. Barrister Gilani urged the court to set aside the notification because an “incompetent authority” had issued this order.
After a brief hearing, the bench issued an order, issuing notice to the DC. “Points raised need consideration. Notice to the respondents. [The] deputy commissioner…is directed to depute a senior law-knowing officer, well conversant with facts of the case to appear, in person, along with record in order to assist the court on the next date of hearing.”
The additional attorney general and the Islamabad advocate general were also directed to depute “law-knowing officers” to appear, in person, to assist the court.
Later, the matter was adjourned for Thursday (today).

1,CDA seeks cabinet’s nod for two new luxury hotels in capital,Three plans to be placed before federal cabinet for the best possible option.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal capital is likely to house two more five-star hotels as the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has moved a summary seeking the federal cabinet’s approval for the construction of these hotels in Sector F-5.
Sources in the interior ministry said the summary was prepared by the CDA in light of a decision taken in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday. They added the civic agency would prepare three frameworks in this regard that would be placed before the cabinet to have its pick.
The summary was moved via the interior ministry for its onward submission to the federal cabinet. The CDA was also asked to include advantages and drawbacks for every framework so that the executive could pick a suitable model. Sources said that three options were going to be placed before the federal cabinet: freehold rights, public-private partnership mode, and leasehold rights.
 
 

They added that there was a dire need for new luxury hotels in Islamabad as merely 4,000 rooms per night were available in Islamabad while the demand for the rooms exceeded over 8,000 rooms.

Three plans to be placed before federal cabinet for the best possible option

Sources said Plot No. 6 near the Pakistan National Arts Council (PNCA) measuring 4.51 acres and Plot No. 8 measuring 3.73 acres (back side of Marriot Hotel) are cumulatively worth Rs20 billion. Both pieces of land hold significant promise for the development of upscale hospitality offerings since they are located next to the key administrative headquarters and offices of government entities.
They said that the proximity of both plots to the Diplomatic Enclave accentuates their suitability for luxury hotel development, meeting the needs of diplomats and high-profile visitors. “Islamabad’s role as the gateway to the country’s northern areas ensures a consistent flow of tourists, underscoring the urgency to address the scarcity of high-end accommodations,” said sources, adding that there were only two five-star hotels in the city.
Additionally, the picturesque location of both plots, coupled with their easy accessibility, promises high turnover potential, the sources said, adding, “Luxury hotels are esteemed as enduring assets, with an anticipated return period of 8-9 years and minimal depreciation, affirming the long-term viability of this venture.”
It is relevant to note that the CDA had tried to auction the said plots several times but failed as the approval of the cabinet was mandatory to put these plots up for auction. Last year, one of the plots was part of the auction list, but the CDA had to withdraw it at the eleventh hour because the cabinet was not consulted.
However, this time the CDA and the federal government are “on one page” regarding these plots.
According to insiders, there are chances that a foreign country, particularly Saudi Arabia, will invest in this project as the Saudi government plans to pump up to $5 billion into the national economy.
Recently, a high-powered Saudi delegation led by the Kingdom’s foreign minister also visited Pakistan aimed at enhancing bilateral economic cooperation and pushing forward previously agreed investment deals.

2,"Petition against ban on kite-flying, pigeon homing, firing in air dismissed",RAWALPINDI: Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawalpindi bench on Wednesday dismissed the petition against the ban imposed on...,"RAWALPINDI: Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawalpindi bench on Wednesday dismissed the petition against the ban imposed on kite-flying, pigeon homing and firing in jubilation.
LHC Justice Jawad Hassan dismissed the petition observing “The Court is expected to enforce fundamental rights reasonably and not in a manner which creates hurdles and unnecessary complications.”
The petitioner Mehtab Ahmed challenged the ban imposed on kite flying as well as on pigeon homing and firing in the air near the airbase.
The counsel for the petitioner argued that the main grievance of his client was to the extent of ban on pigeon homing, which is a hobby of distinct nature and cannot be harmful for human life.
He further submitted that it is the cultural right of the petitioner to fly pigeon and he is also earning money from this hobby, therefore, his fundamental right of livelihood as guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution, has been infringed upon.
At this juncture, law officer of the government has objected to the maintainability of this petition by relying on the dictum laid down by the LHC Rawalpindi bench in the case of Syed Faisal Mehboob versus Federation of Pakistan in which issue regarding construction of highrise buildings within the limits of the New Islamabad International Airport was raised and the court while exercising the Doctrine of Judicial Restraint, restrained the authority concerned from passing any injunctive order for the welfare of the country, national security and the safety of lives of millions of the people.
In response, Malik Akhtar Ijaz Awan, counsel for the petitionerreiterated his aforesaid submissions but he added that the petitioner would be satisfied if the matter be referred to the Commissioner, Rawalpindi Division  to decide the same in accordance with law within a shortest possible time.
The court perused the relevant judgements and noted that “the High Court appears to have arbitrarily interfered in a policy matters which it should have been reluctant to do considering that such matters concern complex factors which have a direct impact on the economy of the country. … The responsibility of the Court is limited to legal interpretation.”
He observed that “the Court is expected to enforce fundamental rights reasonably and not in a manner which creates hurdles and unnecessary complications.…”
“Moreover, the scope of the Doctrine of Judicial Estoppel has further been strengthened by this Court in the cases of Mohammad Umais versus Cantonment Board Rawalpindi and others… by setting certain principles on judicial restraint” said the court order.
Subsequently, the court ruled: “In view of the principles already settled by this Court in the cases cited above, no direction can be issued to Respondent No.2 [commissioner] as prayed for by learned counsel for the Petitioner.”
However, the Petitioner may, on his own move, approach the authority concernedfor the redressal of his grievance and if he do so, then the matter will, of course, be decided by the said authority strictly as per law within a timely fashion, the court order said.
Justice Hassan finally declared the petition as not maintainable and dismissed it accordingly.

3,CJP urged to form larger bench to hear cases of civilians held in military custody,ISLAMABAD: PTI and family members of the prisoners demanded of the Supreme Court (SC) and chief justice of Pakistan...,"ISLAMABAD: PTI and family members of the prisoners demanded of the Supreme Court (SC) and chief justice of Pakistan to immediately constitute a larger bench to hear the cases of the civilians held in military custody to ensure their earliest release because civilians’ trials in military courts was “unconstitutional and unlawful”.
They were of the view that their loved ones should be tried in civilian courts and must be given full chance of fair trial, as in the military courts they were being subjected to mental torture to make them patients because they were deprived of all prisoners’ rights.
Addressing a press conference along with PTI Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan, Barrister Abuzar Salman Niazi, former Chief minister Gilgit-Baltistan Khalid Khursheed and family members of the civilians who are in military custody, PTI senior leader Ali Mohammad Khan, who was the head of the PTI prisoners committee, said that the civilians detained under the guise of May 9 incidents had been facing military trial for the last over one year.
He said that majority of the detainees were well-educated and sole bread earners of their respective families but they were implicated in cases, which seemed nothing but a war of ego, because those who were convinced to address press conferences were given clean chit in all serious cases.
Ali Mohammad stated that all legal fraternity irrespective of political affiliation were unanimous on the point that civilian trials in military courts was unconstitutional and unlawful because they limited the sources of fair trials and justice, which one could get in the civil courts.
The PTI leader demanded CJP to form a larger bench to decide whether cases of these prisoners could be tried in the military courts in order to ensure early release of these citizens so they could serve the country because decisions had already been given against some detainees.
Ali Mohammad stressed the need that they should be given the chance to prove their innocence.
Speaking on the occasion, Barrister Abuzar Salman Niazi categorically stated that the military courts were unconstitutional because it was against the article 175 of the Constitution as the same institution was working as judge, jury and executive so how it could do justice.
Abuzar reminded that the military courts gave verdicts against the civilians within four days, which was unprecedented and how it could be called a fair trial.
He stated that the names of a five-member SC bench — comprising Justices Ijazul Ahsan, Munib Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Syed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and Ayesha Malik, who had unanimously declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts was ultra vires the Constitution, would be remembered in golden word in history.
Senior lawyer pointed out that the incumbent CJP’s legacy was questionable due to his decision of depriving PTI of its electoral symbol bat.
Speaking on the occasion, Sidra Murtaza, whose brother was in military custody, narrated the ordeals her family members being passed through since the detention of her brother in May 9 related incidents.
She demanded of the apex court to form a larger bench to hear the case of the civilians being tried in military courts, as family members of these civilians were suffering from various ailments and some had even passed away due to mental stress and agony.
Sidra urged CJP and COAS to meet them as they were patriotic Pakistanis and detained under some misunderstanding as they did nothing wrong because the country’s constitution guaranteed its citizens the right of a peaceful protest.

4,Canada to support women’s healthcare in Pakistan: envoy,TAXILA: Canadian High Commissioner Leslie Scanlon has said that Canada will continue its support for Pakistan in...,"TAXILA: Canadian High Commissioner Leslie Scanlon has said that Canada will continue its support for Pakistan in healthcare and social development, particularly focusing on the welfare of women.
Ms Scanlon was addressing as chief guest at the inauguration ceremony of a hospital established by Pakistani-born Canadian nationals Parvez Khan and Aqeel Khan in collaboration with ‘Refugee Girl’, a Canadian-based NGO in Khora Khel village in Hazro.
She said the Canadian government was committed to women’s empowerment, recognising the crucial role they played in society, and ensuring their access to healthcare opportunities for their personal and professional growth.
“Gender equality is not only a basic human right but also a driver for sustainable development and prosperity for all,” Ms Scanlon said.
While mentioning the relations between Pakistan and Canada in the field of healthcare and social development, the Canadian high commissioner said: “... Canada was the first sovereign donor for the eradication of polio for Pakistan, and this cooperation spans over 70 years of long-term committed partnership.”
She said the Canadian government, through the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), successfully launched the ‘Healthy Families’ project for Pakistan aimed at enhancing the reproductive health and rights of women, adolescents and youth in areas with poor reproductive health indicators.
Ms Scanlon said that the project seeks to empower them to exercise their reproductive rights without coercion or discrimination, besides providing access to safe, effective, and affordable family planning methods and appropriate healthcare services for safe pregnancies and childbirth.
She added that the project aimed to tackle gender and social obstacles while also empowering communities with maternal, neonatal, child health, and family planning services.
The Canadian diplomat reaffirmed her commitment to remain constructively engaged in further reinforcing bilateral relations, as there were a number of sectors that had huge potential for cooperation, especially social development, women’s empowerment, and the health sector.
She praised Mr Parvez and his family for providing better health care facilities to the people in rural areas, adding that the medical center, more than a building, symbolises a better future for the people, particularly women and girls, as otherwise access to better health services is a dream for them.

PRA issued show-cause notices to restaurants, marriage halls and hotels located in Rawalpindi district.
A total of 40 restaurants, including Saffron, Mikong, Saffilo, Altaf Restaurant, Al-Sheikh Tikka, Kentucky, Red Onion, Mian Jee Restaurant, Butt Karahi, Data Kabana, Rahat Café, Khyber Shinwari, Shensha Tikka, and others, had filed separate petitions against the PRA notices.
The notices were issued under Section 24(2) of the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012, by the additional commissioner, Punjab Revenue Authority, finance department, Government of Punjab.
Counsel for the petitioners argued that the restaurants, hotels and marriage halls were taxpayers and had regularly been paying taxes, but the estimate given was based on assumptions, which was contrary to the data already provided by the petitioners in their returns under Section 35 of the Act.
Counsel for the PRA, on the other hand, filed reports and parawise comments and defended the impugned notices by stating that the same had been issued due to concealment of sales and short payments of tax due.
Subsequently, the court ruled that the “impugned notices” are without the strength of due inquiry, and the petitioners have not been afforded the opportunity of hearing, and the objections raised by them in their respective replies have not been given due consideration.
Justice Hassan ruled: “Therefore, the “impugned notices” cannot be allowed to breathe in the field anymore. Consequently, all the writ petitions are allowed, and the “impugned notices” are hereby set aside.”

Speaking during his meeting with American Ambassador Donald Blome, Mr Gilani stressed the need for increased cooperation to boost trade volume.
He welcomed the US ambassador to the Parliament House for a constructive dialogue aimed at strengthening bilateral relations and fostering mutual interests.
Recognising the significant economic partnership between the two countries, the Senate chairman highlighted the US as Pakistan’s largest trading partner and expressed his gratitude to the American government for its collaboration in various sectors.
Mr Gilani also advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that “it is high time for peace in Palestine and a need for a ceasefire in Gaza”.
During the meeting, both sides engaged in detailed deliberations on various aspects of the enduring friendship between Pakistan and the United States. Ambassador Blome also congratulated Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on being elected as the Senate chairman and wished him a successful tenure.
The challenges faced by students and businessmen in obtaining US visas were also discussed in the meeting. Ambassador Blome acknowledged Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts and reiterated US support in combating terrorism, recognising the significant impact of terrorism on the country.
In a statement issued by the Senate, Yousaf Raza Gilani expressed Pakistan’s commitment to nurturing its long-standing friendly ties with the US and emphasised the importance of further promoting parliamentary relations between the two nations.
Both also discussed the importance of parliamentary contacts, with the Senate chairman appreciating the fact that a strong Parliamentary Caucus existed in the US Congress for promotion of bilateral ties.
“We are in the process of reconstituting the friendship group as a consequence of the recent Senate elections. 
This would help promote mutually beneficial ties and give parliamentary diplomacy a chance to build strong people-to-people contacts,” Mr Gilani said.
Ambassador Donald Blome commended the new economic team and expressed optimism regarding the ongoing discussions between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
He praised the efforts of the Pakistani economic team and emphasised the potential for further cooperation between Pakistan and the US.

He also highlighted the flourishing gaming industry in Pakistan and called for enhanced cooperation in the digital sector.
World Malaria Day
Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani has said that he stood with the global community in Pakistan’s commitment to eradicate malaria once and for all.
“Malaria continues to devastate communities around the world, particularly in regions where access to healthcare and resources is limited,” Mr Gilani said in a message on Wednesday.
World Malaria Day, observed annually on April 25, serves as a reminder of the imperative to unite in raising awareness and finding effective solutions to combat malaria in areas where it remained endemic.
Malaria was a preventable and treatable disease, but its control required collaborative efforts from all stakeholders.
The Senate chairman reaffirmed his dedication to supporting research, funding and initiatives aimed at combating this deadly disease, adding that, “we recognise the importance of collaboration between governments, organisations and individuals to implement effective prevention and treatment strategies”.

Jazba Shafi, a range officer in the AJK wildlife and fisheries department, told Dawn that they came to know from multiple sources on Wednesday morning that the body of a leopard, zoologically known as Panthera Pardus, was lying along a link road to Batangi village.
The link road stems from the main Neelum valley road before the town of Patikka, some 18km northeast of here.
“Our staff went to the area and conducted preliminary investigations with the local population about the killer(s) of the big cat, but to no avail,” she said.
Ms Shafi said the postmortem examination conducted by a veterinary officer in Patikka revealed that the one-year-old female leopard had been killed with three deep gunshots.
Since the blood was still oozing from the deep wounds, it meant the big cat had been shot sometime between Tuesday and Wednesday night, she added.
Ms Shafi said the FIR was registered at police post Patikka on her complaint under sections 10(ii) and (iv) of the AJK Wildlife Protection Act, 2014. “Now our staff and police will jointly investigate to unearth the person(s) involved in the killing of the leopard,” she said.
