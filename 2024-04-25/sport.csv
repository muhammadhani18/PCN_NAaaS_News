0,FIH gives one-day ultimatum to PHF over parallel bodies,"Amid internal wrangling within the Pakistan hockey Federation, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) gives a brief yet sombre message to the federation.","LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: It is no good news for Pakistan hockey which is already struggling badly for survival while facing crises and setbacks of all kinds. 
Amid internal wrangling within the Pakistan hockey Federation, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) on Wednesday gave a brief yet sombre message to the federation which has witnessed a growing tussle for control between two rival groups in recent months.
In a letter written to the PHF, the FIH has set April 25 (today) as the deadline for Pakistan to determine one genuine body which can properly represent the country at the international level. Other­wise, the world governing body added, that Pakistan’s participation in the forthcoming Sultan Azlan Shah Cup (May 4-11, Malaysia) and the Nations Cup (May 31-June 9, Poland), will remain in question.
The FIH gave the ruling after the Azlan Shah Cup organisers asked for guidance from the international body after two rival groups in Pakistan hockey — one headed by Tariq Hussain Bugti and the other by Shehla Raza — contacted the hosts for sending their teams to represent Pakistan.
Bugti was nominated by interim prime minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar while Shehla was nominated by PM Shehbaz. 
“It is imperative that the situation is resolved [within the PHF] by the end of this week and it is determined who will be sending the teams to the upcoming tournaments. We request that the agreed outcome and details of the official representatives are clearly communicated to us, FIH, by the end of the day on Friday [April 25],” the FIH letter to the PHF said.
“Failure to reach an agreement between the two [rival] parties by this time will mean we will have no choice but to write to the Pakistan government or the Pakistan Olympic Association, requesting their intervention and resolution,” added the letter.
“For clarity, allowing one of these organisations to send a team to these tournaments [in Malaysia and Poland] will not necessarily lead to automatic recognition of this group as the official Pakistan Hockey Federation.
“We will need to go through the correct process to recognise them. But the urgent priority for this [ongoing] week is to resolve the situation such that the Pakistan athletes are able to compete in these upcoming tournaments,” it concluded.
According to the FIH letter, Tayyab Ikram, who is a Pakistani and current president of the game’s world governing body, has been kept separate from the issue because of being a man of the country working in the senior management of the FIH which is dealing with PHF’s affairs.
Meanwhile disturbed over the prevailing situation, the government has summoned both the groups in Islamabad on Thursday to resolve the issues between them.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the PHF patron-in-chief, tasked the Adviser on Youth Affairs Rana Mashood to look into the matter. 
According to sources in the PHF, Mashood after listening to both the groups will decide the matter so that a strong and properly prepared national squad could be sent to Malaysia. 
However in a clear sign of heightened tensions between the said factions, the Shehla group has conveyed to the government that they will sit separately for the meeting where their rival group will not be sitting.
Haider Hussain, the secretary of Shehla-headed group within the federation, told Dawn on Wednesday that their group would not sit with the Bugti group in today’s meeting while claiming that some officials included in the Bugti group were facing corruption charges and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cases against them were in final stages.
“Yes in order to resolve the issues we are ready to sit with the government representative, Rana Mashood, but separately, as corruption cases involving some former Olympians, who part of the Bugti group, are being investigated,” Haider underlined.
Rana Mujahid, the secretary of the Bugti faction, claimed they were the genuine and legitimate body of the game in Pakistan.
“On Thursday, my group will present [the] evidence to prove before the FIH that we are a legitimate body to run the PHF,” Mujahid said.
“Bugti took the vote of confidence from the PHF Congress in a meeting where the representatives of the Pakistan Olympic Association and Pakistan Sports Board were also present,” he added.
Interestingly, Mujahid speaking on the occasion said that he would announce a five-member selection committee on April 27 to pick the national squad for next month’s Azlan Shah Cup.
This assertion signals that the training camp he had set up in Islamabad a week ago is running without selectors.
It may be mentioned that both the groups have set up training camps for the forthcoming event in Malaysia. Shehla group is running their camp in Karachi.
It is the first time that the PHF has explicitly split into two factions, after the POA and some other federations witnessed similar issues in the past.
Both the PHF groups held their Congress meeting separately last month to elect Bugti and Shehla as their president. In Karachi, Shehla was elected by Congress members belonging to Sindh and Balochistan, while in Islamabad Tariq was elected by the Congress, whose members are from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab hockey associations.
OLTMANS EYEING PRO LEAGUE QUALIFICATION
Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Roelant Oltmans said that his main target was to enable the team to qualify for the FIH Pro League. 
The Dutch coach who is in contract with the PHF for the events in Malaysia and Poland and is supervising the camp set up at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium for the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, said that he was working to improve fitness of the players. 
“We are concentrating on the job and my [primary] aim is to help Pakistan qualify for the Pro League. During the Azlan Shah Cup, the players will get a chance to improve their skills,” Oltmans said while adding that the national team required restructuring for which “there is a need to bring senior players”.
Oltmans emphasized that domestic hockey in Pakistan required attention and strong competitions at domestic level so that the game’s standard in the country could improve.
He said that any coach required ample time to develop a strong team and added that currently Pakistan had a number of talented players who could become stars in the future.
While 57 players are currently attending the camp in Islamabad, this strength is going to be reduced to 25. 
The Pakistan squad, to be selected in coming days, is likely to travel to Malaysia on May 1 to play their first match of the Azlan Shah Cup against the hosts on May 4.

1,Rizwan ruled out but Babar hopeful Pakistan will bounce back,Pakistan will also be without batter Irfan Khan Niazi due to injury.,"

PAKISTAN captain Babar Azam speaks during a press conference. —White Star

 
LAHORE: Pakistan will be missing one of their batting mainstays in the penultimate Twenty20 Intern­ational against New Zealand but the other, captain Babar Azam, was hopeful that his side will bounce back from their dispiriting loss in the last game by winning the five-match series. 
The series is level at 1-1 after depleted New Zealand, shorn of their big names due to their involvement in the Indian Premier League, stunned Pakistan by clinching the third game by seven wickets and now the hosts will also be missing one of their star players. 
Wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan, who alongside Babar is one of the key cogs of Pakistan’s top order, will be sitting out the last two matches of the series due to a hamstring injury sustained when the teams met last time out in Rawalpindi. 
Pakistan will also be without batter Irfan Khan Niazi due to injury with a Pakistan Cricket Board spokesperson announcing the injury absentees ahead of Babar’s pre-match news conference for Thursday’s fourth T20. 
“Injuries are part and parcel of the game,” Babar told reporters at the Gaddai Stadium on Wednesday. “But when you lose a top player like Rizwan, of course the team will miss him. Everyone has seen the way he has served Pakistan with his performances. 
“Thankfully Rizwan’s injury isn’t that serious and he’s being given rest to recover fully as we have more series to play before the T20 World Cup [in June].” 
The series against New Zealand is an opportunity for the Pakistan squad, featuring several new players, to gel into a winning combination ahead of the World Cup in the United States and the West Indies. 
Babar was reinstated as captain ahead of the series and stated he was hopeful his side would rebound in the series. 
“We lost the last match but we must be careful about pointing fingers at one or two players as the entire team lost the match,” he said. “We are playing as a team and if we had not wasted opportunities in the field the result would have been in our favour. 
“We will try not to repeat the past mistakes to win the remaining two matches to win the series.” 
He also backed Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah to show their true form after the duo were hit to all parts by the belligerent Mark Chapman in the last match; the New Zealand batter taking his side to victory.

Babar stressed that Pakistan will continue to rotate their players for the rest of the series, adding that all the players were on board with the team management. 
“We’re trying to give everyone a chance,” he said. “We’re also trying to give our bench strength chances to play so that we have everyone in top shape for the World Cup. We’re testing different combinations and there is always proper communication by the team management whenever a player is being dropped.” 
New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell, meanwhile, said that the Black Caps had been buoyed by their victory in the third T20. 
After the opening match of the series was washed out, Pakistan romped to victory in the second game and Bracewell said that his team’s “confidence had been restored” after their victory in the last game. 
“The playing conditions are different in Pakistan and we always learn something while playing here,” he added. “We might be without our big names but it’s a big opportunity for the younger players to express themselves in an international series. With Pakistan having all their big guns, it’s a great opportunity for our players to play against a tough side.”
Bracewell hailed Chapman for his sensational knock in the last match and said his side will continue to build on their victory. 
“We learnt from our loss against Pakistan in the second game as a batting unit and adjusted our game accordingly,” he said. “We are under no illusion that the last two games at the Gaddafi are going to be easy. We will keep focus on making adjustments and not resting on our laurels after winning the last game.”

2,Stoinis keen to represent Australia despite losing contract,NEW DELHI: Marcus Stoinis’s desire to keep playing international cricket beyond the T20 World Cup in June has not...,"NEW DELHI: Marcus Stoinis’s desire to keep playing international cricket beyond the T20 World Cup in June has not been diminished by Cricket Australia’s decision to drop him from the central contracts list, the all-rounder said.
Stoinis looks certain to be named in Australia’s squad for the World Cup in West Indies and the United States, and the Lucknow Super Giants batter provided a glimpse of his best form with a blistering hundred in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday.
The 34-year-old smashed an unbeaten 124 off 63 balls as Lucknow beat hosts Chennai Super Kings by six wickets to break into the top four in the points table.
Named Player of the Match, Stoinis did not want to describe his performance as a statement knock and said he had a great relationship with Australian coach Andrew McDonald.
“Me not getting a contract, I knew that a while ago,” Stoinis said after Lucknow’s fifth win in eight matches.
“I think it’s great to give younger kids a crack and let them take my spot. I’m absolutely fine with that on the contract list.
“But on the playing front, I still obviously want to make sure that I’m there, and that’s also why it’s so lucky for us and for me particularly to have this competition [the IPL]...
“I started my career pretty much here and who knows I finish it here.”
Stoinis was promoted to number three after Lucknow lost Quinton de Kock in the first over, allowing the Australian to pace his innings.
“In this competition, there are plenty of better opening batters than me, so I’ll let them do their job,” he said.

3,Bolt named T20 World Cup ambassador,"The announcement comes a few weeks ahead of the start of cricket’s biggest T20 spectacle ever that will inspire a new generation of fans, says an ICC press release.","DUBAI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has named Olympic legend Usain Bolt as an ambassador for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which will be played in the West Indies and US from June 1 to 29.
The announcement comes a few weeks ahead of the start of cricket’s biggest T20 spectacle ever that will inspire a new generation of fans, said an ICC press release.
Bolt’s global appeal alongside his out of this world athletic achievements and ability to transcend boundaries makes him a perfect fit for the biggest T20 World Cup ever.
The former Jamaican sprint giant created history at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro when he snatched three gold medals at three consecutive Olympics. His journey to worldwide stardom started at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing where he won the 100m, 200m and 4x100m, all in world record times.
Bolt currently holds world records in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m with times of 9.58 secs, 19.19 secs and 36.84 secs.
As an ambassador, Bolt would play a key role in promoting the event, starting with a cameo appearance in next week’s release of the events official anthem music video alongside iconic artists Sean Paul and Kes. 
Bolt expressed his excitement about his new role.
“Coming from the Caribbean where cricket is a part of life, the sport has always held a special place in my heart, and I look forward to attending West Indies matches at the World Cup and making a contribution to the growth of cricket globally,” the 37-year-old said.
“While I will of course be supporting West Indies at the World Cup, getting the sport into the US is big for cricket. Its the biggest sports market in the world and the energy that we will bring for the T20 World Cup is a huge opportunity leading towards crickets inclusion in the LA Olympics in 2028.”

5,Nadal uncertain over French Open appearance,"“If I was in Paris today, I wouldn’t go out to play,” Nadal tells a press conference.","MADRID: Spain’s Rafael Nadal said on Wednesday that he is not sure if he will be able to play at next month’s French Open after pushing through the pain barrier in his comeback from injury.
The 37-year-old, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, said that he is far from being in top form and that he is only playing against American Darwin Blanch in the first round of the Madrid Open on Thursday as a personal sacrifice.
“If I was in Paris today, I wouldn’t go out to play,” Nadal told a press conference, in reference to Roland Garros. “I don’t think I’ll be able to play at 100 per cent but it’s important to be able to play for the last time in Madrid, it means a lot to me to play on this court where I’ve had some great moments.
“This doesn’t mean I’m giving up on anything in the next few weeks, I don’t know what might happen…
“I’m going to do the things I have to do to be able to play in Paris. And if I can, I can and if I can’t, I can’t. I’m going to Paris if I feel like I’m good enough… if I feel capable enough to compete.”
Nadal, who has said he expects to retire after the 2024 season, returned to competition in Brisbane in January, after almost a year sidelined with a hip flexor injury.
However, after winning his first two matches in the tournament, Nadal lost in three sets to Australian Jordan Thompson in the quarter-finals.
The gruelling contest appeared to take its toll on the Spaniard who, trailing 1-4 in the final set, took a medical timeout to get treatment on his upper-left leg.
He did not play an ATP event until making a winning return last week in Barcelona, with a first round victory over Flavio Cobolli, only to fall a day later in a 7-5 6-1 second round defeat by Australian fourth seed Alex de Minaur.
“I am a competitive person and it is difficult to play without being able to give my best. If you ask me if I was happy in Barcelona, I say ‘no, I wasn’t happy’. What happens is that if I had tried to be happy in Barcelona today I probably wouldn’t be here, that’s the reality,” Nadal said.
“That’s why I want to try to go out and play in Paris feeling capable enough to compete well. I’m going to do my best to try to make it happen, and if it doesn’t I’ll have the personal satisfaction and the gratitude for having tried.
“We’ll see what happens, but the world doesn’t end if I don’t play at Roland Garros. I also have the Olympic Games ahead of me.”

FAISALABAD: Multan, Lahore and Karachi registered comfortable victories in the fourth round of the National Women’s One-Day Tournament at different venues in Faisalabad on Wednesday.
The first match of the day saw Noor-ul-Iman claiming a brilliant five-wicket haul to lead Multan to a four-wicket win against Peshawar at the Bohranwali Ground.
Peshawar posted a paltry total of 101 as they were bundled out in the 38.2 overs, courtesy of some clinical bowling by Noor, who gave just 25 runs in 9.2 overs.
Aleena Shah was the only Peshawar batter to offer some resistance as she scored a cautious 50 off 86 balls before being castled by Multan captain Gull Rukh.
Peshawar’s spinner Momina Riasat dealt some early blows as she quickly removed opener Rabia Rafi (0) and Gull (nine) to give her side hopes of victory. But some responsible batting by Rimsha Rajput (20 not out) and Tasmia Rubab (26 not out) took their team over the line in 34.4 overs.
Meanwhile, Lahore’s skipper Kaynat Hafeez played a careful 58-runs knock before Noreen Yaqoob took three wickets to help their team secure a comprehensive 88-run win against Quetta at the Jawad Sports Complex Ground.
Batting first, Lahore posted a respectable total of 199 in the stipulated 50 overs for the loss of nine wickets and wrapped Quetta’s innings on 111 in the 46th over to claim the victory.
In Wednesday’s last match, Peshawar’s suffered a crushing defeat against Karachi, with four of their top-order batters falling victims to runs outs.
Huraina Sajjad (76) and Syed Aroob Shah (44) responsible batting helped Karachi post a total of 190 with Peshawar’s bowler Hamna Iqbal returning with the figures of 4-25 in 9.2 overs.
In reply, Peshawar got off to a decent start but in a bizarre turn of events their four top-order batters, including top-scorer Maham Anees (56), were ran out to hand Karachi a 36-run victory.
Scores in brief:
Multan beat Peshawar by four wickets:
Peshawar 101 all out in 38.2 overs (Aleena Shah 50; Noor-ul-Iman 5-25); Multan 104-6, 34.4 overs (Tasmia Rubab 26 not out, Aleena Masood 24; Momina Riasat 3-7).
Lahore beat Quetta by 88 runs:
Lahore 199-9 in 50 overs (Kaynat Hafeez 58, Noreen Yaqoob 31; Ayesha Amjad 4-44); Quetta 111 all out in 46 overs (Khadija Chishti 21; Noreen Yaqoob 3-22).
Karachi beat Rawalpindi by 36 runs:
Karachi 190 all out in 48.2 overs (Huraina Sajjad 76, Syeda Aroob Shah 44; Humna Bilal 4-25); Rawalpindi 154-9 in 50 overs (Maham Anees 56; Anosha Nasir 2-26).

8,Arsenal hammer Chelsea to go top of Premier League,LONDON: Ruthless Arsenal threw down the gauntlet in the Premier League title race with a 5-0 thrashing of London...,"LONDON: Ruthless Arsenal threw down the gauntlet in the Premier League title race with a 5-0 thrashing of London rivals Chelsea to go top of the table and ramp up the pressure on Liverpool and Manchester City on Tuesday.
Any remaining doubts about Arsenal’s staying power were answered emphatically as Leandro Trossard gave them an early lead before Ben White and Kai Havertz scored two each in a dazzling spell after the break to sweep aside a dazed Chelsea.
It was a powerful statement by Arsenal who have recovered impressively from a home defeat by Aston Villa and bowing out of the Champions League and with four games remaining they are piling the pressure on Liverpool and Manchester City.
Arsenal have 77 points from 34 games with Liverpool, who face Everton, on 74 from 33. Reigning champions Manchester City have 73 points but have two games in hand starting with a trip to Brighton and Hove Albion on Thursday.
It was the sixth time Arsenal have scored five or more in a Premier League game this season without conceding and in such a tight race they now have a huge goal difference advantage which could prove crucial to the outcome.
“Very happy with the win, with the amount of chances and goals we scored,” Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, whose side face arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, said.  “And with the clean sheet as well it shows the consistency.
“We will enjoy it and rest and get ready for the next one.”
For ninth-placed Chelsea it was a humbling night as they suffered their heaviest ever defeat by Arsenal and a hammer blow in their bid to creep into a European place just days after their narrow FA Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester City.
“The team showed a lack of capacity to resist, that is what is the problem,” Mauricio Pochettino, who gave a first Premier League start to young right back Alfie Gilchrist, said. “Arsenal are a very good team. But I think we allowed them to play.”
Arsenal were brimming with energy in the opening half, peppering Chelsea’s goal with 13 attempts and would have led by more than one at the interval if not for Chelsea’s Serbian goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic.
Roared on by a fired-up Emirates Stadium crowd the hosts needed only four minutes to settle any nerves as a marauding Declan Rice drove into the heart of the area and weighted his pass perfectly for Trossard to fire home.
Petrovic would have been disappointed to be beaten from a narrow angle but made amends with a flurry of saves in quick succession to deny Bukayo Saka and Trossard and then reacted incredibly to keep out a close-range deflection.
Despite being under siege, a Chelsea side without 20-goal Cole Palmer had their moments and Axel Disasi somehow failed to connect from in front of goal from a flicked on corner.
Nicolas Jackson hit the post and then inexplicably failed to head in a brilliant Conor Gallagher cross.
But Arsenal turned up the heat in the second half and Chelsea simply evaporated.
White made it 2-0 in the 52nd minute after Rice’s shot deflected to him off Thomas Partey and Havertz was then played through by an exquisite pass from captain Martin Odegaard and finished in style.
Former Chelsea forward Havertz made it 4-0 with a low finish off a post and White admitted he got a little lucky as his side-footed attempted cross turned into a deft finish.
“The second one was a bad touch and it went in,” he joked.
It could have got far worse for Chelsea with Rice hitting the post as Arsenal ran riot but the home fans left in euphoric mood as a first title in 20 years began to look within reach.

Participants took part in four 10-minute sessions of various disciplines dubbed  “Run in the Louvre” in four emblematic rooms of the world’s most visited museum.
The project is one aspect of the Cultural Olympiad programme developed by the Paris 2024 organisers.
In the museum’s Cour (hall) Marly, which features French sculptures that adorned 17th-century King Louis XIV’s chateau in Marly, participants took part in a yoga lesson.
They then got a chance to learn dancehall, a Jamaican dance, amidst statues hailing back to the reign of ancient Assyrian King Sargon II in the Louvre’s Cour Khorsabad.
Next up was disco in the Cour Caryatides, which features the former ballroom of 16th-century King Henry IV.
The workouts amid artworks ended with a cardio exercise at the foot of the walls of the Louvre’s mediaeval castle.
In all, there will be 16 such sessions of up to 30 participants, arranged by French choreographer Mehdi Kerkouche, taking place from 8-9 a.m., before the museum opens to the general public, through May 31.
The Louvre Museum is the world’s largest, drawing around 30,000 visitors daily and nearly 10 million per year.

ROME: A late goal by striker Arkadiusz Milik sent Juventus into the final of Coppa Italia with a 3-2 aggregate win over Lazio despite a 2-1 defeat in the second leg of their semi-final on Tuesday.
Juventus beat Lazio 2-0 at home in the first leg but forward Valentin Castellanos levelled the tie when he scored twice by the 48th minute, before substitute Milik netted the decider from close range seven minutes from time.
Record 14-times winners Juventus, who lifted their last trophy when they won the Italian Cup in 2020-21, have reached their 22nd Coppa Italia final.
“Lazio had to turn the game around, it was normal to expect aggression,” Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri told a press conference.
“After the 2-0 at the start of the second half we improved and we got the result against an excellent Lazio. (But) we should have scored first.
“Today was an important match, our elimination would have led to a dangerous psychological repercussion given that we are not yet mathematically (qualified for) the Champions League.”
Lazio were quick to revive the fans’ hopes for a turnaround from the first leg’s deficit when Castellanos outjumped the Juve defence to give the hosts the lead on the night with a towering header in the 12th minute, nodding home a Luis Alberto corner.
He could have scored the second just before halftime, when he broke into the area after latching on to another neat pass by Alberto, but Juve keeper Mattia Perin kept his low shot out.
However, Castellanos made no mistake after the break when Alberto teed him up just outside the box and the Argentine sent the ball low past Perin and into the net to level the tie.
That shook Juventus up and Dusan Vlahovic had two close chances soon after, before Milik struck from point-blank range to book the spot in the final.
Filip Kostic sent a long cross from the left and across the face of the goal for Timothy Weah, who squared the ball to Milik and the Poland striker finished with a tap-in two minutes after entering the pitch.
Juventus will face the winner of the second semi-final between Fiorentina 
The Turin side will play either Atalanta or Fiorentina in the May 15  final at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico, with the Florence outfit leading 1-0.

KRL needed two runs off the final delivery but manage to get only one as Kashif Ali was ran out before completing the second. As there was no Super Over, points were equally shared between the two sides.

12,Salt Lake City poised for 2034 Olympics award,NEW YORK: Salt Lake City is all but guaranteed to be awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics later this year and officials...,"NEW YORK: Salt Lake City is all but guaranteed to be awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics later this year and officials said its robust infrastructure and enthusiastic public support have paved the way.
Utah’s capital city hosted the Games back in 2002 and International Olympic Committee representatives recently toured the city and heard plans for its  “no-build” Games.
No other cities are in the running for the 2034 Games. Salt Lake City 2034 and France 2030 were picked as preferred hosts for the Winter Olympics in November.
“They got the opportunity to see our venues and how they are still thriving,” Catherine Raney-Norman, chair of the Salt Lake City — Utah Committee for the Games, told Reuters in an interview.
“They left excited with what they had seen. It was extremely positive.”
While other cities have soured on the idea of hosting an Olympics for fears of cost overruns that is not the case in Salt Lake City, where the legacy of the 2002 Games endures.
“Our polling has shown that we have over 80% public support,” said Raney-Norman, a four-time Olympic speed skater. “That’s amazing. And we’ve had that consistently for the past 20 years.”
Ensuring the public remains on board is one of the challenges that comes with having a 10-year leadup to the opening ceremony.
“Our challenge is making sure we maintain that enthusiasm and also making sure we have intentional impact on our community,” she said.
“We don’t have to build buildings so our headline in 2034 is going to be based on our impact in the community more so than standing up a new building.”
The Winter Olympics have grown by about 40% since Salt Lake City hosted them last as more sports and disciplines have been added but the city can handle the additional action, Raney-Norman said.
“We know that within our venues and within our technical side that we can execute on those events,” she said. “We’re embracing it, we’re excited about it.”
New events like big air could be held at a temporary downtown venue while the University of Utah will serve as the athlete village, she said.
Salt Lake City initially wanted to bid for the 2030 Games but dropped plans due to it being too close to the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The IOC is expected to formally name the city as host on July 24.
Hosting an Olympics within 10 years of LA28 is a  “generational opportunity” for the United States and Raney-Norman said dialogue is already happening between the organising committees.
“As we look to a future award and Salt Lake hopefully officially being named the host for 2034, we see opportunities and synergies as we continue to collaborate,” she said.
“This is an opportunity to elevate the Olympic and Paralympic movement in the United States and that requires collaboration between the two groups.”
