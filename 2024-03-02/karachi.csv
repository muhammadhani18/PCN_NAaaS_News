KARACHI: Under the ongoing westerly wave, the city received moderate to heavy spells of rains with thunder on Friday, which continued intermittently for eight hours throughout the day submerging key roads, underpasses and main arteries in the metropolis.
The area of Quaidabad received the heaviest rain, 42.5 millimetres, or 1.67 inches.
Despite hour-long raining, the life largely remained unaffected as no major incident was witnessed or reported in the city.
Traffic on main roads also kept moving, although with hiccups due to overflowing sewage lines which continued to test the patience of motorists and pedestrians.

Key roads, underpasses, main arteries submerged

The Sindh government’s move of declaring Friday as half day a day earlier and issuing a warning to people of ‘not to step out of their homes unnecessarily’ coupled with the hype on social media about expected torrent rains apparently worked as people preferred to stay indoors leaving roads with thin traffic while many commercial centres also remained deserted.

As predicted by the Met office, the rain started pouring in most parts of the city after 11am on Friday which continued with frequent breaks till sunset.
The most intense spell was witnessed in the evening a little before sunset when most parts of the city received heavy downpour.
The Met office said though the fresh system under the westerly wave was still there, it had already lost its intensity and expected to fizzle out in Karachi by Saturday morning and by evening in other parts of Sindh.
After Quaidabad that received the heaviest amount of rains, other prominent spots included DHA Phase-II which received 39.5mm rain, followed by Korangi with 39.3mm, Keamari 31mm, Surjani Town 30.4mm, PAF Base Faisal 26mm, Nazimabad 12.5mm, airport 12.3mm and University Road 10.3mm.
All other areas of the city, according to the Met Office, received a single-digit count of the downpour.
While rainwater accumulated in several areas, timely response from the Sindh government and the city administration with deployment of machinery managed to clear most key roads within in couple of hours.
The city administration pulled all available resources together and executed its emergency plan accordingly, officials said.
“It has rained constantly for the past 2 hours and has just stopped,” Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab Siddiqi wrote in a post on social media platform X [formerly Twitter] after the last spell in the evening.
 






 






“For the information of commuters, Shahrah e Faisal is clear and open for traffic. All municipal staff is out on the roads to ensure that inconvenience to people can be minimised. Suction machinery at all the underpasses is in working condition as well to ensure water is dispersed,” he posted.
Apart from pumps, he said, 53 suction vehicles were moved to various locations for clearing of rainwater as and when required, he said.
Apart from traffic police, wardens had also been placed on major arteries to help ease the traffic flow, he added.

The Jamshed Quarters police said that the ‘encounter’ took place between police and the ‘White Corolla Gang’ near Hussaini Yateem Khana, Teen Hatti.
Area SHO Syed Imtiaz Husain said that a patrolling police party had indicated some suspects to stop but they opened fire on them in their bid to flee.
East SSP Syed Irfan Bahadur said both the suspects suffered critical bullet wounds and died on way to the hospital.
The deceased were identified as Mohammed Shahid alias Burgar and Shahid Qureshi alias Kala.
Their two accomplices managed to escape from the spot in their car.
The police claimed to have recovered two TT pistols from the suspects’ custody.
“The killed suspects had established a reign of terror in the metropolis. They used a white Toyota Corolla for carrying out their criminal activities,” the official added.
The police said that Shahid was involved in over 26 house robberies while Qureshi was previously arrested in more than 10 robberies. However, he was enlarged on bail later.
A few days ago, the gang had committed a robbery at the house of a lawyer in the Al-Falah area. However, police reached the scene and during an encounter managed to arrest their accomplice Imran alias Mani in a wounded condition.
Likewise, another member of the same gang was held after an encounter in Gulistan-i-Jauhar when they were fleeing after looting a house.
In August 2023, the police had killed five suspected robbers in a North Karachi area and claimed that they were part of the White Corolla Gang.

2,Murad irked by secretaries’ absence in surprise visit to Sindh Secretariat,Neither Food Secretary Nasir Abbas Soomro nor Health Secretary Dr Mansoor Rizvi present in their offices.,"KARACHI: Expressing extreme displeasure over the absence of the administrative secretaries and heads of provincial government departments in their respective office, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday directed the chief secretary to ensure their availability during office hours.
Official sources told Dawn that the CM was utterly disappointed and displeased when he found secretaries of departments absent during his visit to New Sindh Secretariat, also housing his office at the seventh floor.
The sources said that the chief minister started his morning with surprise visits to check dewater machinery in the low-lying areas and to check the attendance of officers at the New Secretariat, where he was welcomed by Chief Secretary Dr Fakhre Alam.
 






They said the CM noticed that several secretaries were absent from their offices by 9.30am during his visit and instructed the chief secretary to issue directives to the department’s secretaries to arrive on time at their offices, saying that the lower cadre of staff would be punctual only if the secretaries reached their offices on time.
He also visited the office of General Administration Secretary Muhammad Ali Khoso on the second floor to find him absent. Then the chief minister climbed the stairs to third floor to the office of Works and Services Secretary Nawaz Sohoo, who had also not reached his office by then, said the sources.
Food Secretary Nasir Abbas Soomro was not either available at his office on the fourth floor to add to the displeasure of the chief minister. Nor was Health Secretary Dr Mansoor Rizvi present in his sixth-floor office when the chief minister visited it.
Later in the afternoon, the principal secretary of the chief minister wrote a letter to the chief secretary, expressing the CM’s displeasure over the absence of the secretaries in their respective offices during the office timings.
The letter to the chief secretary said that the observance of punctuality in office was a linchpin of effective governance and the chief minister had noticed the absence of the secretaries in their offices. “Consequently, this negative trend affects lower formations, office discipline and causes inconvenience for the public as well,” it added.
“The directions and displeasure of the chief minister may please be conveyed to all the administrative secretaries for compliance in order to enhance the efficiency of the departments in public interest.
The sources said that the CM had sent a clear message to the top bureaucrats to maintain punctuality, otherwise further action would be taken against them.

They were speaking at the 14th Biennial Pakistan Society of Nephrology (PSN) Conference, currently underway at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT).
To be concluded on March 3, the event has brought together renowned nephrologists from several countries, including the US, UK, Canada and Australia.
Addressing the inaugural session on Friday, SIUT director Adib Rizvi said: “Healthcare is a birthright. Everyone is entitled to it irrespective of caste, colour, creed and religious beliefs. The philosophy behind SIUT is: we don’t let anyone die because he or she cannot afford to live.”
He also emphasised the importance of collaboration within the medical community. “This is very much needed. 
This cooperation would help in effectively addressing the unique healthcare challenges people face in our country,” he said.

4,SHC asks commissioner to ensure de-silting of city drains,"KARACHI: As intermittent showers kept civic authorities on their toes the entire day, the Sindh High Court on Friday...","KARACHI: As intermittent showers kept civic authorities on their toes the entire day, the Sindh High Court on Friday expressed resentment over the city administration for not enforcing the directives of the Supreme Court regarding de-silting of all storm water drains and removal of all encroachments.
A two-judge bench, comprising Justice Salahuddin Panhwar and Justice Mohammad Abdur Rahman, directed the Karachi commissioner to inspect all the storm water drains across the city and ensure their cleaning as well as removal of unauthorised structures from them.
In the past, the judiciary had to step in on various junctures to address the issues of the city’s drains after the Sindh government and city administration had failed to timely take any initiative for de-silting nullahs before the monsoon seasons.
In 2022, the poor sewerage and drain infrastructure had caused flooding during the torrential rains in the city, including the posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton.
Citing the local government secretary, commissioner, district administration concerned and others as respondents, a woman had approached the SHC in 2022, seeking implementation of apex court orders about removal of encroachments around nullahs as well as de-silting of such nullahs.
The petitioner submitted that the city administration was not taking any initiative for cleaning of nullahs and the drains located in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, and that other parts of the city had also been encroached upon.
She asked the SHC to issue directives to the respondents for proper implementation of apex court orders.
The bench expressed resentment over the city administration for not enforcing the directives issued by the apex court in letter and spirit.
Justice Panhwar remarked that besides removal of encroachments, the Supreme Court had also ordered cleaning of drains in the city and asked the authorities concerned whether the de-silting of drains had been carried out.
The petitioner contended that neither the encroachments had been cleared in and around various drains in district East and other parts of metropolitan nor had the cleaning process been initiated yet.
The bench deplored that the officials concerned used to file ambiguous and vague replies on the court directives.
It asked the commissioner to personally visit the drains along with the petitioner and take serious efforts to implement the apex court orders about encroachments and cleaning of such drains.
It also directed the commissioner to come up on March 26 along with compliance report.
It may be recalled that a demolition drive was carried out along three major drains in the city: Gujjar, Mehmoodabad, and Orangi Town nullahs in order to widen them on the orders of the apex court in 2020-21, rendering thousands of families homeless.
In the past, the Supreme Court had also ordered the provincial and city administration on various occasions about cleaning of drains following the inaction of authorities concerned and complaints of the city mayor about lack of funds.
In June 2018, the apex court had expressed serious resentment over a delay in de-silting drains and ordered the municipal authorities to clean sewers and storm-water drains across the city within a month.
In August 2020, the Supreme Court had tasked the National Disaster Management Authority with the cleaning of all storm-water drains of the city after the provincial and city administrations had failed to do so.

5,US reaffirms support for expanding access to education,Ambassador Blome meets students at school in Damba Goth; also calls on Sindh CM,"KARACHI: US Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome has said high quality basic education positions every child for success and Washington firmly believes that it is one of the best investments that it can make in any country.
He said this while speaking at a programme held to celebrate the successful completion of the Sindh Basic Education Programme (SBEP) at a high school in Karachi’s Damba Goth on Friday. 
“Let’s continue to expand access to education, prioritise learning, and scale these reforms across Sindh and all of Pakistan so that all children can thrive,” the envoy added.
The US diplomat visited different classrooms and sections of the schools and met with students there.
Former education minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah and school education secretary Dr Shereen Mustafa also attended the closing ceremony. 

Ambassador Blome meets students at school in Damba Goth; also calls on Sindh CM

SBEP, funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), invested $159.2 million to build 106 schools and strengthen the education sector throughout Sindh, said a press release issued here.
The plan was developed in response to the devastating floods of 2010-11, which destroyed the school infrastructure in Sindh.At present, over 80,000 students from disadvantaged communities have access to top-tier education in modern, climate-resilient schools — equipping an entire generation with the skills and knowledge essential for 21st-century success. 
These new schools not only survived the catastrophic 2022 floods, but also served as safe havens for neighbouring communities and as platforms for parent and community engagement. 
In addition to building schools, the programme strengthened communities and introduced innovative school management models, paving the way for successful public-private partnerships that are now replicated in other provinces.
Congratulates Murad on becoming CM third time
Ambassador Blome also called on Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday and congratulated him on becoming the chief minister for the third time. 
“I came to congratulate you before all diplomats,” he said to the CM, according to a press release issued from the CM House.
Both sides discussed the CM’s priorities for the third term, which include implementation of the 10-point agenda of PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, complete restoration of law and order in the province, providing clean water to the people and working on the Karachi’s infrastructure including its public transport system. Providing social protection, poverty eradication in the province and creating more industrial job opportunities are also on his list.
The CM also said that he was going to take important steps for the development of education, strengthen the economy through industrial and agricultural development while also completing other development work that he had started in Sindh earlier.
The ambassador also said that the US government would provide all possible support for the development of Sindh, which includes more work in the education sector.

6,Urdu adaptation of The Truth premiered at Napa,"KARACHI: French novelist, playwright and film-maker Florian Zeller is a celebrity in his country. In 2020, he shot ...","KARACHI: French novelist, playwright and film-maker Florian Zeller is a celebrity in his country. In 2020, he shot to international fame when he penned and directed the film The Father starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. It earned Hopkins his second best actor Oscar award and Zeller his first in the category of best adapted screenplay — the movie was a screen adaptation of his own play. 
The Truth is one of his known dramas whose Urdu version written and directed by Usama Khan premiered at the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) on Thursday evening.
The Truth is about two married couples. One pair — Maaz and Lareb — is played by Husnain Falak and Kiran Siddiqui and the other — Aira and Arham — by Eshah Shakeel and Jibran Khan. It explores the theme of fidelity. This sounds utterly serious; after all, fidelity is a serious subject and in some people’s opinion, the ultimate test of a human’s strength of character. On surface, the story deals with it in a lighter vein in order to investigate the concealed sides of urban men and women through tit-for-tat lines and bon mots intended to bristle with many a meaning.
When the play begins, Maaz and Aira are seen in a hotel room. They’re having an affair for the last six months. During the conversation, it emerges that Aira is married to his best friend, Arham, who is jobless, a fact that is often discussed by them. It is also evident that infidelity perturbs her whereas he comes across as a jumpy character who doesn’t find it hard to lie through his teeth.
With the help of a revolving stage, the scene is switched to Lareb who tries to probe her husband about where he’s been. By that time, however, it seems that things aren’t fully revealed. In the latter half of the play, chitchat between Arham and Maaz complicates the matter as the line between who is telling the truth and who is fibbing gets blurred.
One was intrigued to see the phrase ‘dark comedy’ highlighted on the poster of The Truth. Watching the play one does find some amusing moments in it but the ‘dark’ aspect appears to be missing. This is largely because the Urdu text lacks the layers one expects in a subject as complicated as human relationships. Then the use of the word bola (talk or say) in several lines makes the dialogue sound colloquial which in turn imparts linearity to the text. Also, Eshah and Jibran need to work on voice projection. Sometimes one couldn’t clearly even get the names of the other characters they’re saying.

It was a day made interesting by the heavy overcast conditions and the rain that began to come down in the afternoon. Though the downpour was pretty heavy, it did not dampen the APMC spirit as it kicked off its three-day proceedings with two enlightening panel discussions. 
The first one, moderated by Taimoor Khan Mumtaz (who moderated the other session as well) was on the khayal gaeki and Hazrat Amir Khusrau. Renowned qawwal Abu Muhammad and Ustad Raza Ali Khan were the speakers. 
Talking about the genesis of the khayal, Abu Muhammad narrated a story from the time when Alauddin Khilji held sway over the region. A man called Nayak Gopal put some questions to Khilji who was needed to respond to them as per the court manners. At the time Khilji was not on good terms with Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia, but since he didn’t have the answers to the question, he went to Hazrat Nizam. Hazrat Nizam asked Hazrat Amir Khusrau to seek answers to the queries. After listening to the questions, Khusrau sought six months’ time from the court to come up with the responses. At that point a chowki (a group of 12 students) of qawwal bachas was created by Khusrau and the boy that led the group was Miyan Samat bin Ibrahim. As a result, the answers to the questions were prepared which included qol, naqsh and tarana etc. Subsequently, individuals such as Bade Mohammad Khan tried to change the khayal. “Our training as qawwal begins with learning classical music,” he added.
Ustad Raza Ali Khan said Hazrat Amir Khusrau was the initiator of the khayal. Later, the genre was modified by other musicians. He was of the view that it was the folk inclusion in classical music that diversified it. Ustad Raza Ali Khan also made the point that in the khyal gaeki words are unimportant.
The second panel discussion was on the topic of the education of music participated by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan, Ustad Ashraf Sharif Khan and Ustad Shahbaz Hussain. Answering a question Ustad Fateh Ali Khan laid emphasis on the ustad-shagird tradition in music. He was of the view that without a guru, nothing can be achieved.
Live music was lined up after the discussions.

8,Country needs registry for people suffering from rare diseases: experts,KARACHI: Diseases that are considered rare in other parts of the world affect a considerable number of people in...,"KARACHI: Diseases that are considered rare in other parts of the world affect a considerable number of people in Pakistan and their numbers are growing. It is important for the country to have a registry on this subject so that the hidden burden of rare ailments is identified and a strategy developed to ensure proper care of patients.
This was stated by Karachi Health Services Director Dr Saqib Ali Shaikh at a presser held on Thursday in connection with ‘Rare Disease Day’ by Roche Pakistan Limited at the press club.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Shaikh said the government recognised that issue and was making efforts to support the patients affected by such ailments. In that respect, he referred to government assistance being provided to hemophilia patients in Sindh. 
“We need a national registry on rare diseases. In Sindh, the newly-launched District Health Infor­mation System could be used to gather data on this subject. The evidence-based data collected both from the public and private sectors would help make realistic policies,” he said.
Dr Raman Kumar, a senior paediatric neurologist, talked about spinal muscular atrophy, a severe neuromuscular disease and one of the leading genetic causes of infant deaths.
He called for healthcare professionals’ capacity building and improved healthcare infrastructure to serve the patients suffering from the rare diseases. 
“All stakeholders, including the government, need to work towards empowering people living with spinal muscular atrophy for equitable access to diagnosis, treatment care and social opportunities.”
Senior haematologist Dr Munira Borhany talked about Hemophilia A, one of the most common bleeding disorders in Pakistan. 
“It’s a debilitating and life-threatening bleeding disorder, severely affecting the quality of patients who may experience spontaneous bleeding and bleeding due to trauma within the muscles, joints, and other internal organs. These bleeding episodes may either be fatal or result in permanent joint disability.”
The patients, she pointed out, experienced long-term psychosocial impacts as well. Children faced barriers to socialisation (missed school, unable to play with friends), leading to impact on education and career decisions. 
“There is a dire need for our provincial governments to provide utmost support, especially in terms of standard-of-care treatment so that patients could live normal lives and become active members of society,” she said.
Other experts highlighted the problems about the patients with rare diseases often suffer in silence as they remain without diagnosis and even those, who are diagnosed, fail to receive the care they need.
The lack of government healthcare spending and support, they said, made the treatment burden for rare diseases even more difficult to bear.

HRCP’s adviser Imdad Chandio said that a strong platform was needed for protecting fundamental human rights. This was the only way to achieve basic human rights, he said.
Suleman G. Abro, an NGO representative, said that all civil society representatives needed to be part of a joint platform for promoting enlightenment and building a just society. This joint action committee being formed would be made a powerful forum, he said.
Women Action Forum (WAF) activist Dr Arfana Mallah said that freedom of expression and human rights had been intentionally snatched in this society. Women’s and oppressed peoples’ voices were stifled and they felt suffocated in society, she said, adding that all organisations and progressive forces must be part of a joint platform.
WAF activist Amar Sindhu pointed out that incidents like Jan Mohammad Mahar and Fatima Furiro murders proved that journalists and women were not safe in this society. She called for a unified struggle by Hyderabad’s civil society across Sindh.
Prof Abdul Majeed Chandio said that extremism had increased in society and tyranny should be collectively resisted.
Hyderabad Union of Journalists (Afzal Butt) president Iqbal Mallah said that struggle for fundamental rights must be powerful.
The meeting condemned Ichhra market incident in Lahore where a woman was harassed for wearing dress with Arabic words printed on it and termed it anti-woman behaviour. 
It also condemned delay in the arrest of culprits in Mahar murder case, which proved that they were more powerful than the government, it said.
It deplored delay in handing down punishment in Fatima case and demanded protection to female polio workers and transgender persons. It said the government was not serious in resolving problems of the differently-abled people.

11,Sehwan hosts half-a-million pilgrims on second day of Qalandar urs,"A mystic and folk music session, Mulakhro contests, and book fair attract big crowds of visitors.","DADU: An estimated half-a-million men, women and children packed the shrine of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and its close vicinities in Sehwan city on Friday to attend the 772nd urs of the revered saint on the second day of the celebration.
Celebrated for three consecutive days every year, the urs always attracts Qalandar’s devotees, who start thronging Sehwan several days before the formal inauguration of the celebration, from across the country and also from some other countries.
Soon after Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori formally inaugurated the urs celebration a day before, many groups of devotees, each holding green chaddar with Quranic verses embroidered on it, walk up to the great saint’s grave to spread over it as a mark of respect and religious ritual. They and other people present in the shrine’s courtyard keep raising slogans symbolically calling the Qalandar for favour in blessing of God.
On the second day of the urs again, thousands of people kept struggling to get into the shrine in a disciplined manner and leave it, after praying close to the grave for a couple of minutes to make space for others to follow suit. Like the first day’s deliberations, Sughar Kachehri (a mystic and folk music session), Mulakhro (contests of Sindh’s traditional wrestling) and book fair attracted big crowds of visitors.
Board, lodging and security arrangements
Arrangements have been made to facilitate parking of several hundred thousand motorbikes, cars, coasters, buses and other vehicles in the designated, marked away from the shrine to ensure free movement of such a large number of devotees and other visitors. Big vehicles were not allowed to move closer to it.
Walkthrough gates were installed at all entry/exit points where security personnel checked incoming people with metal detectors. Every vehicle was also checked by police and bomb disposal squad members.
A large number of people travelled to Sehwan from Punjab by a special train while those coming from different parts of Sindh and other provinces opted for regular train services.
The people who were accommodated in the camps and tents pitched for their brief stay were seen complaining about unavailability of essentially required facilities and proper living arrangements, especially cleanliness, drinking water and uninterrupted electricity supply.
Jamshoro Deputy Commissioner Ali Zulfikar Memon,
SSP Mohammad Tariq Nawaz, Sehwan Assistant Commissioner Mohammad Ali Gopang, Major Mohammad Atta of the Sindh Rangers and Pakistan Navy’s commandos inspected various sites to review the living and security arrangements across Sehwan.
They also visited Aral Wah near Lal Bagh by boat to see that no pilgrim resorted to bathe in the canal as several persons had drowned last year.
They appealed to the pilgrims to avoid bathing in the canal, rather, use the showers fixed for them in an adequate number.

It rained lightly and intermittently in Hyderabad since evening, turning weather remained pleasantly cold and accumulating water in low-lying areas. As usual, power supply went off in many areas during rain leading to slower drainage of water.
Electricity played hide and seek throughout the day but Hesco spokesman insisted that power supply was not affected anywhere in the region. He, however, confirmed that five feeders including HDA, Defence, Cantonment and Phulelli did develop faults which were later rectified. 
Till 8pm, 7mm of rain was recorded in the city and 2mm on airport road. It also rained lightly in Jamshoro, Hala, Matiari and other areas. 
Thundershowers pounded Nawabshah city and its surrounding towns of Sakrand, Daur, Jam Saheb and Bandhi, which made the weather pleasantly cold.
Nawabshah Mayor Qazi Abdul Rasheed declared rain emergency in the city whereas commissioner and deputy commissioner inspected storm water drains and low-lying areas of the city.
It rained in Sanghar city, Khipro, Shahdadpur and their adjacent areas throughout the day, prompting municipal authorities to declare rain emergency and put municipal stall on high alert. It also rained in parts of Naushahro Feroze district but luckily no untoward incident related to rain was reported from any area.
Expected rain hit Mirpurkhas and its outskirts as well as other towns of the district. Weather changed in the morning in the city and light rainfall lashed the city and other towns intermittently, as a result most bazaars centres remained shuttered while business activities were severally affected. 
The rain forced people to remain indoors while traffic was thin on roads, which had become slippery. Growers expressed joy at the rainfall and said they needed water for wheat and other crops. 
Sale of plastic sheets went up in the city as people purchased the plastic to save their huts from getting soaked and leak in the intermittent rainfall. It also rained lightly in Mirwah Gorchani, Digri, Jhuddo, Tando Jan Mohammad, Naukot, Kot Ghulam Mohammad, Sindhri, Hingorno, Phuladiyyoon, Khaan, Patoyoon, Jhilori etc.
