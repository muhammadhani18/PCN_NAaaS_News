0,Ichhra Bazaar incident: FIR filed against woman’s harassers,Case referred to the investigation wing of Lahore police for taking further action as per the law.,"LAHORE: Ignoring the pressure mounted by some religious sections, the Lahore police on Friday lodged the First Information Report (FIR) against dozens of miscreants who harassed a woman wearing a shirt with Arabic-script print a couple of days back in Ichhra Bazaar here.
The suspects turning into a charged mob had accused the woman of “blasphemy” as they confused the Arabic alphabet and words with the Quranic verses, endangering her life, as was evident from some mobile phone footage of the incident, which was also highlighted by international media, bringing disgrace to the country.
However, timely action by the police was also lauded in and outside Pakistan when the video clips showed the heroic role of a woman police officer, Gulberg circle ASP Syeda Sheharbano Naqvi, who confronted the mob and rescued the woman.
An official says the police high-ups were under immense pressure not to register an FIR against the suspects and avoid possible confrontation with some religious sections, notorious for resorting to violent agitation in the past. However, some senior government officers were of the view that letting the miscreants off the hook would not only reflect poorly on the law enforcement agencies, but also embolden the ‘extremists’ to repeat such acts in future.
He says the Punjab government also lent full support to the police in initiating action against the miscreants, showing zero tolerance towards such incidents.

‘Policemen who kept charged mob engaged for an hour also deserve recognition’

Finally, a consensus emerged that blasphemy has been a sensitive issue and such incidents have resulted in brutal lynchings in the past in Punjab, like the atrocities committed in Sialkot and Jaranwala.
After discussing the matter in some important meetings, the police high-ups ordered initiation of criminal proceedings against the miscreants with the prime objective of ensuring the writ of law.
The official source says that the Ichhra police lodged an FIR against dozens of suspects, including those who raised religious slogans to ‘add fuel to the fire’, threatening the life of the woman.
 
 

The police sealed the FIR, he says, adding that the case has been referred to the investigation wing of Lahore police for taking further action as per the law.
The source says that though ASP Naqvi was duly appreciated for showing courage and risking her own life to save the woman, the police high-ups ignored the role of some other officers who played an important part by engaging the charged mob for an hour, making the rescue operation successful.
In this regard he highlighted the role of Ichhra SHO Mohammad Bilal Aarbi and Model Town SP Operations Irtaza Komail, saying they were the first to reach the spot and facilitated the woman’s rescue when the mob was advancing towards her, chanting religious slogans.
Following the emergency call, he says, patrolling officer ASI Sajid had rushed to the scene where the mob had besieged a shop wherein the woman had taken shelter fearing lynching.
Meanwhile, the SHO Bilal also reached there at around 1:30pm and immediately put the police personnel on high alert.
He says the SHO spotted a man carrying a loaded weapon and trying to reach the woman. However, the SHO and his team immediately overpowered the suspect, disarmed him and then unloaded the weapon.
The official says that the police personnel led by the SHO formed a multi-layered shield between the mob and the woman as was shown in some mobile phone footage of the incident.
Bilal then informed the SP concerned of the situation, who also reached the spot along with additional force, the official says.
At a point, the situation turned very alarming when the mob hurled serious life threats at the SHO and his force for not handing the woman over to them, he says.
Meanwhile, ASP Naqvi reached there and daringly rescued the woman from the mob, he says.
He says the Model Town SP had also briefed the high-ups about the role of the police officials, including the SHO, the ASI and others in some formal meetings.
However, the police authorities ignored the role of the lower-ranked officials and personnel as none of them was appreciated officially by the department so far, the source lamented.

For the transfers, Punjab IG Dr Usman Anwar met Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and requested her for permission for the transfer of the officers, citing it a special case.
The CM had placed a ban on all kinds of transfers and postings but she approved the request of the IGP and a notification was issued accordingly.
According to the notification, OCU DIG retired Capt Liaqat Malik was transferred and posted as DIG Establishment II vice Zeeshan Asghar who was transferred and posted as Lahore DIG Investigation vice Imran Kishwar. Mr Kishwar was posted as OCU DIG.
An official, privy to the development, told Dawn the transfer of OCU DIG surprised many as his department had busted the network involved in the alleged murder of Ameer Balaj Tipu. He said a clash between the OCU officials and a leading private hospital was also being linked to his transfer. The official said the IGP was supporting Mr Liaqat Malik for his efforts in resolving high profile cases. However, a senior police officer wanted his replacement and finally he was transferred and assigned a new job in the Central Police Office. He said Kishwar’s transfer also sent shockwaves among the police community who believed that he had supervised the investigations of all cases lodged in connection with the 9 May attacks. His transfer may hamper the investigation process being a key officer in respect of May 9 cases.

Gets bail in corruption case

BAIL: A special court for anti-corruption on Friday allowed post-arrest bail to anchorperson Imran Riaz in a graft case about the contract of Dhrabi Lake in Chakwal.
Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq argued on behalf of the media person terming the case false and fabricated. He said the prosecution failed to furnish any evidence against the petitioner. He asked the court to release Imran Riaz on bail.
Deputy Prosecutor Abdul Samad opposed the petition and urged the court to deny bail to the suspect.
He said the suspect and his father secured a contract of Dhrabi Lake in Chakwal in connivance with government officials at a throwaway price.
Judge Safdar Ali Bhatti granted bail to the anchorperson subject to furnishing surety bonds of Rs100,000.
Mr Riaz, when presented before the court last week, rejected the allegations of the ACE saying he had obtained the contract for over Rs40 million, adding that the previous contract of the lake had been given for Rs10 million only.
He said the contract was secured some eight years ago and the ACE registered the case in 2021. He asked the court to inquire with the prosecution about the investigation made over the last three years.

4,Ganweriwala to be converted into tourism centre,Excavation launched at buried city along dead Hakra river,"BAHAWALPUR: The site of Ganweriwala, the ancient city of the Indus Civilisation in Cholistan desert, would be converted into a tourism centre. The excavation at the site, over 100km from Bahawalpur city, started on Friday. 
The announcement regarding the tourism centre at Ganweriwala was made by Bahawalpur Commissioner Dr Ehtasham Anwar Mahaar in the opening ceremony of the excavation. 
He was flanked by Punjab Archaeology Director General Shozeb Saeed, Dr Rafique Mughal, Professor of Emeritus at the Boston University, and heritage expert Sajida Vandal. 
After launching the excavation, the commissioner said the 7,000 years old Ganweriwala was buried across the area of over eighty hectares and it was the second largest city after Mohenjodaro. He described the day of excavation as historic and hoped that excavation would lead to the discoveries regarding the world’s oldest civilization of Hakra river. 

Excavation launched at buried city along dead Hakra river

He thanked Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman for providing funds for the excavation. Dr Mahaar lauded Dr Mughal whose research led to discovery of Ganweriwala. He said that measures would be taken to include Ganweriwala in the UN’s permanent heritage list as the historical Derawar Fort has already been included in the UN’s temporary heritage list. 
The commissioner announced that museums would be established in the Cholistan desert after preservation and restoration of 19 forts and over 500 historical sites and monuments. 
Veteran archaeologist Dr Rafiq Mughal said Ganweriwala was a small city compared to Mohenjordaro but bigger than Harappa. He said the cities like Harappa and Mohenjodaro were generally settled at the heights and a central dune and Ganweriwala was also settled over a mound. 
Sajida Vandal, the CEO of Thaap, said the sand dunes of Ganweriwala were traced in 1975 by Dr Rafiq Mughal and the city was located 60km south-west of Derawar Fort. She added Ganweriwala was located in the middle of Mohenjodaro and Harappa and its distance from Mohenjodario was 340km while from Harappa it was 260km. She lamented that despite the discovery of the remains in 1975 by Dr Mughal, its excavation could not be taken. She disclosed that the experts had observed the existence of the walls of mud bricks, which were also found at various places in the Sindh valley. She said clay pottery and artefacts like a tongawala, a sculpture, a bronze seal and a Goali of mud had been found at Ganweriwala. 
Shozeb Saeed said that the archaeology department realised the significance of the Ganweriwala excavation project and assured that it would continue work on the project in the coming days. He stressed the need to unearth the hidden treasures of Cholistan’s Hakra civilization and its possible connection with Mohenjodaro as it seemed that the Hakra civilisation was the oldest in the world.

The decision follows the transfer of Jhang Deputy Commissioner Abdullah Khurrum Niazi.
On Friday, the Punjab Services and General Administration Department issued a notification relieving Niazi of his duties to join the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on a two-year deputation. In his place, Deputy Secretary (Staff) to Chief Secretary Muhammad Umair was posted as the Jhang DC.
According to a CM office notification available with Dawn, “Chief Minister Punjab is pleased to impose a complete ban on all kinds of transfers/postings with immediate effect, till further orders.”
It further said: “In case of any posting/transfer, which is required to be made on extreme hardship/compassionate or administrative grounds, prior approval will be sought from the chief minister through a summary containing details of tenure of the officer and vacancy position, etc.”  
A senior government official said the chief minister was not informed about this transfer. And when she learnt about it, she directed the issuance of a notification imposing an immediate ban on all transfers and postings until further notice.
The chief minister convened a meeting to discuss the issue and questioned why she was not informed about the transfer order of the DC.  
Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman reportedly explained her that the proposal for the transfer and posting was made by the interim government on Feb 28, and the order was released later.
Maryam Nawaz, who was elected as CM on Feb 26, expressed her displeasure and decided to impose a complete ban on postings and transfers.  
The senior officer confirmed that transfers and postings at the DC and commissioner level cannot be done without the knowledge of the chief minister.
Earlier, seven government officials, including Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman, were inducted into the Pakistan Cricket Board as caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar continues to take long-term decisions before an elected prime minister (who is also PCB patron-in-chief) takes charge on Sunday (tomorrow).
First, the caretaker PM nominated Mohsin Naqvi for the post of PCB chairman. At that time, Mohsin was also working as caretaker Punjab chief minister. Later, he was elected PCB chief on Feb 6, two days before the general elections in the country.
PRINCIPAL SECY: The Punjab government on Friday posted Sajid Zafar Dall as principal secretary to the chief minister.
Mr Dall (PAS/BS-20) was serving in the Punjab Housing Urban Development and Public Health Engineering department.
The Punjab government also relieved former principal secretary to chief minister Sumair Ahmad Syed (PAS/BS-19) of his duties in the provincial government with immediate effect, to join his new assignment as Joint secretary of the Prime Minister’s Office, Islamabad.
The government transferred deputy secretary (staff) to chief secretary Muhammad Umair and posted him as the Jhang DC.

Justice Shahid Karim passed the order disposing of a petition filed by a lawyer.
Advocate Rana Muhammad Sikandar, the petitioner, submitted that the Aurat march had been taking place in Lahore since 2019 with an apparent motive to expose the problems women face in Pakistan.
However, he alleged that it had been observed in the past that the participants of the March indulged in passing indecent comments and social media platforms spread them without any filtration. He pleaded that such activities had been destroying the fabric of society.
The lawyer pointed out that brawls also occurred in the past between the participants of the Aurat March and the activists of Jamat-i-Islami, who also organised the “Haya March” on the same day.
He asked the court to restrain the district government from allowing Aurat March this year in light of the alleged controversial placards and banners.

The exhibitions will remain open till Saturday (today).  
Wagashi exhibition, titled Wagashi-Art of the 5 Senses, presented the pleasantly colored dainty pieces of confectionery called the art of the five senses as they are works of art designed to appeal all the senses with their appearance, flavour, aroma, feel and the sounds of their names. While reflecting the various aspects of nature and the changing seasons, wagashi sweets are exquisitely shaped and crafted earning them the name of edible art, which are traditionally served as an accompaniment to the Japanese tea ceremony . 
Ito Takeshi, Charge d’ Affaires of the Embassy of Japan in Pakistan, inaugurated the exhibitions. 
Yamazaki Tetsuya, the chef of the Embassy of Japan, skillfully demonstrated the art of preparing a variety of beautiful and delicious wagashi sweets, using traditional ingredients and techniques. With his artistic skills and aesthetic sense, Yamazaki elaborately spoke about the cultural significance of Japanese confectionery that not only used at different celebrations and rituals in Japan but also represented the changing seasons.  
The ikebana exhibition by the students and teachers of Lahore Sogetsu Study Group, exhibited their spring arrangements, titled “Mughal Architecture through the eyes of Sogetsu Ikebana”. The floral designs took their inspiration from the numerous floral frescoes of the monuments of the Walled City like Lahore Fort, Sheesh Mahal, Badshahi Masjid , Wazir Khan Masjid, Shahi Hammam, to name a few. 
Neveen Syed, the director of Sogetsu Study Group, gave a live ikebana demonstration, inspired through her inspirational tour of the various historical monuments in Lahore.  
Explaining to the viewers, Ms Neveen said this kind of an exhibition that linked history with flowers, was the first of its kind in Lahore where floral artists of Ikebana expressed their feelings through the meditative art of Sogetsu Ikebana. 
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Ito appreciated the aesthetically pleasing exhibitions of wagashi and ikebana arrangements, and hoped that through these exhibitions more Pakistanis would enjoy the Japanese culture and that the bond of friendship between Japan and Pakistan would be strengthened.  
He commended the hard work of Japanese chef Yamazaki Tetsuya, who especially came from Islamabad to present before Pakistani audience a rare glimpse into wagashi, the art of five senses. 
Mr Ito appreciated the Lahore Sogetsu Study Group that helped in organising these exhibitions successfully in Lahore and displaying ikebana floral arrangements during the emperor’s birthday celebration in Islamabad last week. He also thanked Aamir Shirazi, the honorary consul general of Japan in Lahore, and Dr Ghazala Irfan, the president of PJCA Lahore, for their continued support.
