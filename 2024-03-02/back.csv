0,Imran named primary accused in May 9 riots,Special prosecutor alleges PTI founder’s incitement role; court confirms politician’s bail in four FIRs,"The special prosecutor has designated PTI founder Imran Khan as the primary accused in seven cases related to the May 9 riots and other incidents.

An anti-terrorism court (ATC) proceeded with the hearing on Friday regarding Imran’s applications for interim bail.
Special Prosecutor Rana Shakeel, presenting arguments during the hearing, identified Imran Khan as the main accused in the PM House burning case.

Shakeel pointed to witness statements that allegedly link the PTI founder to incitement, claiming that the former prime minister had urged party leaders to set military installations ablaze.

Reading out witness statements in court, he highlighted the PTI founder's purported calls for people to take to the streets.
The court sought clarification on whether Imran Khan had used social media platforms to attack individuals opposing institutions, to which the special prosecutor responded affirmatively, citing numerous tweets and messages on Instagram.

It is noteworthy that the court has mandated Imran Khan's presence via video link from jail and has called for arguments from the founder's legal representatives.

The seven registered cases against the PTI founder chairman include charges related to Jinnah House and Askari Tower vandalism.

On August 11, 2023, an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) dismissed Imran's pre-arrest bail due to his absence, resulting from his incarceration following a conviction in the Toshakhana case.

Subsequently, in response to a petition filed by Imran Khan, the Lahore High Court overturned the ATC's decision and reinstated his bail petitions. The high court further instructed the trial court to reevaluate the bail petitions based on their merits.

These bail petitions pertain to various cases, including attacks on Jinnah House, Askari Tower, Shadman police station, the burning of PML-N offices in Model Town, an incident involving a container at Kalma Chowk, the murder of PTI activist Zile Shah, and an attack on police outside Zaman Park.

An anti-terrorism court (AT ) on Friday confirmed the pre-arrest bails of PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan in four FIRs registered against him over his alleged involvement in the Zille Shah murder case, Zaman Park riots and arson cases.

The petitioner’s counsel argued before the court that their client had been implicated in fabricated and politically motivated cases, intended solely to demean and embarrass him, despite his lack of involvement in these allegations.

The counsel argued that there was no substantial evidence on record to establish his client's connection to the charges outlined in the FIRs. Urging the court, he requested bail for his client.

On the other hand, the prosecution vehemently contested the petitioner's counsel's account, asserting that there is ample evidence to substantiate the accused's involvement in these cases.

The law officer requested the court to dismiss the bail petitions.

1,Increase in security fee of meters irks senators,"Senator Bizenjo says NDMA, PDMA will pilfer aid for calamity-hit Balochistan"," 
Senators on Friday demanded an explanation from the authorities concerned regarding a whopping increase in the security fee of electricity meters from Rs1,100 to Rs22,000 and condemned the letter written by the PTI founder to the IMF, likening it to inviting foreign organisations to interfere in the internal affairs of the country.

They also raised the issue of the plight of Balochistan where rains have wreaked havoc with Gwadar, the port city of the province, completely submerged.
|
During a meeting of the Senate, chaired by Deputy Chairman Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Senator Kamil Ali Agha termed the increase in the security fee of electricity meters from Rs1,100 to Rs22,000 “very cruel”.

Agha demanded of the authorities concerned to give an explanation that with whose permission they increased the fee, saying that these were the meters that were purchased by the consumer himself/herself.

Meanwhile, Senator Sadia Abbasi condemned writing a letter to the international lender “to interfere in our internal affairs”.
She said, “The IMF always talks to governments. This is not a research institute, this initiative is related to the integrity of Pakistan.”

Sadia said, “Calling other countries and institutions to interfere in internal affairs is a very wrong move. This is a new tradition being introduced … the work of the country should be done within the country.”

Senator Sadia also raised the issue of shortage of passports, saying that for the first time, there was a shortage of passports in the country.

“It is like deliberately insulting the people,” she said, adding that the people were asked to apply on Fast Track.

She demanded calling the director general passport and seeking an answer from him.

Addressing the meeting, Senator Kamran Murtaza said that the situation in Balochistan was worse due to the rains while the higher-ups were involved in manipulation.

“The provincial nor the federal government were paying attention to Balochistan,” he said, demanding that the people's problems should be solved.

“Attention should be paid to Balochistan.”

Senator Tahir Bizenjo said that heavy rains had occurred in Balochistan due to which Gwadar was completely submerged.
Like the Election Commission, Bizenjo said, the situation of PDMA and NDMA was also bad, accusing them of stealing the money that would come for the relief of the people.

He demanded that the aid that comes should go to the deserving people.

PTI Senator Aoun Abbas Bipi said that as the farewell session of the Senate was going on, production orders of Senator Ejaz Chaudhry should have been issued.

“Many PTI women are in jails, no one talks about them,” he said. “Our Senator Shibli Faraz has not come to this house for several months. No one asked why they are not coming or where they are.”

Senator Bahramand Tangi asked about NADRA and WAPDA that domestic institutions had more employees and less revenue.

“Institutions are running in losses. How long will we continue like this?”

Caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi said the ministry did not give any response.

The deputy chairman said, “Solangi Sahib, you have not given any answer today, but still thank you for your visit.”

Senator Dinesh Kumar raised the issue of shortage of medicine at the National Institute for Rehabilitation of Handicapped.

“The institution does not have medicine for the poor. What a joke! Whenever it comes to the poor, it becomes a joke,” Kumar said, adding that there was a shortage of medicines at hospitals in Islamabad.

He asked what the bureaucracy and the Ministry of Health were doing.

Senator Murtaza said that the prices of life-saving medicines had been increased.

“It is now being said that the incoming minister will give an answer, he will say, ask the caretakers.”

The proceedings of the meeting were adjourned till 3pm on Monday.

3,Independents demand share in Punjab cabinet,PML-N flooded with recommendations for key portfolios,"The political scene in Punjab is abuzz with anticipations as the formation of the provincial cabinet hangs in the balance with independents clamouring for their piece of the pie.

According to sources, a ""flood of recommendations"" within the PML-N has encountered the formation of the provincial cabinet, intensifying the race for coveted ministerial positions.

A large number of independent candidates, who jumped ships to the PML-N, have vociferously insisted on securing key portfolios.

In the aftermath of the February 8 general elections that saw most PTI-backed candidates winning, 23 independent members of the Punjab Assembly officially joined the ranks of the PML-N.

The staggering demands from these independent candidates have, reportedly, thrown a wrench in the timely establishment of the cabinet.

In response to the burgeoning demands, sources suggest that a high-stakes consultative meeting of the PML-N is on the horizon, strategically timed after Shehbaz Sharif's presumed election as the premier.

Following the meeting, insiders speculate the emergence of a 16-member cabinet in the initial phase. The consultative session is expected to see additional names being scrutinised for potential inclusion in the cabinet list.

The cabinet formation is likely to take place in two phases. Initially, independent members and individuals affiliated with the PML-Q will take their place in the cabinet.

The subsequent phase will witness the inclusion of members from the IPP and other allied parties.

Meanwhile, amid the political intrigue, the PML-N has reportedly locked in the names of some key figures for the cabinet.
Notable personalities such as Khawaja Imran Nazir, Zakia Shahnawaz, Colonel retired Ayub Gadhi, Bilal Yasin, Uzma Bukhari, and Marriyum Aurangzeb are likely to be included in the provincial cabinet.

7,PTI decries speaker polls sans reserved seats,Announces peaceful protest across the country today against 'large-scale polls robbery',"In a vehement rebuke, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Friday denounced the election of the speaker, deputy speaker, and prime minister in what it labelled as a fraudulent and incomplete National Assembly, devoid of reserved seats for women and minorities.

The former ruling party deemed the election as a violation of constitutional principles.

The PTI spokesperson expressed strong disapproval over the election of the NA speaker and deputy speaker without the prior allocation of reserved seats, asserting that individuals elected with the support of alleged mandate thieves held no constitutional legitimacy.

Citing Article 51 of the Constitution, the spokesperson emphasised that the National Assembly cannot be deemed complete without the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities, proportionate to each political party's representation.
The spokesperson highlighted that 23 PTI-backed members were being denied their constitutional rights under a dubious scheme. Despite this, the spokesperson affirmed the nation's resilience against such malicious plots.

He accused a group of mandate thieves of unlawfully occupying the National Assembly, asserting that their artificial victory would turn into defeat if PTI-backed candidates' reserved seats were allocated according to the constitution.

The spokesperson argued that those who took a fake oath after allegedly stealing the public mandate were aware that their presence in the house was not a result of public votes but rather facilitated by a corrupt and biased Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

Stressing that the majority granted by the people to PTI founder chairman Imran Khan had been converted into a minority through alleged daylight polls robbery, the spokesperson insisted that the election of speaker, deputy speaker, and prime minister would only be deemed constitutional and legal when all truly elected representatives were present in the lower house.

The PTI spokesperson called for an end to the continued disregard of the people's clear verdict and urged the allocation of reserved seats to the party as per the constitutional framework.

He announced that the people would stage a peaceful protest across the country on Saturday (today)  to voice their opposition against the alleged large-scale polls robbery, following the directives of the incarcerated leader, Imran Khan, in a bid to reclaim what he termed the stolen public mandate.

8,Staff shortage hampers PM&DC working,Contract employees have no hope of getting permanent jobs," 
The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) is plagued by a lack of staff as the number of vacancies in the organisation tops 100, despite its restoration more than a year ago and those present there blame incumbent President Dr Rizwan Taj for not doing anything in this regard.

Many in the organisation were sceptical about the hiring of staff on merit by the PM&DC president.

In a council meeting on Feb 23, they said, the participants stressed the need for regularisation of the services of all contractual or daily-wage employees against the available vacancies.

Talking to The Express Tribune, some contract employees complained about their exploitation by the organisation.

They said that they were given the contract for 89 days only.

They also pointed out a vague term in their contract that they would “work till the pleasure of the president”.

These conditions rendered them to mere daily-wage earners, the employees said.

They added that there was no indication whatsoever that the PM&DC would adjust them in its staff.

The uncertainties among workers increases as the organisation’s registrar had been changed three times in less than a year.

When contacted, PM&DC President Taj refused to talk directly to The Express Tribune, but his reply came through a media consultant for the organisation.

“Staff will be hired on vacant seats when needed,” the reply stated. “But, we don’t need staff on those vacant seats. We have advertised seats as per our requirements and the PM&DC hires daily-wage employees only when there is a workload.”

9,Balochistan CM pick raises controversy,Experts call it travesty of law; ECP says anyone resigning before polls can contest election,"A former interior minister of the incumbent caretaker government, becoming a Balochistan chief minister, despite the constitutional bar on him on contesting elections, does away with any doubt that Pakistan is effectively a banana republic, Justice (retd) Wajihuddin Ahmed said.
Other experts even from the PML-N concurred with the view that there was an unambiguous bar in the Constitution of Pakistan on members of the caretaker government from contesting general elections, terming Sarfraz Bugti’s instance as another unfortunate example of mockery of law by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
An ECP official on the other hand refuted any illegality in this regard stating that his organisation was of the sound view that there was no ban on those members of the caretaker cabinet, neither the PM nor the CM, who had resigned even a minute before the elections.
The newly elected 25th Balochistan CM, Bugti, served as an interior minister from Aug 2023 to Dec 2023 and resigned some seven weeks before the general elections after remaining in the second most powerful office after the PM for over four months.
Even then there were murmurs that Bugti, given his role in tackling Imran Khan’s party, had won the blessings of the powerful quarters, and had been promised a powerful position in Balochistan.
Then some section of the media reported that as the election schedule had not been announced, his resignation would qualify him to contest the elections.
Article 224 subsection 1(B) places an unequivocal ban on members of the caretaker cabinet, PM and CM included and their immediate family members, from contesting the following elections.
This article does not draw any distinction between serving members of the cabinet or otherwise.
Justice (retd) Ahmed said it was unfortunate on the part of the ECP that they allowed Bugti to contest the elections despite him having served as an interior minister.
He said Bugti was part of the caretaker government, and when he resigned was irrelevant. “Even if his stay there was a brief stint, he became a part of the caretaker government and by that definition, he is ineligible to even contest elections let alone becoming a CM.”
He also objected to former Punjab CM Mohsin Naqvi being given a coveted slot on the Pakistan Cricket Board. He said that this was the second time a caretaker Punjab CM was bestowed with this lucrative position.
He, however, clarified that nowhere in the Constitution was there any bar on being given such a position but this was against the spirit of the Constitution.
Incidentally, both the caretaker CMs played a very controversial role during the respective elections.
Former ECP secretary Kanwar Dilshad concurred with the view of the Justice (retd) Ahmed, stating that this was a blatant violation of Article 224 of the Constitution.
He said the ECP had taken a different view on it and the matter would end up in the superior court.
He in fact said that some well-reputed NGO should take up this matter before the SC to right this wrong. He said that if this practice was not nipped in the bud now, it would be the beginning of unfortunate events.
He said that if one was to subscribe to the ECP’s view, then that would mean that even the caretaker PM could contest elections, if he resigned a minute before filing his nomination papers.
Former Punjab CM and senior political analyst Hasan Askari said that in his opinion, “this is illegal and against the will of the Constitution”.
He said the ECP and Bugti in their view might exploit an ambiguity in the law but he said that in his opinion, Bugti, once chose to become part of the caretaker government, lost the right to contest these elections. The ECP having allowed this was no surprise, as here many major illegalities were committed by the caretaker governments and no one took cognisance of it just because of the backing of the establishment.
He also objected to the caretaker Punjab CM being giving a position on the PCB, saying that it was against the spirit of the Constitution and akin to luring him into functioning favourably for one party.
An official of the ECP, however, questioned the view point of the experts, asking that as the Constitution explicitly states that only the caretaker members could not contest elections, how that could be applied to someone who resigned.
He said the ECP was of the view that even if the caretaker PM resigned before the elections, he too was entitled to contest the elections.
He said that if this was such a glaring irregularity, Bugti’s opponent should have taken this up before the ECP and then the court.
Interestingly, a senior PML-N lawyer was approached for his views but on the condition of anonymity he too termed the ECP’s decision to allow Bugti to contest elections a sheer mockery of law, stating that the ECP by taking one bad decision after another lost all its credibility.
