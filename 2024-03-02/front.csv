0,PTI hits streets on eve of PM election,Urges authorities to return seats “stolen” from party through “massive rigging”,"Ahead of the vote for the country’s next prime minister, the PTI staged nationwide protests on Saturday against alleged rigging in the February 8 general elections. During the demonstrations, clashes with police resulted in the rounding up of some activists of the former ruling party.
In Punjab’s provincial capital, hundreds of PTI supporters, including members of the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF), gathered at GPO Chowk near the Lahore High Court (LHC) building, staging a vocal demonstration.
However, law enforcement personnel resorted to wielding batons to disperse agitated PTI adherents, detaining several leaders and activists, including Mian Shehzad Farooq, Hafiz Zeeshan, and Supreme Court Bar Association former secretary Aftab Bajwa.
Amid fervent chants, PTI loyalists praised former prime minister Imran Khan while casting doubt on the integrity of the elections and alleging manipulation. The demonstrators demanded justice and the release of both the PTI founder and fellow party members.
According to reports, a police contingent was deployed near the court before the protest started, and arrests were made once protestors gathered there. Police action resulted in dispersing the remaining protestors.
Elsewhere in the city, PTI loyalists poured onto the streets to voice their discontent with the purported electoral irregularities. A protest procession led by PTI provincial lawmaker Ali Imtiaz Waraich meandered from Cavalry Ground, while similar demonstrations took place in Shahdara and outside the Lahore Commissioner's Office.
Hundreds of PTI supporters also gathered at Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh before marching to Islamabad.
Upon reaching the federal capital, PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat addressed party activists, stating that the PTI would continue protesting until Imran Khan is released from jail and the seats stolen through rigging are restored to the party.

He urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the violation of Pakistanis’ fundamental rights under the judiciary’s watch.
“Imran Khan, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Parvez Elahi, Bushra Bibi, Yasmin Rashid, Sanam Javed, and other PTI leaders have been unjustly jailed by the fascist regime imposed on us for the past two years,” he said.
Marwat stated that Imran’s only fault was that he said “absolutely not” to the United States and strived for the “haqeeqi azaadi”—true freedom—of the people of Pakistan.
“We will continue our struggle and protest in the courts, parliament, and on the streets until Imran is released and our mandate is recovered,” the PTI leader said.
The PTI also held a protest demonstration outside the Karachi Press Club against alleged electoral fraud. PTI leaders, including Firdous Shamim Naqvi, Attaullah Khan, Aftab Jahangir, Alamgir Khan, Jamal Siddiqui, Fozia Zeeshan, and Saifur Rahman, addressed the protesters.
They called upon authorities to take notice of the alleged rigging and ensure that the mandate is respected.
They claimed that the elections were stolen from the party across the country, including Karachi. They alleged that defeated candidates were installed using Form 47. Despite this, they said, prominent politicians faced defeat at the hands of PTI workers.
""We will continue our protest to obtain our mandate. We will fight the legal and political battle. We will send our successful candidates to the assembly with our mandate.
“We demand the Chief Justice of Pakistan to ensure the respect of the vote. Investigate the rigging and return our stolen mandate. We will not compromise on our demands at any cost,"" Naqvi said.
A spokesperson for PTI also vehemently criticized law enforcement and governmental apparatuses for impeding the constitutional prerogative of conducting peaceful protests.
""In response to the clarion call of our leader, Imran Khan, the citizens of Pakistan have taken to the streets en masse to reclaim their allegedly pilfered mandate.
“The administration, having secured power through a spurious mandate, exhibits trepidation by resorting to unconstitutional measures to stifle peaceful dissent,"" said a statement issued by PTI’s central media department.
The spokesperson contended that the populace would not countenance the imposition of deceitful actors on the nation based on fraudulent electoral forms.
""The trajectory of Pakistan's future is intertwined with democracy, thus the citizenry should be accorded their constitutional entitlement to shape the course of governance.
""The PTI remains resolute in its nonviolent crusade within the contours of constitutional and legal frameworks to reclaim the purportedly usurped mandate,"" the spokesperson said.

1,"Capital’s DC, SSP, SHO found guilty of contempt",Accused issued detention orders of PTI workers in violation of IHC orders,"The Islamabad High Court has declared the capital's Deputy Commissioner (DC), Irfan Nawaz Memon, Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Jameel Zafar, and Station House Officer (SHO) Naseer Manzoor guilty in a contempt matter regarding the issuance of detention orders of the PTI workers in violation of the court orders.
""In view of the principle of proportionality and the settled principle of fairness that higher the authority the greater his responsibility, this court holds that (i) Respondent No 1, DC Irfan Nawaz Memon, is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with six months simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine, (ii) Respondent No 2, SSP Malik Jameel Zafar, is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with four months simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine, and (iii) Respondent No 4, SHO Nasir Manzoor, is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with two months of simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine.
Respondent Nos 1, 2 and 4 will serve their sentence at Adiala Jail,"" a written order authored by Justice Babar Sattar says.
The judgement notes that the respondents have a right to appeal this verdict before a division bench of this court within 30 days pursuant to Section 19 of the Ordinance.
""As the sentence awarded constitutes a short sentence and the convicted respondents being public servants do not pose a flight risk, the sentence awarded shall stay suspended for a period of 30 days to enable the respondents to avail their remedy of appeal.
In suspending this sentence this court has also taken account the fact that Respondent Nos 1, 2 and 4 occupy public offices and their sudden removal therefrom could adversely affect public convenience.
“The suspension of this sentence would enable the government to respond to this verdict without causing inconvenience to the citizens. If the right of appeal is not availed or if the sentence is not suspended in appeal, Respondents No 1, 2 and 4 will be taken into custody upon expiry of the 30-day period.""
The court also directed prime minister of Pakistan to investigate whether DCs across Pakistan who continued to issue detention orders under MPO in breach of the law and Constitution and judicial orders were acting in an organised manner on the basis of illegal orders, and if so, take appropriate remedial action to ensure that the authority of the state to be exercised through chosen representatives of people, continues to be exercised according to the Constitution and the law.""
The judgment said representative democracy was a salient feature of “our Constitution”, adding that executive authority was vested in the elected representatives of the people. Article 2A of the Constitution provides that “the state shall exercise its authority through the chosen representative of the people”.
""A civil bureaucracy, that Respondents No 1, 2 and 4 belong to, can only exercise such authority as vested in it by law. The Constitution and the law envisage that public officials, as representatives of the executive arm of the state, will exercise state authority as a trust to uphold and enforce the law in the interest of citizens of Pakistan.""
It said that it cannot be countenanced that public officials would wield the law as a weapon to oppress their fellow citizens and deny them their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
""It can also not be conceived that public officials serving as part of the executive branch of the state would wield their powers to undermine and frustrate decisions rendered by the judicial branch of the state.
“Based on the material before this Court, as discussed above at length, this Court is of the prima facie view that the synchronized issuance of detention orders by Deputy Commissioner Islamabad and those in other parts of the country was part of a deliberate policy measure executed by public officials in control of the executive branch of the state from May 2023 onward, with the object of establishing for the consumption of all and sundry that only state organ capable of allowing citizens access to their fundamental rights was the executive itself.
“Such policy and actions taken in its pursuit threaten the concept of separation of powers, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. They also threaten the existence of the Judiciary as an independent pillar of the state conferred with the responsibility of adjudicating grievances between the citizens and the state. If such policy of deliberate and calculated disregard for fundamental rights of citizens and rendering dysfunctional the machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights in the form of an independent Judiciary is allowed to persevere, there can be no rule of law in Pakistan. Further, the very existence and utility of the Constitution would come into question. This Court therefore feels that there is need to investigate whether there was an organized policy to use detention orders issued under the MPO to scuttle the fundamental rights of citizens and undermine the Judiciary.
""Such investigation, to be meaningful, must be undertaken and overseen by the head of the executive branch of the state.""
The judgement noted that between May 9, 2023 and Nov 2, 2023, DC Memon issued some 69 detention orders in exercise of power under Section 3 of the MPO.
The cumulative period of detention that he ordered those who were on the receiving end exceeded 1,000 days. Over two dozen petitions were filed before Islamabad High Court challenging these orders.
These cases were marked before seven out of the eight judges comprising the IHC.
Except for two cases, where detention orders were issued out of concern for sectarian violence, not one order detaining political workers on grounds of incitement of violence sustained judicial scrutiny.
""The court said that respondents were also advised that rendering an unconditional apology would amount to admission that the conduct in question that caused the initiation of show cause proceedings was indeed contemptuous. However, in the event that they sought to justify their conduct and defend themselves they would be afforded complete opportunity to do so in accordance with their rights guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. None of the respondents filed any apology. They chose to justify and defend their actions by producing affidavits and relying on the record summarized above to justify their actions of soliciting and/or issuing detention orders under MPO.""
The court also said that in Pakistan, like other constitutional states, public authority flows from the Constitution and Constitution alone.
""There is no other source of authority. The feature distinguishing legal authority from brute force is legitimacy. In a polity functioning under the Constitution, the concept of de facto power is akin to the concept of brute force.
""It is devoid of legitimacy. The only power that is clothed with legality and legitimacy is that which flows from the law and the Constitution and is thus de jure. The existence and exercise of de facto power in a state administered under a Constitution is the manifestation of weak constitutionalism and speaks to the need to reduce the gap between the law and its implementation.
""The courts of law established under the Constitution and exercising authority vested by law, can never recognize or legitimize de facto power (referred to as ground realities in the vernacular). Doing so would delegitimize the courts themselves.""
The judgement said that a DC or police officer has no authority other than that vested by law and no jurisdiction to exercise it except as mandated by law.
""The actions of public officials are protected by law in so far as they are backed by it. Their source of authority over fellow citizens is the authority of law, not personal authority that be exercised at whim or on the basis of an illegal command.
“Public officials are responsible and accountable for their actions just as private citizens, if not more. The doctrine of agency underlying personal liability is fully applicable to the actions of public office holders""
The judgement also notes that the counsel for DC emphasised repeatedly that the District Intelligence Committee comprised heavyweights, such as respondents No 1 and 2, representatives of IB, ISI, MI, Rangers, Special Branch and the 111-Brigade.
""The only noteworthy aspect of the composition of the District Intelligence Committee (DIC), unfortunately, is the poverty of the opinion rendered by it based on conjectural reports issued by the Special Branch and IB, which any reasonable mind with no security and intelligence training would be able to identify as utterly lacking of substance.
“What is also interesting is that while the DIC, Rawalpindi, with composition similar to that of DIC Islamabad, advised DC Rawalpindi that Shehryar Afridi was no longer a threat to public order and safety, the very next day DIC Islamabad came to the opposite conclusion ie that Shehryar Afridi had become a threat to public order and safety in Islamabad, some 30km away from Rawalpindi where he was no longer a threat to public order.
“The DIC Islamabad was constituted by Chief Commissioner Islamabad by notification dated 10.05.2018. Such committee is neither created under a statute nor is vested with any authority by law.
""The DIC is merely a means to coordinate action between different agencies that have their own legal mandate in Islamabad. Clause (xx) of the DIC’s Terms of Reference (TOR) provides that ‘the committee members shall perform functions and duties within their respective organizational mandate’.
“The DIC’s opinion therefore doesn’t feature even as a fig leaf to justify the illegal and contumacious conduct of respondents No 1, 2 and 4 in soliciting and issuing detention order dated 08-08-2023.""
The judgement said that even otherwise, Article 243 of the Constitution clearly provides that the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.
""Our system of governance, established under the Constitution, is that of representative democracy. The Armed Forces are a subset of the Executive, as a subordinate of the elected civilian government, which act in aid of civil power under Article 245 of the Constitution when asked to do so by the Federal Government. The emphasis of the learned counsel for Respondent No 1 on the inclusion of military officers within the DIC that supported the issuance of detention order dated 08.08.2023, as if that is some magic wand that will miraculously get the respondents off the hook, is misconceived to put it politely. Neither the DIC nor any members of the DIC, whether serving in the Armed Forces or in intelligence agencies, had any authority over respondents No 1, 2 and 4. Neither the reports issued by the Special Branch or by Intelligence Bureau nor the opinion of DIC was binding on respondent No 1.
“In their capacity as the Deputy Commissioner and Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations), Respondents No 1 and 2, respectively, were neither assets nor stooges of security agencies.
""They cannot hide behind members of intelligence or security agencies when found liable for dereliction of the duty, illegal conduct and obstruction of justice.""
The judgment said that it was not the intelligence operatives or even ministers, who had authority to generate requests for issuance of detention orders that respondents No 2 and 4 did, adding that and securities agencies had no power to issue the detention orders that respondent No 1 issued.
""If the demand for issuance of detention orders was illegal, as was repeatedly held by this Court in almost two dozen judgments setting aside detention orders passed by DC Irfan Memon, he was required by law to refuse issuing such orders even if asked to do so by a higher authority.""

2,"Rain, snow pummel up and down country",Rescuers launch relief operation in worst-affected Gwadar,"Rain with snowfall over the hilly areas, pummelled up and down the country on Friday, from the foots of Himalaya and Karakorum to the coast of the Arabian Sea, unleashing floods in some coastal towns in Balochistan and disrupting daily life in the plains of Sindh and Punjab.
Authorities, who had been warned of rains from March 1 to 3 in advance by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), remained on alert in different parts of the country, and launched immediate rescue in Gwadar to save the marooned people.
The rain started on Thursday night and continued intermittently throughout Friday. The rainfall disrupted the daily life in various parts of the country, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, and caused great inconvenience to the travellers. The rain also compelled the people to remain indoors to stay warm.
At least three children were killed and another sustained injuries as the roof of a house collapsed due to rains in Kharan district of Balochistan. In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, an eight-month-old girl was among five people killed in rain related incidents.
So far, Gwadar has been the worst-affected, where incessant rain in several areas caused havoc, damaging houses. The Balochistan government and other rescue organisations, including Edhi Foundation, along with security personnel, started relief activities.
Teams of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), in coordination with the National Highway Authority (NHA), were also operationalised on highways to keep the roads open. The army, navy and the Frontier Corps were engaged in a relief operation in Gwadar, Jiwani, and Subandar areas.
Light to heavy rains also pummelled different parts of Karachi, which disrupted the flight schedule. There was high alert in the province because of the rain. Hyderabad city also received light to moderate rainfall with the downpour sporadically continuing throughout the day.
Upcountry areas
In the federal capital, the rain of moderate to heavy intensity started at midnight and continued till Friday evening. Mercury also dropped in Punjab amid intermittent drizzle. Weather was cold in Lahore and Multan. The rain also cleared smog conditions in Lahore.
Further north, the famous skiing resort of Malam Jabba was snow blanketed after receiving heavy snowfall that attracted tourists and adventure sports lovers in droves. Besides Kalam, Madian and Bahrain, the upper Swat also received moderate to heavy snowfall.
Various roads were closed due to severe snowfall in the vicinity of Lowari Tunnel, Kalam and Malam Jabba. The work of rescuing the passengers has been started. The work of removing snow from the roads was started by the army last night.
In Punjab, the PDMA has forecast heavy snowfall and rain in Muree and Galiyat over the next few days. PDMA Punjab Director General Imran Qureshi urged the local administration to ensure safety measures to mitigate any potential risks.
He appealed to tourists to cooperate with the administration during this time. Tourists should carefully plan their journeys, taking into account the anticipated heavy snow in Murree and severe weather conditions, said Qureshi.
According to the PMD, light to heavy rainfall and snowfall with windstorm, thunderstorms and isolated hailstorm were expected in most parts of the country on Saturday (today).

3,Zardari to face off against Achakzai,Elections for president will be held on March 9,"The political stage is all set for a head-to-head showdown between former president Asif Ali Zardari and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai as both leaders pulled out all the stops to secure allies and numerical support on Saturday ahead of the contest.
The nomination papers for both candidates were filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Farooq H Naik and Saleem Mandviwala filed Zardari's papers while PTI leaders Sardar Latif Khosa and Omar Ayub Khan filed the papers for Achakzai before IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq - the presiding officer for the presidential polls.
Achakzai, backed by the recently forged alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), flexed his political muscles, seeking the support of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman in a meeting at the latter's residence.
Meanwhile, in a notable development, the Awami National Party (ANP) threw its weight behind Zardari, the joint candidate representing the PPP and the PML-N for the presidency.
ANP's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa President Aimal Wali Khan led a delegation to Islamabad to meet with PPPP President Zardari.
During their meeting, the delegation and Zardari engaged in detailed discussions concerning the nation's current political landscape and expressed concerns about the recent election irregularities and the impending presidential elections.
Aimal expressed the ANP's endorsement, citing a commitment to provincial autonomy and recognising Zardari's role in shaping the 18th constitutional amendment, particularly beneficial to K-P.
Aimal, acknowledging Zardari's historical support and “favours”, declared: ""The ANP will not vote for the coalition government but for Asif Ali Zardari's personality in the upcoming presidential elections.""
On the opposing front, Achakzai, vying for the presidency under the SIC banner, approached the JUI-F chief to solicit his vote.
The meeting took place at Fazl's residence, where Achakzai invoked their shared history in the political movement, expressing hope for his support.
Read: People voiced their will: President
However, sources revealed that Fazl, representing the JUI-F, conveyed the party's decision to abstain from direct involvement in the election process.
He said he would consult the party leadership before making any decisions.
According to the ECP schedule, polling for the presidential election will be held on March 9 from 10am to 4pm, while candidates vying for the constitutional post of the country can submit their nomination papers until Saturday noon in Islamabad and four provincial capitals – Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta.
Nomination papers will undergo scrutiny by the returning officer in Islamabad by 10am on Monday (March 4).
The candidates have the option to withdraw their nomination papers before the returning officer in Islamabad until Tuesday noon (March 5).
On the same day, the list of candidates will be made public.
Incumbent President Dr Arif Alvi is already on an extended tenure after completing his five-year term on Sept 9 last year.
Article 44(1) of the Constitution says that the president will hold office for a term of five years from the day he assumes charge, but he continues to hold the office until a successor is chosen.
Alvi is the country’s fourth democratically elected president to complete the five-year term.
The three presidents before Dr Alvi who completed their full terms were Chaudhary Fazal Elahi (fifth president, from 1973 to 1978),
Asif Ali Zardari (11th, from 2008 to 2013), and Mamnoon Hussain (12th, from 2013 to 2018). Therefore, Dr Alvi is the third consecutive president to have a full term and the first one to have an extended term due to an incomplete electoral college, which comprises the National Assembly, Senate and the four provincial assemblies.

4,MQM-P formally joins PML-N led coalition,Both sides sign agreement following talks at Parliament House,"The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Friday formally joined the political alliance between the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to form a coalition government at the Centre.
Both the parties signed a memorandum for the alliance following their talks at the Parliament House.
After the agreement, the MQM-P announced that it would sit on the treasury benches and fully support the PML-N in the election of the speaker, deputy speaker, and prime minister.
According to insiders, it was agreed in the talks that the local government system, resolution of the problems facing the people of Karachi, and devolution of administrative and financial powers would be part of the agreement.
It was further agreed that a constitutional amendment would be made to ensure the devolution of financial resources from the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award to districts and towns, and legislation would be enacted to ensure local government elections were held after every four years.
“The MQM-Pakistan and the Muslim League-N have signed a memorandum. Both parties have reiterated their commitment to transfer power to the people and empower the masses,” PML-N General Secretary Ahsan Iqbal told the media after the signing of the agreement.
“This is the first agreement of its kind in the political history of the country. It’s a panacea for all ailments,” Mustafa Kamal of the MQM-P said.
“It is a test for all political parties. It is better to transfer resources to the lower level,” senior MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar added.
Talking to the journalists outside the Parliament House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari expressed hope that after the agreement, the MQM-P would be accommodated on the positions, where no agreement could be reached between the PML-N and his party.

5,Bugti extends olive branch to disgruntled Baloch,PPP leader elected CM unopposed; official announcement to be made today,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate Sarfraz Ahmed Bugti on Friday emerged triumphant in the race for the Balochistan chief minister, securing an uncontested victory as no other contender submitted nomination papers for the coveted position.
The official announcement of Bugti's nomination as CM is scheduled for 11am today during the provincial assembly session. The swearing-in ceremony for the newly elected chief executive of Balochistan will be held on Saturday evening at the Governor House in Quetta.
Bugti, the former caretaker interior minister and ex-provincial information minister, presented four nomination papers for the chief ministership in Balochistan to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) office.
After submitting his nomination papers for the Balochistan CM’s position, Bugti held out an olive branch to disgruntled Baloch leaders, emphasising decisive action against those who were taking the law into their own hands.
""My party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), believes in dialogue and reconciliation,"" Bugti told The Express Tribune.
He vowed to ensure writ of the government.
Having resigned as the caretaker interior minister in December last year, the politician joined the ranks of the PPP.
Proposed by the PPP, Bugti garnered support from leaders such as Nawab Sanaullah Khan Zehri and Sardar Sarfaraz Chakar Domki of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
Based on the preliminary results of the 2024 nationwide elections, the PML-N secured the top position by winning 11 Balochistan Assembly seats, equivalent to the seats won by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).
Meanwhile, the PPP secured victories on 10 seats.
Post-election, the PML-N and PPP forged an alliance, pledging mutual support in forming governments at the national and provincial levels.
In the wake of the alliance and securing a majority in Sindh, the PPP announced its intention to establish its government in Balochistan.
The PML-N, along with the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and the Awami National Party (ANP), emerged as major coalition partners in the province.
On Friday evening, Balochistan Assembly Speaker Captain (retd) Khaliq Achakzai told media persons that Bugti was the new CM of Balochistan.
Backing Bugti on extending an olive branch to the disgruntled Baloch leaders, Achakzai said that no issue could be addressed without talks and the same formula would be applied in Balochistan. He hinted at action against those who were playing with the lives of innocent people.
In response to a question, Bugti, who was present, stated that merit would be ensured in all government departments and that nobody would be allowed to violate the merit.
He vowed that nobody would be allowed to sell government jobs.
""Those who are involved in selling jobs will be put behind bars,"" he warned.
Bugti said it was the worst precedent that jobs were being sold in Balochistan.
""I will stop this filthy process,"" he assured.
The PPP and PML-N have decided to form a coalition government in Balochistan.
The slot of the CM has been given to the PPP, whereas, the slot of the governor of Balochistan and speaker have been given to the PML-N.
The two parties emerged as the two largest parliamentary groups in the aftermath of the Feb 8 general elections.

6,Achakzai steals the show,"Regretted that some people wanted to turn the house, representing the people of Pakistan, into a cattle market"," 
Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP)’s leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai came to the newly-elected National Assembly on Friday with a purpose, as he not only demanded that Constitution should be respected, but also the supremacy of parliament be taken as the red line by all.
In his no-hold-barred speech, the PkMAP leader not only showed the courage to point out establishment’s role in politics and demanded that the interference should now stop. While admitting that the people have given mandate to jailed PTI leader Imran Khan, the veteran politician demanded that he should be released forthwith.
Referring to a line in oath, which states that the oath-taker would continue to abide by the Constitution and defend it, Achakzai said that everyone knows that the establishment continued to play with the Constitution, asking: “How could we defend the Constitution”.
Achakzai regretted that some people wanted to turn the house, representing the people of Pakistan, into a cattle market. Currently, Achakzai said that the politics had reached to a point where the one who was sold or the one, who was buying a politician, were considered loyals, but the one who refuses to become part of this sell and purchase was declared a traitor. “To hell with such approach,” he said.
Calling PPP a democratic party, recalling PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif used to raise the slogan of ‘Vote Ko Izzat Do [respect the vote] and stressing that Imran Khan had come in parliament via vote, Achakzai suggested that a resolution should be passed that “the establishment and security institutions will have no role in the politics of Pakistan.” It’s not a bad thing to suggest, he said, adding that all these parties admit that and were not oblivious to such interference.
In his speech, Achakzai said that the house should also pass a resolution that parliament will be the real source of Pakistan’s internal and external policies. “Only it [parliament] will make polices and no general will come in it,” he said amid desk thumping.
Emphasising the importance of having an army and intelligence agencies, Achakzai said that they themselves should show grace and truly disassociate themselves from politics, otherwise, people’s power would be utilised to push them back to garrisons.
Achakzai said that all the politicians from Jati Umra – the Sharifs brothers’ residence in Lahore – to the incarcerated PTI chairman would salute all the judges, politicians and political workers, who respected the Constitution, adding that all those who disrespected it were “Murdabad” [down with violators].
Addressing the newly-elected National Assembly Speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Achakzai said that parliament was attacked this time around as well, recalling that democratic and non-democratic forces had been fighting since Pakistan came into being.
He, however, lauded thousands of Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashtun and other political workers, who, while defying all odds, turn the tables on “yours and the generals’ plans” about the recently-concluded general elections.
“Otherwise, you all had already distributed all the key offices among yourselves,” he said, questioning: “If it all was inherited from one’s father.” He said: “Bravo those workers, regardless of their political affiliation,” adding that they swept away the system like a flood.
Recalling how judges were sent packing for opposing martial laws, he demanded that parliament should pass a resolution that all those judges, who opposed martial laws, should be declared “heroes of the Constitution”.
He demanded that their families should be given financial support, while those who supported martial laws should be stripped off of all the perks and privileges. This, he said, was the way forward to save and run Pakistan.
He demanded that all the common citizens, who sacrificed their lives for democracy should be declared “heroes and martyrs of democracy” regardless of their ethnicity or faith. He demanded that all the three major political parties – PMLN, PPPP and PTI – should say it on oath that parliament would be the real source of power and no general or spy agency would be allowed to interfere in politics.
He alleged that the men in uniform, who took bribes from anyone, should be sacked. “Judges, generals and all of us should repent for what we have done to Pakistan. The generals should continue working within their constitutional framework. “The people have high hopes from parliament.”
Referring to the votes that the PTI obtained in the general elections, Achakzai said when people of Pakistan gave vote to Imran Khan then changing it was treason with Pakistan and its people. He also demanded the release of Imran and others political workers, currently in jails.
