Book fairs, stalls displaying traditional foods, artifacts, handcrafts, and poetry recitals are part of the festival held at different departments and halls of the UoP.
Delegates from local colleges and universities turned up.
Dosti, a welfare organisation, arranged different activities on the opening day of the 10-day festival, which began at the varsity’s history department. 
Panelists at a group discussion asked students to understand the rapidly changing geopolitical situation in its true perspective and reclaim the tradition of dialogue culture through authentic references in history, art and folk literature.
Speakers through several panel discussions, author talks, and poetry recitals kept motivating the audience with their lively debates and fruitful interactions.
Keynote speaker Prof Razia Sultana shared her valuable views on ‘the relevance of history in contemporary times’, urging youth to have a genuine knowledge of the rapidly changing situation around them. 
Prof Faizullah Jan stressed the need for deconstructing narcissism through cross-cultural lens, while quoting from the celebrated book titled ‘Narcissism and Goldmund’ authored by Hermn Hesse, a noted German-Swiss writer. “Things should be understood in their true perspective and targets be set according to one’s own strength and correct vision,” he added.
At another debate, panelists dwelt on various aspects of Allama Iqbal’s masterpiece scholarly work ‘Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam’, while scholars also shed light on character building of students in the universities with focus on guiding youth on the right track towards a just and balanced society.
Noted scholars, including Sadia Ateeq, Asma Jamshed and Naheeda Begum, spoke at length on the topic ‘the role of schools in promotion of literature and culture’, asking teachers to help students participate in such healthy activities.
Prof Gulzar Jalal hosted a panel debate on the importance of Pashtun journal in the light of history, which served as mouthpiece of the Khudai Khidmatgar Tehreek launched by Bacha Khan in early 1930. 
Prof Syed Wiqar Ali Shah said the journal had ignited the spirit of freedom from British raj, saying it advocated the message of non-violence.

3,"Car crash, roof collapse kill six in rain-hit KP","Road closures, power suspension reported in province.","PESHAWAR: Rains and snowfall lashed wide areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Friday, killing six people and injuring six in separate incidents.
Five people were killed when a car they travelled in skidded off the downpour-slicked Karakoram Highway before falling into a deep ravine in the Torkamar area of Lower Kohistan district in Hazara Division.
“Four passengers lost their lives immediately after the accident, while another succumbed to injuries on the way to an Abbottabad hospital,” Rescue 1122 district head Sajid Ali told reporters.
The car carried passengers from Gilgit to Islamabad when the driver lost its control while negotiating a sharp turn on the Karakoram Highway.

Road closures, power suspension reported in province

The Rescue 1122 teams shifted the injured and the deceased to the Pattan civil hospital, where doctors referred one of the critically injured persons to the Ayub Medical Complex in Abbottabad. He died before reaching the health centre.
Spokesman for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmad Faizi said an eight-month-old girl was killed in a roof collapse in the Badhaber area on the outskirts of the provincial capital.
Three members of the family were injured in the incident.
Similarly, two people suffered minor injuries in another roof collapse incident in the Tajabad area of Peshawar. Also, a child was injured in a roof collapse in the Turganzai area of Charsadda district.
In the provincial capital, the rainwater accumulated on major arteries, including University Road, Kohat Road, and Assembly Chowk on the Khyber Road, causing a traffic mess.
The Peshawar Electric Supply Company said 190 of its power feeders tripped due to heavy rain, disrupting electric supply.
 


The public utility said its workers were trying to restore electric supply, but the continuous downpour had made their job difficult.
It asked the residents to cooperate with the company for an early resolution of the issue.
Rescue 1122 head in Lower Kohistan district Sajjad Ali said though it had been raining in the region since morning, the Karakoram Highway was open to traffic bound from Lower Kohistan to Upper Kohistan.
The rainfall started in Mansehra, Torghar, Abbottabad, Kolai-Palas, and Upper and Lower Kohistan districts early on Friday and continued intermittently all through the day.
The hilly and high-altitude parts of Kaghan Valley, the tourist resorts of Shogran and Konsh and Siren valleys in Mansehra, Kandia and Spat valleys in Kohistan, and Nathiagali received heavy snowfall that turned the weather cold.
The arteries linking the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road with hilly parts of Kaghan Valley were blocked by heavy snow and landslides, much to the misery of residents.

The hilltops received snowfall in Shahi, Binshahi, Laram Top, Luqman Banda, and Kalpani Maidan in the Lower Dir, and Kumrat, Dir Kohistan, Doog Dara, Barawal Top, Lowari Top, and Karo Dara in the Upper Dir. The Upper Dir administration asked transporters to avoid travelling to Chitral and the upper parts of the district without snow chains due to snow-slicked roads. The drivers were directed to take the mountainous roads at night and early in the morning during rain and snowfall.
In a statement, the administration said the National Highways Authority’s workers were on standby, while clearance of snow from the roads was in progress.
Also, the upper parts of Shangla district received snowfall, while rain lashed other parts of the region.

Torrential rains paralysed life in Bajaur tribal district on Friday. Link roads in several areas remained closed throughout the day.
Residents said torrential downpours coupled with heavy snowfall began in many hilly areas on Thursday evening, badly hitting life.
They said several link roads were closed to traffic due to the accumulation of rainwater.
The road closures were reported in the mountainous areas of Mamond, Nawagai, Barang, Salarzai, and Utmankhel tehsils.

“It’s like stepping into a fairy tale.”
Ali Hassan of Lahore said the experience of snowfall in Kalam was unexplainable.
“It feels like nature’s celebration, and I’m grateful to be part of it,” he said.

Roads were closed to traffic in Broghil, Rech, Khot, Terich, and Madak Lasht. Authorities stopped vehicular movement on the link roads of the Lowari Tunnel for the safety of travelers.

6,Sikandar opposes amendments to Irsa Act,PESHAWAR: Qaumi Watan Party provincial chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao on Friday said his party would resist...,"PESHAWAR: Qaumi Watan Party provincial chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao on Friday said his party would resist amendments to the Indus River System Authority Act, 1992.
“We won’t make any compromise on the rights of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and will offer strong resistance to any bid to amend the Irsa Act,” Mr Sikandar said in a statement issued by the party’s secretariat, Watan Kor, here.
He said the Indus River System Authority was established to monitor the distribution of water from the Indus River among federating units.
The QWP leader said that his party would continue its struggle to claim the rights of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as enshrined in the 1973 Constitution.
Without naming names, he said that some elements were conspiring to roll back the 18th Constitutional Amendment in an effort to do away with autonomy granted to provinces.
“We will resist any such bid to undo the 18th Amendment and deprive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of its due rights,” he said.
Mr Sikandar said that the 18th Constitutional Amendment was the first step towards the autonomy of provinces, and therefore, it would be protected at all costs.
He said that the rollback of the 18th Constitutional Amendment would create unrest among residents of smaller provinces, and that wouldn’t be a good omen for the federation.
The QWP leader said that “true” representatives of Pakhtuns were kept out of parliament through election rigging.
“We will not rest until the province gets its due rights,” he said.
Mr Sikandar said that the party’s leadership would raise its voice against injustices being meted out to the province.
He said that the QWP wouldn’t let Pakhtuns down and would continue to raise a voice for their rights.

8,Return of recently-displaced Khyber families not in sight,They insist living miserable life with limited resources,"KHYBER: With no time frame set for their return by authorities, most of over 300 families recently displaced from parts of Tirah and Upper Bara are living a miserable life in partially damaged houses with limited resources.
A total of 324 families from Sanda Pal, Miandad Kally, Kandaw, Khapur, Ghulam Ali, Dray Naghari, Jarrobi, Bagh-i-Haram, and Drowta villages, mostly inhabited by Sipas, Akkakhels, Zakhakhels, and Kamarkhels, hurriedly vacated their houses in mid-November last year when they were informed about the start of a military operation against suspected militants, who had reportedly taken refuge in these areas since June 2022.
The decision to shift residents to safer places ahead of a military operation was made after a string of terrorist attacks that martyred a lieutenant colonel and a number of soldiers.
Most of the displaced families took refuge in parts of Upper Bara, Bara-Kanjorai, Peshawar, and Jamrud, but authorities didn’t formally declare them internally displaced persons.

They insist living miserable life with limited resources

Rahman Gul of the Sanda Pal area told Dawn that he took his 12-member family to Speen Qabar Chowk in Bara last November but got no financial assistance from the district administration or the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.
He said that 67 families vacated their houses in the Sanda Pal area and had to cover long distances on foot as there was no road from their village to Bara.
“We were promised free transportation, food, tents, and necessary items of immediate use, but none of them was provided to us despite the passage of over three months,” he said.
The displaced person said he and other families were told by authorities that a military operation would be carried out in the area soon after their relocation to safer places, but a full-scale military operation had yet to be conducted.
He insisted that the displaced families were neglected by authorities.
Haji Lawang of Bagh-i-Haram told Dawn that for the third time in the last 12 years, the residents had to vacate their houses but got little assistance and relief from the government.
“It is a continuous injustice to us. Our house was destroyed by both militants and security forces twice. We’re told about military operations against militants ahead of our recent displacement,” he said.
Mr Lawang along with 17 other family members, currently lives with his relatives in an area on the outskirts of Peshawar.
He said the displaced families had lost more than half of their domestic animals; their children suffered from health issues, and their crops were ready for harvesting when they were ordered to leave, causing them huge financial losses.
The displaced person questioned the rationale for forcing families to vacate houses, saying he has yet to hear about any full-scale military operation in the region.
He insisted that calm had prevailed in the region since last November.
Sources in the region claimed that suspected militants had once again started targeting the houses of some local elders, retired security officials, or those whom they suspected of “working” for security forces.
When asked about the plight of IDPs, deputy commissioner of Khyber tribal district retired Captain Sanaullah Khan told Dawn that there were intelligence reports about the presence of suspected militants in the areas of displaced families.
“Intelligence-based operations are going on there. In the last three weeks, a number of local militant commanders have been eliminated. We cannot endanger the lives of displaced families for now by allowing them to return,” he said.
The DC said his administration conducted a survey about the whereabouts of newly displaced families and made contacts with the PDMA and non-governmental organisations for the assistance of those families.
“The Islamic Relief Pakistan has agreed to provide Rs13 million for distribution to all 324 families, with each getting Rs50,000 in the initial phase,” he said.
Mr Sanaullah also said the PDMA had been approached for cash handouts for those families, while the security agencies, too, were helping collect financial assistance.
He, however, said no time frame had been set for the return of displaced families to their houses.
“As soon as security officials inform us about the elimination of militants from the region, all possible arrangements will be made for the safe return of those families,” he said.

“We took up the residential complex and other major projects with the representatives of the Saudi Development Funds in a recent meeting at the Economic Affairs Division. They agreed to build the residential complex for our more than 500 doctors, paramedics, and other staff members,” Kath medical superintendent Dr Shahzad Ali Khan told reporters.
He said the King Mohammad Salman Residential Complex would be put up on the premises of the hospital.
Dr Shahzad said the hospital was rebuilt by Saudi authorities after a strong earthquake damaged it in 2005.

MS says Saudis have agreed to fund project

“If our employees, who come in from different parts of Hazara Division, get accommodation on the premises, they’ll attend to patients in a better way,” he said.
The MS said Saudis recently delivered 60 per cent of the pledged high-tech surgical and medical machines, beds, and other facilities to the hospital.
“We hope to get the rest of the machines shortly, improving patient care significantly,” he said.
Dr Shahzad said the hospital submitted proposals to the SDF for the establishment of a 120-bed maternal newborn and child health unit and a modern cardiology unit with a catheter laboratory.
“We recently set up a 10-bed kidney unit and launched dialysis services after getting high-tech machines from Saudi Arabia,” he said.
POWER CUTS: Traders in Mansehra city and its suburbs on Friday demanded of the Peshawar Electric Supply Company to do away with prolonged power outages.
Nasir Awan, Umar Khan Swati, Sheeraz Hussain, Mohammad Zubair and other traders told reporters that the prolonged and unscheduled power cuts had badly hit their businesses.
“Pesco resorts to daylong electricity supply in the name of maintenance of power lines,” he said.
He warned that if prolonged and unscheduled load shedding didn’t stop, traders would take to the streets.
“The federal government should take action to ensure uninterrupted power supply to our city and its suburbs,” he said.

Work on the power project has been suspended for a year owing to a dispute between the landowners and Peshawar Electric Supply Company, the executing agency of the energy project.
A committee of local people halted the work after the authorities’ failure to fulfill their promises under an agreement.
DC Rehman convened a jirga on Thursday to sort out the local people’s issues for early start of work on the power project.
The project director, officials of public health department and committee members were in attendance. 
On the occasion, the committee members said they wanted the agreement, which Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation (Pedo) had signed with them, implemented accordingly.
They said their foremost demand was provision of subsidised electricity to the three affected union councils, but Pedo was using delaying tactics.
They said they won’t allow resumption of work on the project unless their demands were met. The committee members also demanded of the DC to ask the relevant department to immediately initiate work on a promised water supply project for Dunai area.

At a presser on Thursday, Mr Zaman had warned to take over the operations of the company, wind it up and send its staff back to the TMA because the organisation had become a white elephant. He had termed the 2016 agreement between the TMA and WSSC as surprising. 
Under the agreement, the TMA employees worked under WSSC, but their salaries and pensions were paid by their parent organisation.

13,"PTI’s ex-lawmakers move high court against ‘non-provision’ of documents by ECP, ROs",Allege returning officers manipulated results in their constituencies.,"PESHAWAR: Three former lawmakers of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and contestants of general elections on Friday moved Peshawar High Court against non-provision of relevant election documents to them by Election Commission of Pakistan and the returning officers concerned.
Almost identical petitions were filed by former provincial ministers Kamran Khan Bangash and Taimoor Saleem Khan and ex-deputy speaker of the provincial assembly Mehmood Jan seeking directives of the court for ECP, Peshawar district returning officer and returning officers to forthwith provide them attested copies of Forms 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49 of their respective provincial assembly constituencies.
They have requested the court to declare as illegal the act of the said respondents of not providing them the attested copies of the said forms.
They have sought further directives of the court for the respondents to provide them CCTV footage of the consolidation proceedings by the returning officers of their constituencies.

Allege returning officers manipulated results in their constituencies

The petitioners Kamran Bangash, Taimoor Saleem and Mehmood Jan contested the Feb 8 general elections from PK-82, PK-79 and PK-72 constituencies respectively.
They claimed that as per the Form 45 received by their polling agents from the presiding officers in each of the polling stations, they had won against their rival candidates with a big margin. However, they stated that the returning officers concerned had manipulated the results and issued controversial Form 47 (provisional results) declaring their rivals as returned candidates.
The petitions, filed through senior lawyer Ali Gohar Durrani, include ECP through its secretary, the Peshawar district returning officer and the returning officers concerned as respondents.
The petitioners contended that the provisions of the Elections Act, 2017, were specifically violated as neither the said forms were uploaded on the ECP website as mandated by section 95 (10) nor they were allowed for public inspection of the documents as per section 100 of the Act.
The petitioners stated that following massive pre-poll rigging in various modes and forms, finally the polls were held on Feb 8.
They stated that after the closure of the polling process, which was marred by disruption of cellular phone service, the votes were finally counted and signed Form 45 were issued to the petitioners’ polling agents clearly reflecting the petitioners to have won the elections.
The petitioners claimed that following Form 45, they came for the result compilation for the provisional consolidation before the returning officer, however, entry was not allowed to them or their polling agents from 9pm on Feb 8 till 6am the next morning.
They stated that when entry was allowed to them they were merely told that they had ended up not as returned candidates, as was the requirement of Form 45 results, but instead their votes were reduced and other candidates were declared as returned on the basis of some manipulated Form 45, which despite the clear mandate of the Elections Act, 2027, had not been shared with the petitioners.
The petitioners informed that they had approached the high court for issuing directives to the respondents for consolidation of the results on the basis of Form 45 so issued by the presiding officers and the court had then issued directives in this regard.
However, they stated that ECP had rejected their respective petitions through short order while no detailed reasoning was yet available. They stated that the ECP had directed the petitioners to approach the election tribunals.
They contended that they had written applications to the ROs, DRO and also the district election commissioner (DEC) seeking the attested copies of Form 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49. However, they added, the respondents had been shifting the burden on each other for the purpose.
They contended that finally the DEC had written to the DRO to share the attested copies of the forms so requested with the petitioners by giving reason that the forms were still in the custody of the ROs.
The petitioners claimed that this had left absolute credible stigma on the whole process, as not only the petitioners were disallowed their legal mandate of being declared the returned candidate, but they were also deprived of the attested copies of the said forms leaving the election material with the ROs so that they could further manipulate the election results.
The petitioners have also referred to different judgments of the superior courts in support of their contentions.
They have also referred to Article 19-A of the Constitution guaranteeing the rights of every citizen to access information in all matters of public importance, subject only to reasonable restrictions imposed by the law.
