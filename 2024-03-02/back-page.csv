1,"US blocks UN Security Council move to condemn Israel, again",Palestinian Authority’s envoy to the UN says 14 members supported the statement drafted by Algeria.,"UNITED NATIONS: The US blocked a statement in the UN Security Council that would have blamed Israeli forces for the killings of civilians scrambling for food aid during a chaotic incident in Gaza City.
In a late-night session at the UN Security Council, Arab nations faced significant resistance from the US when they pushed for the statement, accusing Israel of “intentionally targeting and killing” over 100 Gazans.
The statement urged the council members to “express deep concern on reports stating that over 100 individuals have lost their lives, with approximately 750 others sustaining injuries due to opening fire by Israeli forces”.
 
 

“We don’t have all the facts on the ground. That’s the problem,” said US Deputy Envoy to the UN Robert Wood following consultations with the 15-member council late Thursday afternoon.
The Israeli military claimed victims, rushing for aid, trampled each other, and some were run over by convoy vehicles.
The statement faced a daunting task as it required unanimous agre­e­ment from all council members to pass, and with US history of vetoing moves that target Israel, the consensus was unlikely.
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority’s envoy to the UN, said 14 members supported the statement drafted by Algeria.
After meeting with US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Mr Mansour implored the Security Council to condemn the killing and pursue those responsible for the alleged massacre.
“I think her heart is in the right place, but she is an official of an administration that receives instructions from Washington, D.C.,” Mr Mansour said while referring to the US envoy.
Speaking soon after the incident, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed shock and criticised the Security Coun­cil’s paralysis.

2,Thousands attend Navalny funeral despite warnings,Protesters chant slogans against war in Ukraine,"MOSCOW: Thousands of mourners attended the funeral of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow on Friday, two weeks after President Vladimir Putin’s top critic died in an Arctic prison.
Many carried flowers and shouted support for the 47-year-old anti-corruption campaigner who galvanised mass protests against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the hearse arrived at a church for a short religious service.
A crowd gathered near the cemetery where Navalny was later buried on Friday shouted a series of slogans against the Kremlin and its offensive in Ukraine. 
“No to war!” the crowd yelled, along with “Down with the power of murderers!” and “We will not forgive!” as many of Navalny’s supporters blame Putin for the death of his top critic.

Protesters chant slogans against war in Ukraine

Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, paid tribute to her husband on X shortly after his burial on Friday, thanking him for “26 years of absolute happiness”. 
She wrote: “I don’t know how to live without you, but I will try my best to make you up there happy for me and proud of me. I don’t know if I’ll manage it or not, but I will try.” 
The Kremlin, which has denied involvement and dismissed the accusations as “hysterical”, warned against “unauthorised” protests around the funeral.
The body first lay in an open casket in a packed church in Maryino, southern Moscow, for a ceremony attended by his parents.
The coffin was closed immediately after the service. The coffin was then transported to the Borisovo cemetery, near the banks of the Moskva River, where several large wreaths were arranged around the grave. “We won’t forget you!” and “Forgive us!” some mourners shouted as the coffin arrived for burial.
‘What are they afraid of?’ 
Some 400 mourners have been detained at Navalny memorials since his death, rights organisation OVD-Info has said, and there was concern of more arrests at the funeral where a heavy police presence could be seen.
“Any unauthorised gatherings will be in violation of the law and those who participate in them will be held responsible,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to TASS news agency.
The French, German and US ambassadors were seen among mourners outside the church, as were some of Russia’s last free independent politicians.
The dissident’s widow, who is outside Russia and did not attend his funeral service, earlier said she feared the funeral could be disrupted by further arrests. Navalnaya has blamed Putin for her husband’s death.
Putin’s spokesman Peskov has criticised the accusations made by her and some Western leaders as “vulgar”.
On the day of the funeral, Peskov said he had “nothing to say” to the family of the deceased.
‘Nothing to say’ 
Navalny shot to prominence through his anti-corruption campaigning, exposing what he said was rampant graft at the top of Putin’s administration.
Some mourners mentioned the huge influence Navalny had on their own political activism.
“Because of him I began to get involved in politics... He was the first public person that I listened to,” said 26-year-old Denis, a volunteer at a charity.
Navalny was arrested in January 2021 when he returned to Russia from Germany. “Alexei was tortured for three years” before his death, Navalnaya told lawmakers in Brussels.
“He was starved in a tiny stone cell, cut off from the outside world and denied visits, phone calls, and then even letters.” “And then they killed him. Even after that, they abused his body,” she said.
His body was held in a morgue for eight days before being returned to the family, which Navalny’s team believed to be a bid to cover up responsibility for his death.
His family and his team have also accused authorities of trying to prevent a dignified public burial, fearing it could turn into a flashpoint for dissent.

3,Left-wing firebrand George Galloway wins UK by-election,Workers Party leader put Gaza conflict front and centre in his campaign.,"ROCHDALE: Left-wing firebrand George Gallo­way was elected to the UK parliament on Friday after tapping into anger over the Israel-Hamas war in a by-election.
Galloway, 69, first became an MP in 1987 and will return to the House of Commons for the first time since 2015 after winning the seat of Roc­hdale, in the north of England, by nearly 6,000 votes.
The vote saw the main opposition Labour party withdraw its candidate, Azhar Ali, after he touted a conspiracy theory that Israel had allowed Hamas to carry out its attack on October 7.
Galloway put the Gaza conflict front and centre of his campaign in Rochdale, which has a 30 per cent Muslim population.
 







Workers Party leader put Gaza conflict front and centre in his campaign

“Keir Starmer, this is for Gaza,” Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Great Britain, said in his victory speech, referring to the Labour party’s leader.
“You have paid, and you will pay, a high price for the role that you have played in enabling, encouraging and covering for the catastrophe presently going on in occupied Palestine in the Gaza Strip,” he added.
The Scottish-born Gall­o­way, nicknamed “Gorge­ous George”, has had a long and chequered political career, in which he has represented several parties, including Labour.
He sparked controversy in the 1990s when he visited then-Iraq leader Saddam Hussein, telling him: “Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability”.
Galloway gained international attention in 2005 when he was called to testify over Iraq in the US Senate. He had earlier been expelled from Labour over his stance on the war.
His majority of 5,697 votes in Rochdale amou­nted to 18.3 per cent of the total, on a turnout of 39.7 per cent.
The surprise runner-up was David Tully, a local businessman and independent candidate.
It is very rare for none of the main parties to finish in first and second place.

4,Musk sues OpenAI over ‘betrayal of mission’,"Musk has accused Microsoft of controlling OpenAI several times, with both firms denying the claims.","PARIS: Elon Musk has launched a legal case against OpenAI, the AI firm he helped to set up in 2015, accusing its leaders of a “betrayal” of its founding mission.
The tycoon, who left OpenAI in 2018, argued in documents filed in a San Francisco court late on Thursday that firm was always intended as a non-profit entity. But he said recent boardroom changes meant OpenAI was now effectively a subsidiary of software giant Microsoft, arguing that this was breach of contract.
Musk has accused Microsoft of controlling OpenAI several times, with both firms denying the claims.
OpenAI captured the public imagination in late 2022 with the release of its chatbot ChatGPT, which can generate passable poems and essays and even succeed in exams. The firm has also developed image and video generating tools that are seen as the leaders in their field.
The success of its products has helped attract huge investment into AI, which boosters say could transform every aspect of human life.
Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI since 2019, poured billions more into the firm last year.
And the software giant stepped in when OpenAI’s board fired CEO Sam Altman in November last year, hiring him and offering to house any staff members who were unhappy with his ousting.
 
 

The OpenAI board later climbed down, Altman was reinstated and several board members were replaced.
‘Calamitous implications’
OpenAI started life as a non-profit dedicated to developing “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), a vague term loosely defined as a kind of AI that would far outstrip human capabilities on all measures of intelligence.
The idea was for OpenAI to guarantee that such technology would be safe for humanity.
But Musk’s legal case said this founding principle had been “turned on its head”, accusing OpenAI of continuing in secrecy “towards a profit-centric future with possible calamitous implications for humanity”.
The changes to OpenAI in 2023 were “a stark betrayal of the Founding Agreement, turning that Agreement on its head and perverting OpenAI Inc’s mission”, the filing stated.
The document pointed out that OpenAI still claimed to be pursuing AGI that “benefits all of humanity”.
“In reality, however, OpenAI Inc has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft.” Musk is asking the court for compensation, to force OpenAI’s leaders to make their research open to the public and ban them — or Microsoft —  from making a profit from the technology.
Since leaving OpenAI, Musk has joined the chorus of critics warning that superintelligence could spell the end for humanity. He also launched his own AI firm, xAI, last year and said he wanted to raise $1billion from investors.

5,Ambani’s pre-wedding party draws world’s who’s who,"Zuckerberg, Rihanna in India; Disney and Microsoft giants among those expected to join celebrations","JAMNAGAR: Rihanna and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg were in India on Friday for an extravagant pre-wedding party hosted by Asia’s richest man, with celebrations expected to include other globally influential figures.
Global tech bosses, industry titans, Bollywood stars, pop stars and politicians are also due for the three-day gala celebrations hosted by billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani.
This weekend’s party is an elaborate pre-wedding ceremony for younger son Anant and fiancee Radhika Merchant, the daughter of wealthy pharmaceutical moguls.
Photos published by Indian media confirmed the arrival of Rihanna, Zuckerberg and the Facebook founder’s wife Priscilla Chan in Ambani’s hometown of Jamnagar, along with former US president Donald Trump’s eldest daughter Ivanka.

“Umbrella” singer Rihanna, who gave birth to her second child in August, is slated to lead Friday’s entertainment in her first public performance since last year’s Superbowl.

Broadcaster India Today reported that the Barbadian-born musician and women’s beauty entrepreneur had been offered up to $9 million to appear at the event.
Ambani, 66, is chairman of Reliance Industries — India’s biggest company by market capitalisation — and the world’s 10th-richest person, according to the Forbes billionaires list, worth more than $116 billion.
He inherited a thriving industrial enterprise spanning oil, gas and petrochemicals from his father and grew it into a commercial behemoth with lucrative interests in retail, telecommunications and an Indian Premier League cricket team.
Reliance’s partnerships with storied fashion brands such as Burberry, Armani and Jimmy Choo have helped the conglomerate cater to the growing appetite for luxury goods among India’s middle class.
Ambani’s family home Antilia — a 27-floor skyscraper that reportedly cost more than $1 billion to build and has a permanent staff of 600 servants — is one of the most prominent landmarks of Mumbai.
It was criticised after its 2010 completion by author Arundhati Roy and others for starkly illustrating the wide gulf between India’s business elite and its poor multitudes.
Ambani held the most expensive wedding in India to date for his daughter in 2018, which reportedly cost $100 million and saw US pop megastar Beyonce perform.
Younger son Anant, 28, who also serves as a director on the boards of several Reliance-owned firms, is expected to marry Merchant, 29, later this year.
The Ambanis kick-started celebrations on Wednesday by launching a three-day feast for villagers at the Reliance Township in Jamnagar, in India’s western state of Gujarat.
Star-studded guest list
US illusionist David Blaine is also expected to be part of the entertainment for guests, who include Microsoft founder Bill Gates and several current and former political leaders.
Also among the invitees is Disney chief Bob Iger, following a deal agreed between Reliance Industries and Walt Disney on Wednesday to merge their Indian media businesses. The merger will create an $8.5 billion entertainment giant in the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy.
Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, cricket greats Sachin Tendulkar and M.S. Dhoni, and industry titan Gautam Adani are also invited.
The main celebrations, running until Sunday, will have different themes, events and dress codes — including a “jungle fever” day with a visit to an animal rescue centre run by Ambani, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported.
