Even with no other cities in the running for the 2034 Games, Salt Lake City organisers have been cautious in their approach to the bidding process but could not contain their excitement as they hit a button submitting the formal application to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
Salt Lake City 2034 and France 2030 were picked as preferred hosts for the Winter Olympics in November.
Included in the Preferred Host Submission were Salt Lake’s Games vision and concept along with site plans, sustainability studies and financial information.
Federal, state, and local government guarantees and venue use, lodging, and marketing rights agreements will be submitted in late March.
The Utah capital, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 2002, had initially wanted to bid for the 2030 Games but dropped plans due to it being too close to the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
“Today was such a monumental day in our journey to bring the Games back to Utah,” said Fraser Bullock, President and CEO of the Salt Lake City — Utah Committee for the Games (SLC-UT).
“Since the 2002 Games, sport has been a legacy in Utah that has helped define who we are.
“Looking ahead to 2034, we are uniting under a vision to truly elevate our communities, winter sport, and the Games experience.”
There are still steps to be navigated before the IOC votes on the 2034 host on July 24 in Paris ahead of the start of the Summer Games but with no other bids the process should be a formality.
SLC-UT even requested that the IOC take the vote on July 24 to coincide with Pioneer Day in Utah, a state holiday.
The IOCs Future Host Commission is scheduled to visit Salt Lake City from April 9-13 to tour venues and evaluate preparations before submitting a report to the Executive Board which will determine if the bid should be put to a vote by the full membership.
“We think we will blow them away,” said Bullock.  “We are very, very pleased with what we have to offer.
“If we receive a positive vote after our presentation then we would go right to signing the Olympic host contract right there.
“That will be a very special day for us.”

1,Williams brothers lead Bilbao into Copa del Rey final,BILBAO: Brothers Inaki and Nico Williams scored to help Athletic Bilbao secure a 3-0 semi-final win over Atletico...,"BILBAO: Brothers Inaki and Nico Williams scored to help Athletic Bilbao secure a 3-0 semi-final win over Atletico Madrid on Thursday and a 4-0 aggregate victory that sent the Basque side into their third Copa del Rey final in the last five years.
Bilbao, who reached their 40th Spanish cup final, will bid to end a 40-year title drought in Seville on April 6, when they face Mallorca who beat Real Sociedad 5-4 on penalties on Tuesday.
Ernesto Valverde’s Bilbao team punished the visitors with clinical counter-attacks, playing with the advantage of having won the first leg 1-0 in Madrid.
In need of a goal to stay alive and missing France forward Antoine Griezmann due to an ankle injury, it was mission impossible for Atletico against opponents who had not dropped a point at home since October.
Not even the pouring rain could spoil Athletic’s showdown in Bilbao, where they were roared on by a raucous San Mames Stadium packed of 52,000 adoring fans, the highest attendance in the club’s history.
The home side dominated from the start against a subdued Atletico, with the jet-heeled Williams brothers a constant menace.
They struck in the 13th minute when Nico burst up the left wing before crossing for his brother Inaki who unleashed a superb volley into the top corner.
Bilbao attacked again in the 42nd minute and Inaki Williams set up Nico for a simple close-range finish.
“Our connection is real and it’s working very well, we understand each other,” Nico Williams told TVE.
“I’m delighted, it’s a dream to reach the final and to do it in front of our fans that were fantastic as always. Athletic can do it all and hopefully win the final.”
Bilbao continued to dominate and Gorka Guruzeta wrapped up a 10th consecutive home win in all competitions for the Basque side from a rebound in the 61st minute.
It was another disappointing result for Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid who have won only one of their last seven competitive games.
They are fourth in La Liga on 52 points, 13 behind leaders Real Madrid, and will be under pressure when they host Serie A leaders Inter Milan after losing the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
“The Champions League, it’s a difficult, complicated competition that requires strength, but who knows...?,” Simeone told TVE.

3,Kipchoge lauds Kiptum ahead of Tokyo Marathon,TOKYO: Double Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge on Friday paid tribute to Kelvin Kiptum after the world...,"TOKYO: Double Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge on Friday paid tribute to Kelvin Kiptum after the world record-holder died last month when his car crashed into a tree.
Kipchoge is preparing to compete in Sunday’s Tokyo Marathon in his first race since Kenyan compatriot Kiptum was killed on Feb 11 at the age of 24.
Kiptum died just months after beating Kipchoge’s world record and the two were expected to face off for the first time at this year’s Paris Olympics.
The 39-year-old Kipchoge said it was  “unfortunate that he left here”.
“His career was in high spirits and he was really running on a high level,” he said.
Although Kiptum only competed in three marathons, he won all of them and posted three of the seven fastest times in history.
The father of two was driving in the Rift Valley, the heartland of Kenyan distance running, when his car careered off the road.
Police said Kiptum and his Rwandan coach Gervais Hakizimana were killed on the spot while a woman passenger was injured.
Kiptum’s death shocked Kenya and the world of athletics.
Kipchoge said this year’s Olympic marathon would be  “a little bit different” following Kiptum’s death. “There were high expectations,” he said.
Kiptum ran a time of two hours and 35 seconds at the Chicago Marathon last October to slice 34 seconds off Kipchoge’s previous world record.
He stood on the podium alongside Chicago women’s champion Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands.
Kipchoge returns to Tokyo for the first time since breaking the course record in 2022 in 2:02:40.
His strongest challenge in this year’s race is expected to come from fellow Kenyans Vincent Ngetich, Timothy Kiplagat and Benson Kipruto.

Meilutyte is the world record holder and reigning world champion in 50-metre breaststroke, which is not held at the Olympics, and won 100-metre gold at London 2012 as a 15-year-old.
She was 100-metre world champion in 2023 but failed to reach the semi-finals at last month’s world championships in Doha.
The federation said on their website that Meilutyte had undergone surgery in Kaunas after returning from Qatar.
“Ruta’s foot has been hurting for several months during heavy physical exertion. After carrying out the tests, we found damage to the first metatarsal bone of the left foot,” it quoted orthopaedic surgeon Gintautas Pocius as saying.
“Since the operation is a minimally invasive arthroscopy, we expect a quick rehabilitation process.”
The federation said Meilutyte would have to wear a special brace for three weeks.
“The procedure will not disrupt the normal preparation plan for the Paris Olympics. In any case, a two to three week rest is planned after the world championships in Doha,” it added.
The Paris Olympics open on July 26.

7,Medvedev cruises into Dubai semi-finals,DUBAI: Daniil Medvedev raced to victory over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina on Thursday to reach the Dubai Tennis...,"DUBAI: Daniil Medvedev raced to victory over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina on Thursday to reach the Dubai Tennis Championship semi-finals and continue his excellent start to the year.
The world number four wasted little time in wrapping up a 6-2, 6-3 win and will face Ugo Humbert in the last four.
“Alejandro can play very well,” Medvedev said.  “Sometimes during matches he can have a little down moment and then he goes up.
“I knew that no matter the score, I needed to go until the last point.”
The Russian is playing in just his second tournament of the season after reaching the Australian Open final, where he suffered an agonising defeat by Jannik Sinner after leading by two sets.
Reigning champion Medvedev is bidding to defend an ATP title for the first time, having won 20 trophies at Tour-level events in his career but all at different tournaments.
Medvedev eased through the opening set with breaks in the sixth and eighth games.
He powered into a 4-0 lead in the second and sealed victory on his first match point, despite a brief rally from Davidovich Fokina, who has now lost all four of his meetings with Medvedev.
Medvedev had to come from a set down against Lorenzo Sonego in the previous round, but said he may have been struggling with an illness.
“I don’t know what happened yesterday. A few people around me got a small virus, so maybe it is this,” he said. “Some days that happens but I am happy today happened. I am not at my best shape yet but we have some more matches.”
Fifth-seeded Humbert of France saved three match points in the second-set tie-break on his way to a 3-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-3 victory against third seed Hubert Hurkacz of Poland.
Humbert, who hit 24 winners, had also defeated Hurkacz en route to the title in Marseille earlier this month.
Alexander Bublik and Andrey Rublev will meet in the other semi-final after both were beneficiaries of retirements in their last-eight matches.
Kazakhstan’s Bublik led 6-4, 4-1 when his opponent Jiri Lehecka quit their tie with injury.
Second seed Rublev was 6-4, 4-3 ahead when American Sebastian Korda left the court in the second quarter-final.
The win ended a run of three successive quarter-final exits for world number five Rublev.

8,HBL PSL 2024 Karachi upbeat despite setbacks in ‘rebuilding’ season,"KARACHI: A below-par show against Islamabad United, helplessness against a late onslaught by Quetta Gladiators and,...","KARACHI: A below-par show against Islamabad United, helplessness against a late onslaught by Quetta Gladiators and, sandwiched between both, a stomach bug affecting more than half of their squad have marred Karachi Kings’ homecoming so far.
The HBL Pakistan Super League franchise has been hit by adversity after winning two matches of the ongoing edition in a row following the defeat in their opening fixture.
Considering that the Kings are undergoing what they have called a “rebuilding” phase after missing out on the playoffs in the last two seasons, the start hasn’t been too bad — they won only three matches in the whole of the previous edition.
But their defeats against United and the Gladiators in their first two matches here at the National Bank Stadium were definitely setbacks they would be looking to bounce back from if they are to rise from their current fifth position in the standings with half of their league stage matches behind them.
Karachi could have been in a better place had Quetta’s Sherfane Rutherford not subjected them to a match-winning blitz on a night where the depleted home side gave it all on Thursday.
They face tougher opponents in table-toppers Multan Sultans on Sunday — the two-day break expected to help their players recover and a potential training session on Saturday for the squad to regroup under new captain Shan Masood.
“… with this tournament, you have close games, and obviously, we get a bit of a break now, a few trainings which will be good for the lads,” Karachi opener Tim Seifert told reporters after the drubbing by Quetta. “But, obviously looking at the table as well, we’re still very much in the tournament.”
Seifert, the New Zealander who is featuring for the first time in Pakistan, was behind the wickets when Rutherford and Akeal Hosein were snatching it away from the Kings and believed team-mates could have done better with the ball. 
“Yeah, obviously they hit the ball very cleanly, but I think at the same time we probably didn’t quite execute,” he observed “We potentially gave them a couple too many balls that they could hit for six. 
In close games like that, it does come down to one ball. I think it was one of those games where we were on top, and then they came back.” 
The well-built right-hander believed it was important for Karachi to keep their heads high and look at the bigger picture to restore the confidence within the dressing room.
“Sometimes that’s cricket, and also that’s T20 cricket,” he said. “Unfortunately, we’re on the wrong side, but the boys are still very confident, and we’re still in the running to make the top four, which is the main thing.” 
Seifert, who is one of the very few high-profile international players taking part in the current edition of the PSL, was upbeat about Karachi’s squad depth in the face of illness that has struck the team. 
“… we’ve lost a couple of our players with illness, but you know that’s part of life as well,” he noted. “Some people get sick, but yeah, it doesn’t matter who the starting XI is; everyone’s capable of doing the job, and everyone’s backed in the squad to perform.”

9,Australia take charge after Green’s rearguard action,The Black Caps lost wickets in clumps as they reeled in the face of Australia’s attack with Glenn Phillips’s aggressive 71 serving.,"WELLINGTON: Australia dismissed New Zealand for 179 to take control of the first Test on Friday’s second day after Cameron Green had scored a brilliant 174 not out in a defiant final-wicket partnership to drive the tourists to 383 all out.
The Black Caps lost wickets in clumps as they reeled in the face of Australia’s attack with Glenn Phillips’s aggressive 71 serving only to save the home side from deeper embarrassment in front of a sell-out crowd at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.
Australia chose not to enforce the follow-on but the wickets kept falling with skipper Tim Southee dismissing Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne cheaply as the shadows across the ground lengthened.
Nightwatchman Nathan Lyon was dropped by Southee in the slips off the last ball of the day and will resume on six not out alongside Usman Khawaja, who was unbeaten on five. Australia are on 13 for two, leading by 217 runs.
New Zealand, looking for only a second win over their neighbours in 24 Tests this century, had started the day hoping to quickly remove the final Australian wicket but Green and Josh Hazlewood refused to yield for two hours.
All-rounder Green, who had reached the century mark for the second time in Tests on the penultimate ball of day one, continued to play his shots, smashing 23 fours and five sixes in a marathon 275-ball innings.
Hazlewood contributed 22 off 62 balls at the other end as the pair combined for 116 runs before seamer Matt Henry finally winkled out the Aust­ralian paceman to claim his second test five-wicket haul (5-70).
“Obviously Greeny did the bulk of the work but it was good to be at the other end watching that sort of innings,” said Hazlewood.
“For his career, it can be huge, I think, his second hundred for Australia on that sort of wicket against that sort of attack. Outstanding.”
Australia’s final tally was bolstered by 41 extras, which inclu­ded 20 wides, but New Zealand’s profligacy was not to be limited to their fielding and they were quickly reduced to 12-3.
Tom Latham played on to depart for five and two balls later Kane Williamson ran himself out for a duck after bumping into his batting partner Will Young while Labuschagne was wrecking the stumps with a direct hit.
Three balls later and Rachin Ravindra was also sent back with zero runs to his name after a fine Nathan Lyon catch off the bowling of Hazlewood.
Australia skipper Pat Cumm­ins triggered the next collapse when he had Daryl Mitchell caught behind with the final ball of one over and Mitchell Marsh ended Young’s innings with the first ball of the next to leave the hosts on 29-5.
Phillips and Tom Blundell steadied the sinking ship with a partnership of 84 but Lyon (4-43) brought an end to that when he had the latter caught for 33 off an inside edge.
Two balls later, Scott Kugge­leijn became the off spinner’s second victim and the home side were again on the ropes at 113-7.
Hazlewood finally found the way to evict Phillips with a short delivery the batsman top-edged to Starc in the deep and when Lyon stopped Henry’s pugnacious innings on 42, the end was not long coming.
“Cam Green and Hazlewood did really well and that’s obviously not exactly ideal for us,” said Phillips.
“The pitch is still doing a little bit and that new ball definitely brings us into the game quite a lot.”
The second and final Test in Christchurch begins on March 8.

10,Rain threatens washout of PSL matches in Pindi,The continuing downpour meant no practice sessions could be held on Friday at the Islamabad Club Cricket Ground ahead of matches.,"ISLAMABAD: The forecast of heavy rains in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad threatens to disrupt both matches of the HBL Pakistan Super League scheduled at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday.
The continuing downpour meant no practice sessions could be held on Friday at the Islamabad Club Cricket Ground ahead of matches between Babar Azam’s Peshawar Zalmi and two-time defending champions Lahore Qalandars and the one between home side Islamabad United and Quetta Gladiators.
“There are reports of heavy rain for Saturday, so it seems there is a prospect of a washout ... lets see what happens,” a Pakistan Cricket Board official told Dawn.
The official informed that if rain was to stop and the pitch allowed for matches to be held for shortest period, organisers will try their best for a result. “But, chances of improvement in weather are minimal,” he added.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department had already forecast rain with thunderstorms in various areas including Rawalpindi and Islamabad from February 29 to March 2.
Saturday’s matches were the first in this edition of the T20 league to be held in Pindi, where United and Zalmi historically enjoy good support from the crowd. Seven matches after the double-header are also scheduled to be played in Pindi, with Karachi set to host the finals stage.

11,Ireland beat Afghanistan to claim maiden Test victory,Captain Andy Balbirnie led from the front with an undefeated 58 as Ireland reached their modest target of 111 in the final session of the third day.,"ABU DHABI: Ireland fina­lly won their first Test match on Friday when they defeated Afghanistan by six wickets in Abu Dhabi, ending a streak of seven successive losses.
Captain Andy Balbirnie led from the front with an undefeated 58 as Ireland reached their modest target of 111 in the final session of the third day.
Ireland had played their first Test back in 2018 when they were defeated by Pakistan.
“We’re absolutely excited. We’ve created history. The monkey is off the back and it’s very special to do that,” said Balbirnie whose team were wobbling at 13-3 at one stage.
“Obviously there were nerves; we were chasing our first win. You ask this whole group how special this is. A lot of our guys didn’t get to play Test cricket. Hopefully people back home want to be Test cricketers.”
Afghanistan resumed their second innings on Friday on 134-3 before they were dismissed for 218.
Skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi top scored with 55 while Rahmanullah Gurbaz, making his Test debut, hit 46.
Mark Adair picked up three wickets to finish with eight for the match. Craig Young and Barry McC­arthy also claimed three apiece.
Gurbaz, better known for his flamboyant and explosive shot-making in limited overs cricket, clubbed the only two sixes of the innings.
Chasing just 111 for victory, Ireland were in trouble with three wickets down for just 13 runs with 18-year-old fast bowler Naveed Zadran clean-bowling opener Peter Moor and Curtis Campher, both without scoring.
Balbirnie denied the teenager a hat-trick but Harry Tec­tor was soon caught behind by Gurbaz off Nijat Masood for two.
Balbirnie and Paul Stirling, who both played in Ireland’s debut Test in 2018, briefly steadied dressing room nerves.
Stirling was then caught in the slips off spinner Zia-ur-Rehman for 14 as Irel­a­nd slipped to 39-4 just after tea.
However, Balbirnie moved watchfully to his fourth Test half-century, which came from 86 balls, ably supported by Lor­can Tucker (27 not out) in a crucial winning partnership of 72.
“I think the first day, when we were batting, we let ourselves down,” said Shahidi. “The Irish seamers were bowling very well but we threw our wickets away.” He added:  “We have some positives. Gurbaz was very positive on debut.
Naveed had had a good Test against Sri Lanka, and in this match also he did very well.”
Irish fast bowler Adair said he was  “buzzing” with the victory.
“Test cricket is pretty difficult. I think we’ve got a really good bowling group,” he said.
The two teams will now play three ODIs and three T20 games as part of their multi-format series.

Charles Leclerc’s Ferrari will start alongside Verstappen on the front row for Saturday’s first of 24 races this year.
Verstappen’s 33rd career pole and third in Bahrain was a welcome boost for the Red Bull team.
The Mercedes of George Russell and Carlos Sainz in the other Ferrari fill the second row. Sergio Perez in the second Red Bull and Fernando Alonso’s Aston Martin occupy the third row.
Then came Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in the McLarens, with Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) and Nico Hulk­enberg (Haas) completing top 10.

13,City face United test as Liverpool kids prosper,LONDON: Erling Haaland has Manchester United in his sights this weekend as Manchester City host their cross-town...,"LONDON: Erling Haaland has Manchester United in his sights this weekend as Manchester City host their cross-town rivals at the start of a season-defining spell for the Premier League champions.
Pep Guardiola’s men, chasing an unprecedented fourth strai­ght English top-flight crown, boast an impressive recent record against United but know they cannot afford a slip-up in a tight title tussle.
Leaders Liverpool are strongly fancied to see off struggling Nottingham Forest despite their injury problems, while free-scoring Arsenal face relegation-threatened Sheffield United.The Manchester derby appeared to be shaping up to be a tasty face-off between Haaland and Rasmus Hojlund until the in-form United forward sustained a muscle injury.
Norway international Haaland scored five times in the 6-2 FA Cup win against Luton Town in midweek to take his tally to 27 in 30 appearances in all competitions this season despite two months out injured.
In stark contrast Marcus Rashford, United’s leading man last season, has mustered just five goals, leaving his side blunt in attack at the Etihad in the absence of Hojlund, who is likely to be missing on Sunday.
City manager Pep Guardiola warned the United game would be  “completely different” from their Luton romp but in truth the derby, while a blockbuster clash on paper, has become one-sided in recent years.
City have won five of the past six matches against their local rivals in all competitions, scoring 18 goals.
Haaland has developed a taste for playing against United, netting five times against them in four meetings — including a hat-trick at the Etihad last season.
Guardiola’s men face Liver­pool, Newcastle United and Ars­e­nal after the United game but, with Haaland in his current form, any fixture looks winnable.
Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool keep finding ways to win despite a punishing injury list that has deprived them of many top stars.
Lewis Koumas scored on his debut and fellow 18-year-old Jayden Danns registered his first two goals as a depleted Liverpool side beat Southampton 3-0 at Anfield in the FA Cup in midweek.
The win came just days after an under-strength team beat Chelsea at Wembley to win the League Cup — in what they hope is the first of four trophies in Klopp’s final season at the helm.
The Premier League pacesetters, who travel to relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest on Saturday, have a chance to stretch their lead, with City and Arsenal not in action until Sun­day and Monday, respectively.
Klopp said Liverpool were reaping the rewards from a style of play that has been adopted right throughout the club.
“It’s special,” said Klopp.  “And, of course, it’s for me strange as well, I never had that before — that you play with that many kids and still can win football games. It’s a really interesting experience, to be honest.”
Arsenal look almost certain to win a seventh consecutive Premier League match against bottom club Sheffield United at the Emirates on Monday.
This time last season the Gunners had launched a winning run that looked like it might take them to a first top-flight title since 2004, before a late-season collapse allowed City to claim the title.
The recent glut of goals — 25 in their past six league matches — means Arsenal have scored 62 goals in the Premier League this season, one fewer than Liverpool, and they now have the best goal difference.
The Gunners have spread the goals out but Bukayo Saka has hit form at the perfect time, with seven league goals in his past five games to take his season’s league tally to 13.
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has urged his team to stay  “ruthless and efficient” in the drive towards the finish line and at the moment they look like the real deal.
Fixtures (1500 GMT unless stated): Saturday: Brentford v Chelsea, Everton v West Ham United, Fulham v Brighton and Hove Albion, Newcastle United v Wolverhampton Wanderers, Nottingham Forest v Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur v Crystal Palace, Luton Town v Aston Villa (1730); Sunday Burnley v Bournemouth (1300), Manchester City v Manchester United (1530); Monday Sheffield United v Arsenal (2000).
