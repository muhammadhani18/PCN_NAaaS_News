0,"Islamabad DC, SSP, SHO convicted in contempt of court case","Judge awards officials jail term, imposes fine; allows them to appeal sentence.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday convicted Deputy Commissioner (DC) Irfan Nawaz Memon, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Malik Jameel Zafar and Station House Officer (SHO) Margalla police station for contempt of court and sentenced them to six, four and two months imprisonment, respectively.
The court, however, enabled them to file appeals by suspending their sentence for a month. The contemnors on the other hand filed the appeals the same day.
IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri is likely to hear the appeals on Monday.
The IHC single member bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar convicted the officials for repeatedly issuing and executing successive detention orders issued against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Shehryar Afridi.
The court observed that “between May 9, 2023 and Nov 2, 2023, DC Irfan Memon issued some 69 detention orders in exercise of power under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO)”.

Judge awards officials jail term, imposes fine; allows them to appeal sentence

The judge noted that “cumulative period of detention that he ordered against those on the receiving end exceeded 1,000 days. Over two dozen petitions were filed before Islamabad High Court (IHC) challenging these orders. These cases were marked before seven out of the eight judges comprising IHC. Except for two cases, where detention orders were issued out of concern for sectarian violence, not one order detaining political workers on grounds of incitement of violence sustained judicial scrutiny.”
Justice Sattar found that “the manner in which the authority was exercised by the district magistrate in the instant matter was colorable and completely devoid of any rational basis aimed at achieving the objects of MPO i.e. to maintain public order or public safety”. 
He further said that “in view of the record that was produced before the court, it is evident that the conduct of district magistrate/deputy commissioner constitutes a fraud on the statute and the Constitution and amounts to exercise of statutory authority in a manner that can be characterized as malice in law”.
The court also found that the impugned detention orders are ultra vires the Constitution and have been passed in breach of provisions of MPO and are coram non judice and without jurisdiction.
According to the order, the district magistrate is facing contempt of court proceedings for obstruction of justice and in order to uphold his right to fair trial and due process, it is essential for this court not to form a firm opinion with regard to his conduct and what inspired such conduct.
Justice Sattar stated that the court adopted due process for the trial of the contemnors and were also given ample opportunities of defence.
“While this court took judicial notice of the material brought on record by state authorities during the hearing of Shehryar Afridi, it also summoned the record keepers of public offices to once again produce the relevant record before the court,” the order stated.
As per the charge sheet, DC Memon “issued an order in exercise of powers under section 3(1) of the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 (MPO) ordering the detention of Mr. Shehryar Afridi on August 8, 2023 on the basis that he was inciting general public through the content of his statements and was planning attacks on district courts and other public buildings in Islamabad.”
“In essence, what the executive authorities, prima facie, are trying to achieve is to curtail, at any cost, the liberty of the petitioner through preventive detention and that too in an arbitrary manner,” the charge sheet stated.
In the case in hand, the Islamabad police arrested the petitioner (Shehryar Afridi) but instead of investigating him in criminal cases, requested the district magistrate to detain him in preventive custody. The exercise of power and jurisdiction is arbitrary on part of the police officials and mechanical and without applying judicious mind on part of the district magistrate, ICT, the charge sheet said.
The detention orders issued by the district magistrate under the MPO against the petitioners was a result of arbitrary exercise of jurisdiction, excessive use of lawful authority and issued without applying judicious mind, it added.
The court accused the deputy commissioner of attempting to “obstruct the process of the court and disobeyed the order of the court”.
Subsequently, the judge held that DC Memon, “is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with six months simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine”. Likewise, “SSP Malik Jameel Zafar is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with four months simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine while SHO Nasir Manzoor is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with two months of simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine,” the court announced.
The IHC ruled that all these officials “will serve their sentence at Adiala Jail”.
The judge, however, observed that since they have a right to appeal this verdict before a divisional bench of this court within 30 days pursuant to section 19 of the Ordinance and the sentence awarded constitutes a short sentence and the convicted respondents being public servants do not pose a flight risk, the sentence shall stay suspended for a period of 30 days to enable the respondents to avail their remedy of appeal.
The court was of the view that though these contemnors could continue their respective offices, it asked the government to find their replacements.
The verdict says: “In suspending this sentence, this court has also taken into account the fact that respondent nos. 1, 2 and 4 occupy public offices and their sudden removal therefrom could adversely affect public convenience. The suspension of this sentence would enable the government to respond to this verdict without causing inconvenience to the citizens.”

The office of the chief commissioner has decided to challenge the judgement of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in which the DC was sentenced to six months imprisonment for disobeying court orders. The spokesman said the DC had used his legitimate powers as per the law to maintain public order.
“DC Memon will remain in his post till intra-court appeal is decided by the court. The decision to pursue intra-court appeal reflects a commitment to ensure due process and uphold the rights of all parties involved,” the spokesperson said.
The office of the chief commissioner will continue to cooperate with the legal process and remain steadfast in the pursuit of justice and adherence to the principles of good governance, he added. A public relations officer for the police said the officers will file an intra-court appeal against the verdict. The SSP operations was sentenced to four and the SHO to two months’ imprisonment. He also said the police officers had exercised their legitimate powers to maintain public order.
Meanwhile, the deputy commissioner filed an intra-court appeal against the single bench sentence.
The appeal stated that in May 2023, the DC received information from the SSP (operations) on the basis of which a detention order under section 3(i) of the MPO was issued by him to prevent breach of peace/unlawful assembly in the district. The detention was impugned before the IHC in a writ petition.
On June 2, 2023, the single judge of the high court declared the detention order unlawful. Thereafter, multiple detention orders were passed by the district administration of Rawalpindi. However, the appellant had nothing to do with that.

4,Ministry seeks progress report on Margalla Avenue-M1 link road,"Acquisition of land yet not started which is prerequisite to commence work, says CDA official","ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Interior has sought a progress report from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) on the proposed road to link Margalla Avenue with Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway (M1).
Sources told Dawn that through an official letter dated February 26, CDA had been directed to share the updated progress on the project with the ministry. They said the government wanted to get the road constructed as soon as possible.
The portion of the road will ultimately be linked with the Rawalpindi Ring Road. The letter said, “Keeping in mind the original alignment of Margalla Highway, part of Ring Road falling in Islamabad capital territory shall be acquired and developed by the CDA from its own resources. This will be connected with Rawalpindi Ring Road leading to MI eventually. CDA will acquire right of way for the road in Zone-2 for development and beyond the right of way the area will be fenced to make it controlled access.” 
Out of the total 3.4 km road portion, 1.8 km falls in Rawalpindi while 1.6 km falls in Islamabad which will be constructed by the CDA. 

Acquisition of land yet not started which is prerequisite to commence work, says CDA official

When contacted, an official of the CDA said after approving PC-I, the CDA had prequalified nine of a total of 21 construction firms for the project. However, he said, the acquisition of land had not yet been started, which was a prerequisite for starting the construction work. Another official, however, said the CDA was working to start land acquisition soon. 
The project worth Rs5.45 billion (construction and land acquisition) was approved by the civic body in August last year and once started work on it would be completed in eight months. 
According to a working paper of the CDA, the maximum benefit from Margalla Avenue cannot be achieved until the road was linked to M-1. The project comprises a six-lane road facility and aims at providing an alternative route for commuters travelling to Islamabad from G.T. Road (N-5) and vice versa.
In June, the federal government had given the go-ahead to the National Highway Authority (NHA) to construct the road in the limits of Rawalpindi.
In 2021, the then prime minister, Imran Khan, had directed the CDA to develop the road that fell within the limits of Islamabad whereas the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) was asked to carry out work on the portion that fell in their jurisdiction. However, the PDM government tasked the NHA to construct the road falling in Rawalpindi.
The Margalla Avenue, which starts at E-11 and culminates at GT Road in Sangjani, will be linked with the new portion of the five-km-long road. 
However, on the right side of the portion of the road constructed from E-11 to GT Road from E-11, work on fencing is yet to be completed. Moreover, many built-up structures are also present on the right of way of the road. 
“After providing proper access to locals, the remaining area of the road should be properly fenced to restrict movement of wildlife and avoid accidents,” said an official. 
He said Margalla Road was the principal road and its right of way was 600 feet but the CDA was yet to decide on the built-up structures falling in the heart of the alignment of the road.

9,"Ministry report claims schoolchildren lack proficiency in mathematics, science","Besides pointing out the low proficiency of students in mathematics and sciences, the report recommended reforms to improve the learning levels of students.","ISLAMABAD: A new official report, Pakistan’s National Achievement Test (NAT), which was released on Friday, highlighted the low proficiency of students in grades 4 and 8 in mathematics and science subjects.
The report was released here in Islamabad by the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE), a subsidiary of the Ministry of Federal Education. Besides pointing out the low proficiency of students in mathematics and sciences, the report recommended reforms to improve the learning levels of students.
According to a press release issued by PIE, despite widespread satisfaction among parents and students with the learning environment, the NAT results underscore critical areas for improvement to enhance student learning outcomes.
The press release said that the NAT assessment, which sampled 1283 public sector schools and over 23,000 students nationwide, revealed alarming trends in math proficiency levels among students at Grade 4 and Grade 8 levels.
Only 8 percent of Grade 8 students and 17 percent of Grade 4 students scored 75 percent or more in math assessments, highlighting a significant gap in math proficiency across primary and middle grades.
Speaking on the occasion, the chief guest of the launching ceremony, Federal Secretary Education Waseem Ajmal Chaudhry, said: “The report reveals a teacher shortage, highlighting the need to increase teacher capacity and adopt modern training methods.”.
Mr Chaudhry further said that it was also concerning that the majority of eighth-grade teachers have not received training in math and science in the past two years. “To improve the quality of education, we need to encourage interactive learning methods in classrooms and find ways to increase parental involvement in their children’s education,” he said.
Special Secretary Education Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani said that issues have come to the fore in the NAT: “We have the data, and now action is needed. To ensure quality education, we have to focus on basic education. We should determine a model school in any part of the country, then the measures and policies taken in it should be implemented in all educational institutions,” he said.
Director General PIE Dr Shahid Soroya said: “We must address the identified challenges through concerted efforts, including focusing on teacher training programmes, addressing teacher shortages, and improving mathematics and science education.”
The press release said: “Teachers, who play a pivotal role in shaping students’ academic success, scored the lowest in math assessments, achieving 74% and 71% proficiency levels in Grade 4 and Grade 8, respectively.” It said that a vast majority of Grade 8 teachers had not received any training related to mathematics and science in the last two years.
“More than 75% of parents with children enrolled in Grade 4 and Grade 8 expressed satisfaction with the school’s performance and the student’s environment. Approximately 90% of students enrolled in these grades also reported liking the school’s environment. However, these positive perceptions sharply contrast with the low academic achievement levels,” read the press release.
It said that at the Grade 4 level, students could only achieve a 49% score in mathematics, 56% in English, and 68% in Urdu/Sindhi. Similarly, student performance at the Grade 8 level remained below 51% in mathematics and science.
Vice Chancellor Allama Iqbal Open University Professor Dr. Nasir Mehmood, Senior Education Advisor from Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) Saima Anwer, Assistant Professor Dr Jessica Albrent from LUMS, Maliha Hyder and Toby Linden from the World Bank, and Georgina Glasby from Cambridge International Assessment also spoke at the report launch to share their recommendations and analysis.
