NEWLY-minted NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq congratulates Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah.—White Star

 
• Ayaz Sadiq, Ghulam Mustafa elected speaker, deputy speaker, respectively, amid boycott by JUI-F, Mengal
• Top ‘coalition’ leaders leave immediately after voting
• PTI links cooperation with return of ‘80 stolen seats’, release of ‘political prisoners’
• Achakzai seeks end to establishment’s role in politics
• Lower house of parliament to elect new PM tomorrow
ISLAMABAD: The newly-constituted Nat­io­nal Assembly on Friday elected the nominees of the eight-party alliance, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq of the PML-N and Ghulam Mustafa Shah of the PPP, as its new custodians, as PTI-backed lawmakers continued their noisy protest during eight-hour-long proceedings, which saw some hard-hitting speeches from both sides of the aisle.  
Members of the JUI-F and Sardar Akhtar Mengal of the BNP boycotted the election process and did not attend the entire sitting.  
On a number of occasions, the house witnessed ruckus due to loud sloganeering from both sides against the others’ leadership and at one point, PML-N’s Rana Tanveer was seen angrily rushing towards the opposition benches to physically attack the protesting PTI members, but he was prevented from doing so by his colleagues.  
Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, a soft-spoken businessman from Lahore who earned some across-the-board respect for his speakership from 2013 to 2018, bagged 199 votes, defeating PTI’s Amir Dogar, who polled 91 votes. PPP’s Ghulam Mustafa Shah secured 197 votes, while his opponent Junaid Akbar of the PTI got 92 votes.   
Both Mr Sadiq and Mr Shah were the joint candidates of the PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, PML-Q, PML-Z, IPP, NP and BAP alliance.  
The PTI members, who have now joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to lay a claim to the reserved seats for women and minorities, raised slogans and even gathered in front of the speaker’s dais when PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, PM-desi­gnate Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz cast their votes. IPP’s Aleem Khan also remained the target of the protesting PTI lawmakers, who raised slogans of ‘lota’ (turncoat) when he came to vote twice.  
There were slogans of “vote chor” and “mandate chor” every time the speakers took the names of members of the Sharif family. In response, some of the PML-N members, mostly women, also chanted slogans against Imran Khan and his sister Aleema Khan, calling them “thieves”.  
After polling his vote in the speaker’s election, Shehbaz Sharif sat for some time on the seat of the leader of the house in the front row. However, when the PTI lawmakers intensified their protest, PML-N’s Attaullah Tarar whispered something in his ear, prompting the PM-in-waiting to leave the house.  
PTI’s vocal member Jamshed Dasti, while casting his vote, made a brief speech and put one of his hands on the head of outgoing speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf, asking him to swear to God and answer “is this house legitimate?”  
Syed Khursheed Shah of the PPP showed a goodwill gesture by going to all the PTI members sitting in the front row for a handshake with Barrister Gohar, Omer Ayub, Asad Qaiser, Sher Afzal Marwat and others.  
All the PTI members first chanted slogans in favour of jailed founder Imran Khan and then polled their votes. Latif Khosa even made a brief speech without a mic before polling his vote and alleged that those who had called the sitting of the “incomplete assembly” had murdered democracy.  
Unlike opening day on Thursday, the PTI members showed a soft corner for the PPP as they remained silent when Asif Ali Zardari and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari came to cast their votes.  
It was perhaps due to the noisy protest that the top leadership of the PPP and the PML-N preferred to leave the house immediately after casting their votes.  
Earlier in the day, two more members — Gustasap Khan of the PTI and Muneeba Iqbal of the PML-N — took oath as MNAs, taking the total number of lawmakers in the lower house of parliament to 304.  
Of the total 304 members, 291 cast their votes in the election for the speaker and deputy speaker as 13 members were absent. One vote was rejected. Among those who did not attend the session were eight members of the JUI-F and one member each of BNP, PML-N, PPP, MQM and National Party.  
In his maiden speech, the newly-elected speaker said both the government and the opposition were like “two wheels of a car” and urged them to work together for the betterment of the country.  
The losing PTI candidate Amir Dogar said that had the Feb 8 elections not been rigged, he would have got 225 votes. He said Mr Sadiq had got 199 votes of eight parties, whereas he had secured 91 votes from a “single largest party” in the assembly.  
He said that despite all pressures on the PTI, its candidates received the highest number of votes in the polls but the results were changed overnight. “If this drama was to be enacted, then why elections were conducted in which over Rs50 billion of the public money was spent.”  
Mr Dogar said the opposition was ready to cooperate with the government-in-waiting, but first almost 80 stolen seats of the PTI would have to be returned to the party, seats reserved for women should be given and all political prisoners should be released forthwith. He praised the PTI workers for contesting elections on various symbols allotted to them after the party was deprived of its iconic ‘bat’ symbol.  
On the other hand, PTI’s candidate for the deputy speaker Junaid Akbar, after losing the election, said that they didn’t accept this assembly, adding that “unless our leader is released, we will not back down”.  
“Don’t stay in this illusion, we are not here for any reconciliation or talks,” Mr Akbar dec­lared while calling the house “occupied assembly.”  
Achakzai’s speech
After formally taking his seat and before announcing the election of the deputy speaker, Mr Sadiq gave the floor to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai who blasted the “establishment” over its alleged role in the Feb 8 general elections.  
The PkMAP chief suggested that on the first day of the National Assembly, they should pass three to four resolutions, calling for an end to “the role of the establishment and security institutions in politics. Otherwise, we will thrash them with the power of the public”.  
Mr Achakzai also called for the passage of a resolution to honour those judges who had in the past refused to legitimise military takeovers and lost their jobs. He also suggested another resolution seeking severe punishment for those judges who had validated martial laws in the country and called for withdrawing all monetary benefits from them. He urged the “military establishment and intelligence agencies” to remain within their constitutional domain and asked the leadership of the three major parties to pledge that they would not seek any support from the establishment.  
Mr Achakzai, who had been a target of the severe criticism from Imran Khan in the past, constantly received applause from PTI members when he directly targeted the “establishment” and accused it of “playing” with the country’s constitution. He even received a standing ovation from all the PTI lawmakers when he called for the immediate release of Imran Khan.  
When Mr Achakzai finished his speech, PTI’s candidate for the prime minister’s office Omer Ayub was seen rushing towards him to felicitate and thank him over his supportive remarks.  
Though the PTI members in their speeches and media talks have been constantly protesting over their alleged “stolen mandate”, none of them has ever made a direct reference to the establishment like Mr Achakzai did.  
MQM’s Dr Farooq Sattar reminded the protesting PTI lawmakers that when they were in the government they used to take pride of being on the same page with the establishment.  
PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal stated that no person, party or institution could solve the country’s problems and called for the politics of collaboration. He said Imran Khan used to call for accountability and he was now crying when he was being made accountable.  
Mr Iqbal made it clear that they were ready to engage the opposition, but “we will not let anyone make this house hostage”. He vowed to run the assembly, come what may, if the PTI members were determined to disrupt its proceedings.  
Omer Ayub said that Mr Iqbal was himself a beneficiary of the rigged polls and should be “ashamed” of talking about democracy.  
PML-N’s Attaullah Tarar took the floor and asked the PTI to seek public apology over “winning the 2018 elections” with the support of the establishment, before criticising them. He also “condemned” Mr Achakzai for targeting “state institutions”.  
The National Assembly will now meet on Sunday for the election of the prime minister.

1,Senators spar over PTI letter linking loan with poll audit,"PTI leader claims IMF approached Imran first to seek ""guarantee""; issue of unassigned reserved seats reverberates in upper house.","• PTI leader claims IMF approached Imran first to seek ‘guarantee’
• Issue of unassigned reserved seats reverberates in upper house
ISLAMABAD: Sena­tors from two sides of the aisle on Friday sparred over PTI founding chairman Imran Khan’s letter to the IMF linking rele­a­se of next tranche of bailout package for Pak­i­stan with audit of rece­ntly held general elections.
Senator Saadia Abbasi of the PML-N while raising the issue in the house regretted the invitation to the global len­der to intervene in internal matters of Pakistan.
She said IMF was neither an investigation age­ncy nor had the role to impose its will in matters linked with Pakis­t­an’s sovereignty. She said Mr Khan’s role was one of the strongest opp­o­sition parties at present.
 
 

She said the opposition was a watchdog on government and a government-in-waiting, but domestic issues should be resolved domestica­lly, highlighting the need for all to join hands to protect country’s interests.
PTI Senator Humayun Mohmand made it clear that it was the IMF that had sought a meeting with Mr Khan in June 2023. He said the IMF board of governors had declared that it would offer bailout package “only after Mr Khan gave a guarantee”.
He said the PTI chairman had been told that the first tranche would be released to the PDM government, second to the caretaker government and the third to the government that will get people’s mandate in a free and fair election.
“We are just reminding them that the next tranche is to be given to those having mandate,” the senator said, while accusing the government of being formed by those who had stolen mandate.
He reminded PML-N Senator Abbasi that this was also the opinion of former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former PPP senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and PML-N leader Javed Latif. He praised the PML-N candidate from NA-66, Nisar Cheema, for admitting that defeat was better than a stolen mandate.
‘Foreign intervention’
PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui said an invitation to foreign institutions to intervene in inte­rnal affairs of Pakistan by those who say “subjugation unacceptable” was condemnable. He also informed the chair that he has already submitted an adjournment motion on the subject with the secretariat.
 
 

Mr Siddiqui said there should be no injustice with women in jails for their association with the PTI. However, he said, there were around 1,400 women behind bars, besi­des four PTI women — Dr Yasmeen Rashid, Aalia Hamza, Sanam Jawed and Aisha Bhutta.
He said he could not support the demand for rel­easing the four wo­men without legal pro­cess, just because they belonged to the PTI.
Reserved seats
PTI lawmaker Zees­han Khanzada criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not allocating reserved seats to Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which has been joined by PTI-backed independent candidates.
 
 

He drew the attention of senators, worrying over Mr Khan’s letter, to the one written by US lawmakers urging President Biden not to recognise the government in Pakistan without a thorough investigation into the allegations of election rigging.
Another PTI Senator, Saifullah Abro, emphasised that the election to the office of the prime minister should be held only after the National Assembly is complete, with allocation of reserved seats. He said except PML-N, every party was complaining that elections had been rigged.
Senator Waqar Mehdi of PPP said his party also had reservations over the election. However, he added, writing a letter to the IMF was enmity with Pakistan. He said complainants should approach the election tribunals.
Also referring to the letter sent to the IMF by the PTI founder, PPP lawmaker Nisar Khuhro said such moves would only weaken democracy. He warned that political parties must not take steps that amount to attempts to derail democracy.

2,"Amid call for reform, Supreme Judicial Council wraps up case against ex-judge Mazahar Naqvi",CJP Isa remarks SJC repeatedly invited Justice Naqvi to cross-examine witnesses in open proceedings but he never availed the opportunity.,"ISLAMABAD: As the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Friday concluded proceedings on a reference against retired Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, the petitioners in the  Afiya Shehrbano Zia case called for reform in the council’s procedure.
During proceedings on Friday, Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa pointed out that Justice Naqvi had written a letter to the council, saying he refused to appear before it.
CJP Isa remarked that the SJC had repeatedly invited the accused judge to cross-examine witnesses in open proceedings, but the latter never availed the opportunity for his defence.
On Thursday, a leading developer, Zahid Rafiq, had conceded before the SJC that he had arranged £5,000 for the daughter of Justice  Mazahar Naqvi.
 
 

Separately, explaining their reasons for seeking an inquiry into alleged misconduct by judges of the superior courts, even after their retirement, the petitioners reiterated that their complaint was part of a campaign for civilian supremacy, and against state excesses.
The petitioners said they believed the procedure of the SJC must be reformed and that accoun­tability is important for judicial independence,  but selectivity and singling out certain judges by the state through its proxies, using references and proceedings against them, is an abuse of power and process, not a form of impartial and unbiased accountability.
They said a reference was filed against former chief justice Saqib Nisar in 2018 under Article 209 of the Constitution for misconduct, breach of judges’ code of conduct and excesses that infringed on the principle of the separation of state powers.
That judicial reference was signed by 98 citizens, many of whom were prominent in the MRD and the lawyers’ movement for the restoration of independent judiciary.
“This was a prescient challenge by these citizens for judicial correctives, considering the confusion, coercion, unresolved powers and excesses that Pakistan’s senior judiciary has incrementally unleash­­ed and itself been subjected to, particularly in the post-Saqib Nisar era,” they said.

3,CM Gandapur demands judicial probe into May 9,Calls for free and fair trial of Imran Khan; gives seven-day deadline for withdrawal of ‘fabricated cases’ in KP,"PESHAWAR: In his fiery inaugural speech, the newly elected Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Ali Amin Gandapur, demanded a judicial inquiry into the May 9 riots.
“We have been constantly asking for it [judicial inquiry]. I call upon the Chief Justice Supreme Court of Pakistan [referring to Justice Qaez Faiz Isa] to form [a judicial commission] and see who are the beneficiaries [of May 9],” Mr Gandapur demanded soon after his election as the province’s chief executive.
Mr Gandapur, who began his speech by expressing his heartbreak over becoming chief minister as an independent candidate, stated, “I want to put on the record that the injustice against the party [referring to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf], our leader, workers, and leadership has no parallel anywhere in world history, let alone in the history of our country.”
He said that his leader, Imran Khan, was imprisoned over a fake FIR, and his fault was to talk about Pakistan, Kashmir, Pales­tinian Muslims, and Riyasat-i-Madina.
“I demand a free and fair trial for Imran Khan, and he should be released immediately,” he said.

Calls for free and fair trial of Imran Khan; gives seven-day deadline for withdrawal of ‘fabricated cases’ in KP

Mr Gandapur said that he wanted a system where no one, including himself, could take illegal action against anyone. He added that if people want security for their children, sisters, mothers, the elderly, and anyone from any religion, the system must be changed. At the same time, he gave a seven-day deadline for the cancellation of ‘cases without evidence’ in KP.
“I politely ask to withdraw the fabricated cases within a week. [I] give them an opportunity to rectify [themselves], but if you are not wailing to rectify [yourself], then prepare yourself for punishment,” Mr Gandapur warned, adding that on the day he was released from prison and reached home, FIRs were registered against him in nine districts over riots. He said he would surrender if there was any evidence against him.
Mr Gandapur asserted that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had failed to fulfil its constitutional obligations as international organisations, in their reports, said that the Feb 8 polls were not free and fair. He mentioned that they were not allowed to submit nomination papers, and the nomination papers of 80 per cent of their candidates were initially rejected but later accepted following court orders.
“Under the Constitution, the ECP has failed. I demand the chief election commissioner to resign and call on CJP [Justice Isa] to form an independent judicial commission to deliver justice,” Mr Gandapur said.
He urged for an open, free, and fair trial for the former prime minister Mr Khan. He emphasised that his leader’s only fault was revealing a conspiracy [referring to the cipher], stating that his leader had been fighting for the coming generations, and the struggle for ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ would persist.
He expressed frustration, noting that not only was his party denied a level playing field, but it wasn’t even offered ‘the field’ and was deprived of its election symbol. He said that he was ready for a probe on the basis of Form-45 into the allegations of rigging in Feb 8 polls in KP.
Discussing the challenges KP faces, the newly elected KP chief minister stated that his government’s top priority would be maintaining law and order and ensuring the protection of KP residents.
He extended an offer to the opposition benches to collaborate if they were willing. Additionally, he announced the reactivation of the Sehat Card from the first of Ramazan and pledged to establish a commission to address the issues faced by overseas Pakistanis.
He said revenue would be generated from within the province, providing relief to the underprivileged. He also emphasised the collection of revenue from what he referred to as the ‘mafia’ with tourism, mines, and minerals identified as potential sources of income.
Earlier, Mr Gandapur, who won from PK-113 Dera Ismail Khan, secured his position as the province’s 22nd chief minister with an overwhelming majority. He garnered 90 out of a total of 106 votes polled, defeating his rival, PML-N’s Dr Ibadullah, a joint candidate of the opposition parties, who received 16 votes. The JUI-F boycotted the voting.
Dr Ibadullah, the leader of the opposition, also spoke and condemned the harassment of women parliamentarians. He expressed the belief that if political leadership came together, they could find solutions to the problems.
He said the past should be forgotten, and they should move ahead for the development of the.
The session was later prorogued indefinitely.

4,Foreign Office dismisses US ‘directions’ on probing election rigging,"“We believe in our own sovereign right to make decisions about Pakistan’s internal affairs,” says FO spokesperson.","ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan has dismissed the United States’ suggestion to probe electoral discrepancies, emphasising that it will not succumb to external dictates.
In her weekly press bri­efing on Friday, Foreign Office spokes­person Mum­taz Zahra Baloch categorically stated that no country can give directions to Pakistan, which is an independent and sovereign country.
“We believe in our own sovereign right to make decisions about Pakistan’s internal affairs,” Ms Bal­och said while replying to the comments made by her US counterpart reg­arding allegations of misconduct in the elections held on February 8.
 
 

Earlier this week, US State Department spoke­sperson Matt­hew Miller said any claims of interference or fraud “should be fully and transparently investigated in accordance with Pakis­tan’s own laws and procedures”.
On another occasion, he said, “With respect to inv­estigations into reported irregularities, we want to see those investigations proceed … [and] wrapped up as soon as possible.”
The comments were prompted by accusations — particularly by PTI-backed candidates — of tampering with and manipulation of election results announced after an unprecedented delay by the Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The ECP and the caretaker government have strongly refuted the accusations, urging political parties to pursue legal remedies for their complaints through courts and other appropriate channels.
Mr Miller isn’t the only US official to express concerns over the polls. Around 35 Congress members, led by Democratic Party’s Gregorio Casar, have written a letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging not to acknowledge the new government in Islamabad formed after the election.
While replying to a question about the letter, Ms Baloch said, “This is a communication between public officials in the US and is not addressed to the government of Pakistan. We therefore have no comments to offer on such letters,” she added.
Ms Baloch said Pakistan is a “dynamic democracy” and possesses the necessary domestic frameworks to address any issues related to elections or democratic processes. The spokesperson also refrained from commenting on a letter written to the International Monetary Fund by PTI to link any future financial support with the audit of the election.
“As you know, the prime minister has made a statement on this matter. The Ministry of Finance takes the lead on IMF-related issues, so they will be in a better position to comment on this subject.”
On a question about the indictment of four Pakistani nationals in the US for supplying arms to Houthi rebels, the spokesperson said FO was in touch with the US Embassy in Islamabad and Pakistan’s Embassy in Washington to ascertain facts and provide consular access to the individuals following confirmation of their nationality.

5,Sharif camp optimistic after Nawaz woos Fazl for support,Rana Sanaullah says Maulana has no grudge against PML-N.,"ISLAMABAD: PML-N sup­reme leader Nawaz Sharif visited the residence of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman here on Friday, possibly to seek the latter’s support in the formation of the upcoming coalition government at the Centre, as the JUI-F had abs­tained during the voting for speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly.
Nawaz Sharif was accompanied by PML-N stalwarts Ishaq Dar, Rana Sanaullah, Ahsan Iqbal, Ayaz Sadiq and Khawaja Saad Rafique. The hosts included JUI-F Secre­tary General Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Haji Ghulam Ali, Aslam Ghori, Noor Alam Khan and Usman Badini.
 






Both parties maintained that the discussion was focused on the country’s political situation and the need to make collective efforts for discarding the feeling of depression and uncertainty among the masses.
The huddle took place a day after Rana Sanaullah held a meeting with the JUI-F chief and apparently fail­ed to persuade Maulana Fazl to extend his party’s support to the coalition government, led by the PML-N.
 







Rana Sanaullah says Maulana has no grudge against PML-N

Soon after the photo session, the leaders of both the parties came out of the room, allowing Mr Sharif and Maulana Fazl to hold one-on-one talks.
As they came out, Saad Rafique was asked by the media why they were not participating in the meeting. He responded that the Almighty would bring good news and declined to say anything about the future role of JUI-F in the federal cabinet.
 
 

However, Rana Sanaullah, who is PML-N Punjab president, told the media: “Nawaz Sharif and Maulana Fazlur Rehman had a good meeting to discuss wide-ranging national issues, as the country is passing through a very difficult period.”
Asked if the PML-N supremo was seeking the JUI-F vote for his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif for the post of prime minister, Mr Sanaullah said: “Nawaz Sharif did not come here with the intention of seeking votes from Maulana Fazlur Rehman.”
He added that the political situation facing the country was discussed and the reason for the one-on-one meeting was to reach some conclusion for the betterment of Pakistan. “Maulana sahib is our leader, we have faced tough times together and we have always been guided by him,” he added. “He [Maulana Fazl] has always been very kind to us, we will not let him go anywhere.”
Mr Sanaullah said the Maulana had informed Mr Sharif about his party’s position vis-à-vis the recent general elections.
“Maulana Fazlur Rehman has no grudge against us and our effort is that they will stay with us, we want his guidance,” he added.
After the PML-N delegation had departed, Maulana Ghafoor Haidari came out smiling, saying there has been progress in the meeting.
“When the two leaders came out of the one-on-one meeting, both looked happy,” he said. “But our position is firm, we will not be part of the government.”
He explained that the JUI-F had taken a major decision not to join the government and they do not have the authority to change it.
“Meeting of the party’s Sindh general council will be held on March 3, that of Punjab on March 7, and the central general council’s meeting will be held after Ramazan,” the JUI-F leader said, adding that a decision whether to join the government or not has to be ratified at the central general council meeting.
