0,Pakistan to attend crucial Afghan meeting in Doha,Durrani will lead the Pakistani delegation at the two-day meeting of the special envoys,"Pakistan would attend a crucial United Nations-sponsored conference being held in the Qatari capital next week to discuss roadmap for engagement with the Afghan Taliban government, according to an official statement issued by the Foreign Office on Friday.

Pakistan’s Special Representative on Afghanistan Ambassador Asif Durrani would lead the Pakistan delegation at the two-day meeting of the special envoys on Afghanistan in Doha from Feb 18 to 19, the statement added.
The conference – hosted by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres – is the second such moot in less than a year.

“The meeting is being convened … to discuss approaches for international engagement with Afghanistan in a more coherent and structured manner,” the statement read.

The statement said that Pakistan’s participation in the meeting was part of its efforts to actively engage with the international community, including the United Nations, to strengthen efforts for lasting peace and prosperity in Afghanistan.
Special envoys from the UN member states and international organisations would attend the conference, for which representatives from the Afghan civil society, women’s groups, and Taliban officials have also been invited.

The conference is a critical, high-level opportunity for donors and the region to chart next steps on how to improve the situation in Afghanistan and engage with the Taliban regime, according to the US Institute of Peace.

The conference will discuss the ongoing humanitarian and human rights crises and the recent report on a way forward by UN Special Coordinator for Afghanistan Feridun Sinirlioglu.

The Afghan Taliban government has also been invited to the conference but its participation is not certain yet.
The Taliban government wants to be treated as legitimate representatives of Afghanistan. Kabul also has reservations over the appointment of a UN special envoy on Afghanistan as recommended by a UN resolution passed a few weeks back.
Stephane Dujarric, the UN secretary-general’s spokesperson, said that the objective of the meeting is to discuss the international engagement approach with the Taliban since they reclaimed power.

“An important aspect of the event is the intention to provide the opportunity for the special envoys to meet collectively with Afghan stakeholders, including representatives of the de facto authorities and Afghan civil society participants, including women,” Dujarric told Voice of America.

A key agenda item for the conference is the potential appointment of a UN envoy who would coordinate increased international engagement with the Taliban leaders in Kabul.

The appointment, recommended in an independent UN assessment, is backed by the United States and its European allies.

China and Russia abstained from a Dec 2023 UN Security Council vote on a resolution authorising the secretary-general to appoint a special envoy for Afghanistan. However, the de facto Afghan authorities remain opposed to appointing the envoy.
The conference comes at a crucial juncture when the international consensus seems to be breaking. China last month accepted the Taliban-appointed ambassador in a move seen as being tantamount to recognising the Kabul regime. Beijing, however, has not yet clarified its stance.

The Pakistani side will advocate engagement with the Taliban government but link any recognition of the Kabul administration to fulfilling it international commitment, particularly denying terrorists a space to operate from their country.

2,Murad likely to be Sindh CM again,Faryal Talpur not interested in position," 
The PPP has not officially decided yet who the party’s next Sindh chief minister would be but sources told The Express Tribune that Syed Murad Ali Shah, who was holding this coveted position until the caretaker set-up took over for the general elections, was a strong candidate.

Earlier, rumours had surfaced that the main contenders were Faryal Talpur -- sister of party co-chairperson and former president Asif Ali Zardari; former provincial information minister Sharjeel Inam Memon; and ex-local government minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah.

However, the sources claimed that Faryal was not interested in the slot.

The sources disclosed that the PPP had finalised the name and  the party could announce it in the next couple of days.
They added that the top party leadership was satisfied with Murad’s performance.

With a clear majority in the provincial assembly, the PPP will easily bag the slot without forming any alliances.

Murad replaced Syed Qaim Ali Shah in July 2016 and remained one of the active chief ministers of Sindh.
He continued his second tenure after the general elections in 2018 till 2023, when the interim set-up took over for the polls.
In the recent elections, Murad secured victory from PS-77 Jamshoro-I against Roshan Ali of the Grand Democratic Alliance.

It is not for the first time that rumours of the remaining three candidates have surfaced.

Faryal has won from PS-10 Larkana-I by defeating JUI-P’s Kifayatullah in recent general elections. Memon emerged victorious from PS-61 Hyderabad-II competing against JUI-F’s Saeed Talpur. Nasir gained success in the race for PS-25 Sukkur-IV while JUI-P’s Amir Bux was the runner-up.

In the next Sindh Assembly session, which will be held after the final notifications of the successful candidates are issued, Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani will administer oath to the new members.

Durrani has recently said all was set for the next provincial assembly session.

3,"PTI, JI unite in protest against alleged election rigging","We have decided to meet all parties who raised their voice against this rigging, says Asad Qaiser","In a significant development, a delegation from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) met with leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, where both parties expressed their concerns over the alleged rigging in the recent general elections and announced a joint protest against the perceived irregularities.

PTI leader and former speaker of the National Assembly, Asad Qaiser, addressed the media after the meeting, stating that the two parties had a one-point agenda at this time – to protest against what they termed as ""rigged"" elections.
Qaiser emphasised that the level of rigging alleged in this election is unprecedented, prompting the need for collective action among parties that have raised their voices against it.

""We have decided to meet all the parties who raised their voice against this rigging. We will sit together and think about the next course of action. Decisions will not be made in closed rooms. At this time, the country is moving towards instability, and we will also fight a legal battle,"" said Qaiser.

He announced a nationwide protest scheduled for Saturday, urging people to participate in the peaceful demonstration. Qaiser emphasised the commitment to strengthening democracy and assured that the struggle against alleged rigging would continue.

JI leader Liaquat Baloch, speaking on the occasion, welcomed the PTI delegation and reiterated their stance against the election results, which they promptly rejected after the February 8 polls. Baloch also called for the resignation of the Chief Election Commissioner, emphasising that the new situation has become clearer after the PTI delegation's arrival.

""We have discussed all aspects, and it is the responsibility of political powers to ensure that Pakistan's elections are free from state interference. Jamaat-e-Islami has clarified its policy and strategy,"" said Baloch.

He further stated that the coordination between the two parties would continue, and they would bring other parties along that share concerns about the alleged election rigging. Baloch also highlighted the party's appeal to the Supreme Court for intervention.

4,'JUI-F not to become part of any govt',Maulana Abdul Wasay confirms party won't form government in Balochistan,"The JUI-F will not participate in the government, neither at the federal level nor in Balochistan, announced Maulana Abdul Wasay, the party’s Balochistan president, on Thursday.

“The JUI-F is not going to form a government in the province. The party has decided not to become part of any government,” stated Wasay.

In the February 8 general elections, JUI-F secured 10 seats in the provincial assembly of Balochistan. However, despite being part of the last coalition government, the party managed to secure only 4 seats in the National Assembly, much to the dismay of JUI-F chief, Fazlur Rehman.

On Wednesday, Fazl threw a political curveball by rejecting the ""rigged"" election results while extending an invitation to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif to join him on the opposition benches instead of pursuing government ambitions.

The JUI-F refused to accept the electoral outcome lying down. He announced the party would kickstart nationwide protests against alleged electoral manipulation by ""anti-Islamic forces.""

During a press conference, Fazl expressed reservations about the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) role, alleging it had been “dubious from day one.”

""Our central committee has rejected the election results and expressed reservations about the role of the ECP, but JUI-F will play its role in the parliament and will attend it with reservations,” he stated.

He accused the election process of being manipulated at the behest of “anti-Islamic forces” and emphasized the party's commitment to maintaining strong relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan. He noted that their efforts in this regard were not accepted by the United States and Israel.

On Thursday, the JUI-F chief claimed that he was against the idea of removing the PTI government from power through a vote of no confidence. However, he felt compelled to align with other political parties as he was leading the multi-party alliance, the PDM. Later that day, he also met with a PTI delegation.

5,Imran urges US tough stance on ‘poll rigging’,Ex-PM expects stronger US voice regarding PTI's election exclusion,"PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan on Thursday demanded that the US should adopt a tough stance on “rigging” the recent general elections in Pakistan.

After meeting Imran in Adiala Jail, PTI leader Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, accompanied by former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, told the media that the former premier had pushed the US to take a tougher stance on the recent general polls.

He further quoted Imran as saying that the manner in which the PTI was ousted from the polls, the US should be more vocal.

Barrister Saif said the PTI founding chairman was of the opinion that the US had supported the governments of dictators and corrupt people, but now it was presented with an opportunity to raise its voice on Pakistan’s election “rigging”.
The statement came a day after the US Department of State had said it is appropriate for the Pakistani state to investigate the allegations of rigging in the general elections.

|To a query, State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the United States had called for those allegations to be investigated.
""We think that’s an appropriate step to take. That's our response to questions of irregularities not just in Pakistan, but when we see them anywhere in the world. We think that they're thoroughly investigated and resolved. And so that – we will continue to call for that.

""But at the same time, it's clear that the elections in Pakistan were competitive, and we look forward to working with the government, once it’s formed, that the people of Pakistan elected,"" he maintained.

To another query, Miller has called the efforts to form a coalition government in Pakistan “ultimately an internal matter”.
""You see this in a number of countries that have parliamentary system of government where no party has established a majority; you see the kind of coalition that is formed, ultimately that is not the decision for the US to make, it’s the decision for Pakistan to make,"" the department’s spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, speaking on the occasion, Qaiser, who won the election for NA-19 Swabi-I as a PTI-backed independent candidate, said they would not resign under any circumstances and sit in the assemblies. “We have expressed our concerns and will also protest, but sit in the assemblies as well,” he added.

The former NA speaker further said the US, which considered itself a champion of democracy, was silent on this matter.
He continued that the US’ ‘cosmetic’ statement on the elections in Pakistan was unacceptable.

Qaiser also demanded that the US should take a stricter stand against those who had “rigged” the recent polls.

6,Gandapur to convene parliamentary party soon,Says he will give confidence to institutions and gain their trust,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-nominated candidate for Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief ministership Ali Amin Gandapur said on Thursday he would take decision in consultation with the party’s newly-elected parliamentary party, which would be convened very soon.

According to Express News, Gandapur departed from his home town of Dera Ismail Khan to Peshawar, where he is scheduled to meet the newly-elected PTI-backed independent members of the K-P Assembly to chalk out the future strategy.

“I am in touch with all the [elected] members of the assembly. I will call a meeting of the parliamentary party in Peshawar,” he said. “We will make policies with mutual consultations, restart health cards and work to end poverty,” he added.
Gandapur – who won the February 8 elections on both the national and the provincial assembly seats from Dera Ismail Khan – emphasised that as the K-P chief minister he would give confidence to the institutions and gain their trust.

Meanwhile, the PTI on Thursday barred its independent members in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa from joining the Jamaat-e-Islami to form a coalition government in the province, a day after the latter refused to enter into an alliance with the former.
Sources said the PTI-backed members in K-P were likely to form a provincial government in their independent capacity.
The JI refused to join hands with the PTI as it had decided that it would a form coalition with the latter in the Centre instead of limiting its alliance to just a provincial level.

JI Central Deputy Amir Liaquat Baloch had confirmed ongoing discussions with the PTI, revealing that the Imran-led party had signalled a willingness to collaborate for government formation.

However, on Wednesday, JI spokesperson Qaiser Sharif said his party's ""cooperation with the PTI at the national level will be for national interest” but the latter had now changed its position.

The PTI sources said the JI’s conditions were surprising.

7,ECP snubs Nawaz’s plea against NA-15 results,Commission tells PML-N supremo’s lawyer to file application again,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday dismissed PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s application for stopping the notification of the results of NA-15 Mansehra – a constituency where he lost to PTI-backed independent candidate Shahzada Gustasap Khan.

A two-member bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, was hearing the complaints of candidates who had challenged the election results.

Nawaz’s lawyer did not appear before the bench and the NA-15 Mansehra returning officer (RO) while submitting his report to the commission said the constituency’s result had been compiled as per Form 45.

The ECP bench rejected the PML-N supremo’s application to stop the notification of the successful candidate, directing his lawyer to file it again.

As the ROs submitted their reports on the NA-56 and NA-57, the bench declared the applications of independent candidates Shehryar Riaz and Samaya Tahir admissible. In NA-56 Rawalpindi-V and NA-57 Rawalpindi-IV, PML-N’s Hanif Abbasi and Danyal Chaudhry had defeated Riaz and Tahir, respectively.

The ECP bench summoned the successful candidates in the two National Assembly constituencies and their ROs in person for the next hearing.

The ECP informed the IHC that it had withdrawn the notification regarding the victory of Aun Chaudhry from NA-128 (Lahore) in the general elections.

The bench also reserved its decision on the applications filed by PTI-backed independent candidate Basharat Raja for NA-55 Rawalpindi-IV and party president Chaudhry Pervez Elahi for PP-32 Gujrat-VI. Basharat and Elahi were defeated by PML-N’s Ibrar Ahmed and PML-Q’s Chaudhry Salik Hussain, respectively.

The CEC said the ECP did not make decisions on the basis of media reports and those implicating allegations of rigging or tampering of results must also present evidence.

The bench, while issuing a notice to NA-234 Karachi RO, adjourned the hearing of the matter till February 21.

On the request of Qaisra Elahi, the wife of the PTI president, the hearing for NA-64 Gujrat-III was adjourned till Friday (today).

The hearing on the applications related to Lahore constituencies NA-126 and NA-127 was adjourned till next week.
Separately, voting on Thursday concluded peacefully at 26 polling stations of NA-88 (Khushab-II) in Punjab, two of PS-18 (Ghotki-I) in Sindh, and 25 of PK-90 (Kohat-I) in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

PPP’s Shehryar Khan Shar is competing against JUI-F’s Nasir Mehmood and independent candidate Jam Mehtab Hussain Dhar for PS-18 (Ghotki-I).

PTI-backed independent candidate Aftab Alam Afridi is in the race for PK-90 (Kohat-I) against PPP’s Amjad Khan Afridi and JUI-F’s Muhammad Shoaib.
