0,Contrary to OPEC view : IEA trims 2024 oil demand forecast,IEA predicts oil demand will peak by 2030 as world shifts to cleaner energy,"Global oil demand growth is losing momentum, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday as it trimmed its 2024 growth forecast, in sharp contrast to the view held by producer group OPEC.
The IEA, which represents industrialised countries, has predicted that oil demand will peak by 2030 as the world shifts to cleaner energy. OPEC, meanwhile, expects oil use to keep rising for the next two decades.
Monthly reports this week from the two forecasters underlined their starkly different estimates for 2024 oil demand.

The IEA’s monthly report on Thursday said it expects global oil demand to grow by 1.22 million bpd this year, slightly down from last month’s estimate. OPEC on Tuesday stuck to its much steeper growth forecast at 2.25 million bpd. In the IEA’s view, the deceleration this year, about half of the growth in 2023, is linked to a slowdown in Chinese consumption. The IEA had previously forecast 2024 demand growth of 1.24 million bpd.
“The expansive post-pandemic growth phase in global oil demand has largely run its course,” the IEA said, adding that a harsher global macroeconomic climate is also likely to constrain growth this year.
The Brent oil benchmark has risen about 6% so far this year as attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have raised supply fears.

1,"KCCI, PTA call for action on tea import anomalies","Say tax exemption misuse, unfair duties threaten tea industry’s viability","The Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) and the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA) have demanded that the government put an end to the misuse of tax exemptions and address other anomalies in tea imports.
KCCI, Senior Vice President, Altaf A Ghaffar urged the Federal Board of Revenue, in a statement released on Thursday, to take notice of the widespread misuse of tax exemptions in Azad Kashmir and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas/Provincially Administered Tribal Areas. This misuse has led to a substantial loss of revenue and is pushing commercial importers of black tea, a major revenue source, out of business, he said.
Ghaffar highlighted that commercial imports of black tea face exorbitant taxes and duties totalling 53%, while importers from Azad Kashmir and FATA/PATA regions pay only 15% to 19%. This imbalance has resulted in about 75% of black tea imports being diverted to exempted areas, far exceeding their actual consumption. Most of this tea is sold throughout Pakistan, depriving the FBR of significant revenue.
He also noted that importers of black tea pay taxes and duties of Rs6.21 million per container, whereas those in Azad Kashmir and FATA/PATA pay Rs1.65 million. This significant disparity unfairly burdens non-exempt importers across Pakistan, resulting in additional costs of Rs4.56 million extra per 20-foot container of black tea. Ghaffar stressed that legitimate importers of black tea have seen a sharp decline in business over the past few years due to these practices.

He added that black tea, imported by Azad Kashmir and FATA/PATA regions with tax exemptions, was intended solely for sale within these areas. However, it’s being widely distributed nationwide, severely impacting the revenue of black tea importers, who generate Rs3.5 billion annually.
In addressing the issues faced by tea importers, KCCI’s Senior VP demanded that the tax exemptions granted be discontinued by the end of the current fiscal year, with no further extensions granted after June 2024. This move would provide a level playing field, he said.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Khalil Paracha, Senior Vice Chairman of the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA), stressed the need to halt the misuse of exempted duties and eliminate the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) duty imposed on tea imports. Paracha highlighted the anomaly of charging MRP duty at the finished product stage, while tea is imported in bulk. He expressed concerns on behalf of the entire industry, including importers, traders, and packers, calling for the removal of the MRP duty at all relevant forums, including the ministry, federation, and association.

2,Steps proposed to achieve 5% annual agri-growth,Agricultural body hopes new govt will address challenges in budget,"Pakistan needs a consistent annual growth of around 5% in the agriculture sector to feed its population and there are high hopes that the incoming government will tackle the challenges being faced by farmers in the federal budget, said FPCCI Central Standing Committee on Agriculture Convener Ahmad Jawad.
Talking to media on Thursday, Jawad stressed that to meet the challenges of achieving national food security and economic prosperity, a two-pronged approach was required. This included vertical growth by increasing per-acre yield of crops and horizontal growth by bringing more area under cultivation through corporate farming.
“Pakistan has the potential to plant crops over 22 million acres by combining both vertical and horizontal approaches,” he said.
At present, the per-acre yield in the country is far less than the global average due to limited access to modern machinery and digital support services for farmers.
“In this regard, artificial intelligence (AI) can revolutionise and revitalise the agriculture sector, especially horticulture, while addressing the challenges of climate change, adapting to crop patterns and attracting talent,” he added.

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FPCCI) agricultural committee chief underscored the urgency of embracing AI as the most significant step in the agriculture sector, which should also feature in the Green Pakistan Initiative.
“Our policymakers often spend excessive time in meetings, discussions and visualisations, which delays the adoption of pragmatic approaches.”
Jawad pointed out that both developed and developing countries were moving towards digital revolution, recognising data as today’s equivalent of gold.
“AI can help analyse historical data, weather trends and storage conditions to predict optimal harvest times and storage duration for crops.”
The FPCCI believes that instead of viewing the agriculture sector as simply a provider of food for the poor, Pakistan must see it as an engine of economic growth for the next few decades. “But this can only be achieved if we are able to shun some of the most common and ill-advised perceptions about the sector,” he added.

3,IT ministry fails to win cabinet’s nod,Seeks approval of implementation mechanism for digital infrastructure initiative,"The federal cabinet has refused to accord its approval to the implementation mechanism established for the Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative to protect cyberspace and mitigate the risks associated with cyber-attacks.
The project is being launched with an allocation of Rs5 billion out of information and communication technology (ICT) research and development (R&D) funds as bridge financing.
This is a one-off exemption granted for spending money out of the ICT R&D funds.
The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication recently tabled a plan to approve the Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative and its implementation mechanism.
However, a cabinet member argued that the IT ministry should not bring issues pertaining to procurement before the cabinet. Therefore, the cabinet approved the initiative but stayed away from giving its nod for the implementation mechanism.
The cabinet was told that in the coming years, the digital economy would be the main pillar of economic growth, which required a reliable ICT infrastructure.
It was noted that every economy in the world was striving to protect its cyberspace and mitigate the risks associated with cyber-attacks. The cabinet was apprised that the existing ICT infrastructure provided avenues for unscrupulous elements to misuse and unethically access data through unauthorised means.
Therefore, there was a dire need to safeguard the cyberspace and establish an effective mechanism to counter cyber-attacks on the critical information infrastructure.
Clause 11 of the Telecommunication Policy 2015 clearly states that Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) shall deploy a solution under a framework ensuring long-term sustainability through constant updates and upgrades to keep pace with ever-changing technological trends and capacity requirements.
On the directives of the prime minister to set out implementation modalities for the initiative, the IT ministry has held several rounds of consultations with all the parties concerned, including the Ministry of Finance.
It was agreed that the IT ministry should coordinate with the finance ministry with PTA and others acting as implementing agencies. It was noted that a steering committee of the stakeholders concerned was proposed to oversee progress on the initiative.
A cabinet member observed that procurement matters should be dealt with by the IT ministry and those should not be brought before the cabinet.

The meeting was told that the related matter of funding had been separately considered by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), which approved a one-time allocation of ICT R&D funds amounting to Rs5 billion as bridge financing for the initiative, a decision ratified by the federal cabinet.
The IT ministry requested the federal cabinet to grant approval to the Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative, critical for securing the cyberspace along with the implementation mechanism.
The cabinet observed that approval could be given only to the initiative and not its implementation mechanism, which fell within the mandate of the IT ministry.
The cabinet considered a summary titled “Approval of the Digital Information Infrastructure Initiative”, submitted by the Information Technology and Telecommunication Division, and approved only the proposal for the digital infrastructure initiative.
An international cybersecurity and digital privacy company reported in mid-January that 15% of companies globally had experienced cyber incidents due to insufficient cybersecurity investment.
It is alarming that critical infrastructure, oil, gas and energy organisations have suffered the biggest number of cyber incidents.
According to a study conducted by Kaspersky, 15% of companies across the world encountered cyber incidents owing to the dearth of investment in that critical area over the last two years.
When it came to companies’ finances, one in five admitted they did not have the budget for adequate cybersecurity measures.
Kaspersky undertook the study to discover opinions of IT security professionals working for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other companies worldwide regarding the human impact on cybersecurity in a company.
The telecommunications sector suffered 13% of cyber incidents due to budget constraints, while transport and logistics, and financial services’ companies each saw 8% of incidents.

4,Rupee slips to Rs279.38/$ on political uncertainty,"Moody’s warning, dwindling reserves exacerbate markets","Following low-intensity volatility in the open market, the Pakistani currency inched down to Rs279.38 against the US dollar in the interbank market due to ambiguity over political and economic fronts.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, the domestic currency depreciated by 0.02% or Rs0.06 on a day-to-day basis, closing at Rs279.38 against the greenback.
The renewed depreciation in the currency is recorded following Moody’s Investors Service anticipated very high uncertainty regarding Pakistan securing the much-required next International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme amid heightened political uncertainty, as the ongoing $3 billion loan programme concludes in April 2024.
Any delay in the acquisition of the next programme will impact the rupee directly, as the country is due to repay significant foreign debt amidst low foreign exchange reserves, standing at $8 billion at present.

Read Rupee disparity grows amid political turmoil
The currency resumed its downturn in the major market following a cumulative loss of Rs0.58 in the past four consecutive working days due to concerns over a reduction in the supply of foreign currency in the open market.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported the currency ticked down by Rs0.01 to Rs281.60/$ in the open market.
Therefore, the disparity in the value of the rupee between the interbank and open market slightly reduced to Rs2.22 (0.79%) compared to Rs2.27 (0.81%) a day ago. The spread stood at around Rs1.50 some days ago. The gap, however, remained significantly low compared to the IMF recommended limit of 1.25% (around Rs4 at current levels).
In the interbank market, the rupee had recovered almost 10% or around Rs28 in the past five months until the early days of this week.

5,LSM output hits 21-month high,3.43% growth pushes QIM to 132.87 in Dec 2023 compared to 128.37 in Dec 2022,"Pakistan’s large-scale manufacturing (LSM) industries reached a 21-month high output, with strong support coming from agriculture, petroleum products, wearing apparel, and pharmaceutical sectors in December 2023, hinting at a gradual turnaround in economic activities in the current fiscal year 2023-24.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Thursday that LSM output increased by 3.43%, pushing the quantum index of manufacturing (QIM) to 132.87 in December 2023 compared to 128.37 in the same month of the last year. LSM production grew by 15.69% in December compared to the prior month of November 2023.
Cumulatively, in the first half (Jul-Dec) of FY24, the large-scale manufacturing industries’ growth contrasted 0.39% compared to the same period of the last year.
According to PBS, production in July-December 2023-24 increased in food, beverages, wearing apparel, coke and petroleum products, chemicals, fertilisers, pharmaceuticals, non-metallic mineral products, machinery and equipment, and other manufacturing (football). On the other hand, output decreased in tobacco, textile, iron and steel products, electrical equipment, automobiles, other transport equipment, and furniture during the period under review.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Arif Habib Limited’s Head of Research, Tahir Abbas, attributed the improvement in LSM output to the government’s strategy to gradually reopen the domestic economy. Earlier, the government had taken harsh measures to cool down the overheated economy, which contracted LSM growth.
To recall, the authorities concerned had jacked up interest rates and controlled imports to manage the then critically low foreign exchange reserves and control multi-decade high inflation reading spiked to 38% in May 2023. State Bank of Pakistan Governor, Jameel Ahmed, said late in January 2024, the volume of imports had increased by $700-800 million in recent months compared to less than $4 billion/ month many months ago, suggesting a gradual reopening of imports in the wake of the improvement in foreign exchange reserves to then a six-month high at $8.3 billion.
Abbas estimated the first-half contraction at 0.39% to turnaround at a positive growth in the range of 2-2.5% in FY24 full-year. He said the food (agriculture) sector would continue to lend its outstanding support to the LSM sector with bumper wheat and sugar crops in the year. Besides, the textile sector – which has posted a contraction of over 2% in the first six months of FY24 – is expected to extend its support to LSM in the second half (Jan-Jun) on expected improvement in its exports, he said.

Along with this, the production from other industries, including wearing apparel, coke and petroleum products, fertilisers, and pharmaceuticals, is also expected to remain supportive towards the betterment in LSM output in FY24 full year. AHL expert Abbas said the industries would manage to give a better output ahead as the central bank expected to cut its benchmark policy rate cumulatively by 3-4 percentage points in the ongoing second half of FY24, providing relatively affordable financing to pick up production and economic growth.
The policy rate (interest rate) standing at a record high at 22% since late June 2023, has hit industrial activities hard, resulting in slightly contrasting economic growth in FY23.
While commenting on the LSM sector in its latest monthly economic outlook of January 2024, the finance ministry said that in Jul-Dec FY2024, the performance of the auto-industry remained subdued due to a massive increase in input prices and tightened auto finance. Car production and sale decreased by 56.9% and 55.5%, respectively, while trucks and buses production and sale decreased by 56.9% and 49.6%. However, tractor production and sale increased by 67.5% and 103.3%
The sale of petroleum products slumped by 15% during Jul-Dec FY2024 to 7.68 million tonnes against 9.03 million tonnes in the same period last year. During Jul-Dec FY2024, total cement sales (domestic and exports) were 23.87 million tonnes, 9.7% higher than 21.76 million tonnes dispatched during the corresponding period last year.
Credit to the private sector
Credit to the private sector improved to a four-month high at Rs8.54 trillion in December 2023, supporting growth trends in the industrial sectors and the overall economy.
The loans to the private sector grew by 3.4% in December compared to November 2023.
Abbas said some industries have continued to borrow expensive financing to run their day-to-day production cycles.
On a year-on-year basis, credit, however, dropped 1.4% to Rs8.54 trillion in December compared to Rs8.66 trillion in the same month of the last year.

6,SIFC measures yielding positive results: PM,"Says reforms, policies have contributed to making conducive business environment","Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar stated on Thursday that measures implemented under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) are yielding positive results, as the caretaker government endeavours to revive the national economy.
“The caretaker government has taken steps to create a conducive business environment and provide facilities to the private sector to contribute to the country’s development and increase tax revenue,” he said.
Kakar made these remarks during a meeting with a delegation from the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP) and industrialists of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, led by Senator Nauman Wazir, at the Prime Minister’s Office in Islamabad.
Also present at the meeting were State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmed, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman, and secretaries of the relevant ministries, according to a statement from the PM office.
The PM highlighted that through its policies, the government is facilitating the private sector to boost exports and employment opportunities. He expressed hope that the next elected government would continue providing employment opportunities and ensure overall economic progress by further enhancing industrial development and investment in the country.

Kakar commended the efforts of the caretaker finance minister, the FBR chairman, and all concerned quarters for bringing reforms in the FBR aimed at prudent economic policies. He also praised the business community and investors for their support during difficult times, highlighting their role in restoring investors’ confidence in government policies. Regarding FBR reforms and the establishment of SIFC, PM Kakar emphasised that it is an opportune time to invest in diverse fields. He urged companies associated with the steel industry to prioritise investment for the development of new iron ore deposits in the country.
During the meeting, participants lauded the caretaker government’s efforts in facilitating investment, resolving industrialists’ problems, reforming the FBR, and taking measures to restore the economy.
The meeting provided detailed information on Pakistan’s large-scale steel and copper industries, the fourth-largest export sector, with copper exports alone totalling $1.35 billion in the last financial year. It was highlighted that annual per capita steel consumption in Pakistan is 40 kilograms, indicating significant potential for sectoral development. Additionally, the annual tax revenue from the steel industry amounts to Rs400 billion.

With the addition of commercial banks’ foreign currency reserves, Pakistan’s total liquid reserves stood at $13,149.1 million. Of these, the commercial banks held net reserves of $5,092.6 million. Earlier, Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar announced that the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves would reach $9.1 billion following the receipt of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan tranche of $700 million in mid-January. It is pertinent to note that such high reserves had last been seen in July 2022.
Notably, any delay in the acquisition of the next programme will impact the rupee directly, as the country is due to repay significant foreign debt amidst low foreign exchange reserves, standing at $8 billion at present.

8,Traders urge govt to withdraw gas price hike,Say utilities are not exploited in developed states for economic gains,"Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI) President Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani has hit out at the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) for its decision to make a massive increase of 65% in gas tariffs.
He appealed to all political leaders and the country’s rulers to withdraw the gas price hike promptly to restore confidence of the business community and encourage collaborative efforts for stabilising the national economy. He urged them to reconsider the decision, pointing out that in developed countries, utilities were not exploited for economic gains.
He asserted that the government’s focus should be on providing essential facilities to foster industrial growth, rather than jacking up gas and electricity tariffs without proper planning. He deemed it disastrous for industries and questioned the moral justification of the caretaker government, especially after February 2024 elections.
He said the additional burden of Rs242 billion imposed on consumers was solely aimed at complying with IMF’s conditions, resulting in an adverse impact on businesses and the public.

Read ECC approves increase in gas prices
The revised gas prices, reaching Rs100 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for the protected consumers, Rs300 per mmBtu for non-protected consumers and Rs900 per mmBtu for bulk consumers, are seen as detrimental to the already struggling industries in the country.
He said 80% of factories in Hyderabad’s renowned glass bangle industry had already been closed due to high tariffs and gas outages, which left thousands unemployed.
With the latest 65% increase, Shaikhani feared that the remaining factories would also be shut down, adding to the number of jobless people in the Hyderabad region.
He slammed the caretaker government’s plan to meet IMF’s conditions, stating that it would result in the closure of industries, worker layoffs, rise in street crimes and bankruptcy of manufacturing units, all of which would negatively impact the economy.

9,Market watch : Stocks slump over changing political scenario,"KSE-100 index plummets 1,133.78 points, settles at 61,020.06","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday slid nearly 2% to around 61,000 points as the race among different political parties intensified for forming a new government, sparking worries among investors who refrained from building new positions.
In the morning, the trading session commenced on a dull note as selling pressure weighed on investor sentiment because of political uncertainty post-elections.
The bourse remained bearish throughout the day, touching the intra-day low at 60,926.85 points about an hour before the close of trading.
Furthermore, fears about the Economic Coordination Committee’s (ECC) decision on a further increase in gas prices kept investors at bay. The market continued to fall steeply, losing over 1,100 points at close.
“Stocks fell across the board amid political noise as new coalitions emerged for the PM’s slot,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Default risks amid political instability, policy uncertainty and ECC’s approval of an increase in gas prices for industrial and residential consumers to recover an additional Rs242 billion played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a drop of 1,133.78 points, or 1.82%, and settled at 61,020.06.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, declared the day as “a bolt from the blue”.
Pakistan equities began business on a positive note but the benchmark index started to come off sharply after news arrived that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was also engaging in talks with different parties to form the new government, it said. “This development knocked down the market’s positive momentum with a feather.”
Exploration and production (E&P), power, bank and fertiliser sectors contributed negatively to the index as Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Hub Power, United Bank and Engro Corporation lost 438 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that the KSE-100 turned negative as political temperatures rose. “Volatility is very high as news headlines dominate,” it said.

“February is again proving to be a weak seasonal period for the KSE-100,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal stated that the KSE-100 index experienced selling pressure throughout the day owing to the re-emergence of political uncertainty. “Broad-based selling was observed,” he said.
“Going forward, we recommend investors to view any downtrend as an opportunity to buy stocks in banking and fertiliser sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 345.1 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 303.9 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs11.9 billion.
