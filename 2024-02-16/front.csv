0,PML-N awakening to its empty victory,Leader admits party may not complete five-year term if forms a government,"As initial excitement for forming a coalition government recedes, a serious realization of the credibility of the very elections that the PML-N is a beneficiary of has started to dawn upon the party, especially after the reaction of its former ally, Maulana Fazlur Rehman led JUI-F.

Talking to The Express Tribune, a second-generation PML-N leader said almost all parties have raised questions about the credibility of the elections, which means the election process has zero legitimacy.

“How can any government formed as a consequence of such a visibly tainted exercise survive? [PML-N President] Shehbaz Sharif completed his term as the prime minister earlier, but this time around things are different,” he said.

Talking with reference to the seats that the party lost, he questioned whether the party’s loss in the elections was organic or someone deliberately engineered a hung parliament to steal their mandate.

""We couldn't take a definitive position on this now, particularly after the party decided to pursue forming a government."" He said the party needed to introspect if it even wanted to form a government.

He said as the dust of the elections settles, the fate of the incoming government will be more visible, but as of now, it appeared that the PML-N will not be able to complete its term.

The PML-N is the only party that came out in support of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and accepted the election outcome, while all the while raising questions of its own about the elections process in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), where the PTI won a landslide victory.

When asked if the party will reconsider its position on the polls at some stage, the leader said if the JUI-F chief continued his charge against these elections, then the PML-N will also have to modify its position.

Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday rejected the Feb 8 election results while announcing a country-wide protest movement against alleged rigging.

When asked if Nawaz Sharif's decision not to become prime minister for the fourth time was solely motivated by the election outcomes, he said there were various external factors taken into account before making such a decision.
He accepted that Nawaz's decision disappointed many within the party for different reasons.

As far as the public reaction was concerned, the PML-N’s entire election campaign was based on Nawaz becoming the premier, so when he decided to nominate Shehbaz for the position, people felt betrayed and sad, he said.

When asked if people within the PML-N felt there were internal factors or a conspiracy against Nawaz Sharif that influenced his decision, he gave a cryptic reply, stating that ""they have indeed betrayed Nawaz Sharif.""

Another senior PML-N leader said things were not as hunky-dory as they seemed. He, however, refused any further comments.

1,"Amid vote fraud, SC to take up plea seeking poll anew",Former army officer’s petition set for open court hearing on Feb 19,"As the uproar from various political parties over allegations of election rigging takes over the political landscape, the Supreme Court is set to address a constitutional petition filed by a former military officer on February 19 (Monday).
In the petition, Brig (retd) Ali Khan seeks a declaration that the February 8 elections were rigged, urging for a fresh round of general elections.
He has lodged a three-page constitution petition under Article 184 (3) of the constitution, which is currently awaiting formal numbering. The Supreme Court Registrar's office, however, has raised objections regarding the petition's maintainability.
Pursuant to the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act of 2023, every constitutional petition undergoes review by a three-judge committee to determine the case's fixation and the composition of the bench.
Typically, a SC judge hears appeals in chambers against objections raised by the Registrar's office on the maintainability of a petition.
However, this particular case has been scheduled for an open court hearing, where the three-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali, will decide whether to assign a number to the petition or not.
Interestingly, the same bench declared on January 13 that PTI's intra-party elections were illegal, leading to the party losing its election symbol. Despite these setbacks and complaints of an uneven playing field, PTI managed to surprise its opponents by securing a majority of seats in the National Assembly.
Meanwhile, several PTI candidates continue to voice grievances, asserting that their election victories, initially confirmed by Form 45 issued by presiding officers, were later altered through the issuance of Form 47 by Returning Officers (ROs).
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is currently examining these cases.
It is pertinent to note that a perceived harmonious relationship prevails among state institutions, including the executive, the ECP, and the judiciary, under CJP Qazi Faez Isa.
Read PTI leaders share election ‘irregularities’ with president
These institutions also enjoy support from esteemed legal bodies like the Pakistan Bar Council and the Supreme Court Bar Association.
Against this backdrop, the scheduling of the constitutional petition holds considerable importance. The bench may scrutinise the petitioner's legal standing, questioning the locus standi.
Despite considering itself the primary victim of purported election rigging, the PTI has not sought redressal from the Supreme Court thus far
Senior lawyers opine that the judges must exercise additional caution during the hearing, as any remarks made could potentially bias the cases of PTI candidates currently under consideration in the ECP.
The ongoing discussion also revolves around the potential repercussions if the bench dismisses the petition on election rigging.
Every remark from the bench is anticipated to carry significance during the hearing. There is an expectation that the apex court will refrain from taking any action that might validate the entire election process.
According to Article 225 of the Constitution, election disputes can exclusively be addressed by tribunals. However, this process is time-consuming. Furthermore, with the current accusation of widespread rigging, the tribunals will only address individual cases.
The crucial factor determining the legacy of the current CJP, Qazi Faez Isa, lies in the conduct of free and fair elections. While he played a role in ensuring the elections, questions have arisen regarding the fairness of the process.
The superior judiciary has been on trial since the Panama case, with lingering doubts about political leaders receiving convictions during periods of strained relationships with powerful circles.
This pattern was evident in the Panama case, where the Sharif family faced legal challenges since 2017.
Leading up to the 2024 elections, Imran Khan and his party faced challenges in seeking relief from the superior courts. Now, a debate has emerged regarding whether the judiciary will provide them with relief after the announcement of election results.

2,PPP sticks to party line on cabinet posts,Party wants office of president for Zardari instead,"Following the latest round of inter-party discussions between the PML-N and PPP, it has become evident that the latter is not inclined towards participating in the forthcoming federal cabinet.

The uncertainty surrounding PPP's involvement emerged after Asif Ali Zardari, co-chairperson of PPP, hinted at the formation of a government by all parties, merely hours after his son and party chairman, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, rejected any ministerial roles but expressed a desire for the presidency for his father.

Although PPP delegates continue to endorse Bilawal's position, they have confirmed the party's lack of enthusiasm for cabinet positions. While talks initially revolved around key constitutional offices such as the presidency, Senate chairpersonship, and National Assembly speaker, they have since expanded to address broader, high-stakes issues.

However, specifics of these discussions remain confidential, as all participants have pledged not to disclose core matters deliberated during the meetings.

In line with this stance, a PPP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, reaffirmed the party’s disinterest in joining the cabinet, emphasizing that it is not even on the current agenda.

Despite this clarity, official statements issued after the meetings appear somewhat misleading, as they emphasize discussions on national issues such as inflation, unemployment, and poverty reduction, along with the formation of a stable government to address the country's challenges.

Regarding these statements, the PPP leader wryly remarked that the media should expect such releases to continue.
After the first round of talks, a statement read that both the parties had agreed that there was a need for a stable democratic government to deal with the challenges of economy, politics, security and terrorism.

Following the meeting on Thursday, an official statement from PPP read that Bilawal was briefed by the members of the party’s contact and coordination committee about the multilateral consultations among the political parties at Zardari House in Islamabad.

The members of the body included Qamar Zaman Kaira, Syed Murad Ali Shah, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Shuja Khan, Saeed Ghani, Nadeem Afzal Chan, and Bahadur Khan Sehar.
Earlier, the PPP committee had contacted the PML-N and a consultative meeting was then held between the bodies of the two parties.

“Proposals were discussed regarding inflation, unemployment and relief from poverty in the country,” read the statement.
The representatives of the PML-N from other provinces also participated in the second round of talks. Both sides said the matters would also be put forth before other like-minded political parties after which they would be finalised.
Just a week after the general elections, the much-desired political stability still seems to be a distant dream because of the split mandate.

Amid allegations that the polls were rigged, different political parties are busy contemplating what strategy should they adopt to move ahead.

On the one hand, the PML-N is striving to form the government in the Centre and Punjab with the support of the PPP, MQM-P and other smaller parties. On the other, the PTI, which contested the polls with independent candidates and bagged more seats than the PML-N, is busy persuading JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to launch a protest campaign against alleged polls rigging.

Another twist came on Tuesday when both the contenders for the premier’s position -- PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal -- opted out of the race.

The PML-N then nominated for the slot its president and Nawaz’s younger brother Shehbaz Sharif, who is busy persuading his previous allies to help him become the premier again.

The JUI-F chief refused to support the PML-N and even asked it to sit on the opposition benches. Now all eyes are on the PML-N and PPP committees and leaderships to see if the two parties stay together or not.

3,"Imran challenges Toshakhana, cipher verdicts",Qureshi also moves high court against his conviction in diplomatic cable case,"PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and the party’s vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday challenged their respective sentences in the Toshakhana (gift repository) and cipher cases.
Imran, a former premier, and his wife Bushra Bibi’s lead lawyer, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, filed two appeals, writ petitions, and applications before the Islamabad High Court, challenging the orders passed by an accountability court in the Toshakhana reference filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the special judge adjudicating matters related to Official Secrets Act in the cipher case.
Imran and his wife were sentenced to 14 years in jail in the Toshakhana reference. The special court awarded the former premier and Qureshi 10 years’ imprisonment in the cipher case during their jail trial.
Barrister Zafar contended that the ex-premier and his wife had been erroneously convicted and sentenced by the accountability court.
The PTI founding chairman’s appeal in the Toshakhana reference read that the available evidence on record fails to establish any connection between the appellant and the alleged violation of Section 9 of the NAO 1999.
It continued that the judgment had been passed without a fair trial and due process. “Being in violation of Article 10A, the [verdict] was null and void and liable to be set aside,” it read.
It contended that the court had throughout the proceedings acted in undue haste as if the case had to be decided before the date of general elections to be held on February 8 this year.
Read Imran, wife indicted in Toshakhana case
It further read that the court illegally did not allow the appellant and his lawyers to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses.
“It is well-established that cases under the Ordinance necessitate the prosecution to substantiate allegations before drawing presumptions or inferences against the accused. In the present case, there is an absence of evidence indicating appropriation or misappropriation of any property with a dishonest and fraudulent intent to gain wrongfully. Without such proof, no offense under Section 9(a)(iii) can be deemed to have been established. The appellant, in compliance with all codal formalities, received the gifts from Toshakhana in accordance with the law.”
In the other appeal filed in connection with the cipher case, it read that the appellant had been erroneously convicted by the special court.
It contended that his conviction and sentence required immediate setting aside as they resulted from misreading and non-reading of evidence and a blatant disregard of his fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution along with “serious departure” from the settled principles and procedure as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958.
It added that the Supreme Court had underscored the importance of the right of an accused to engage the services of counsel of his own choice to prepare a sound defence. However, it continued that the trial court “condemned a hasty approach of appointing counsel mid-trial and requiring them to argue immediately, particularly in a case involving capital punishment.”
“The Official Secrets Act, 1923 does not stipulate any provisions outlining a timeline for the conclusion of trials. However, the learned trial court has misinterpreted the law for reasons known only to the court and has rushed through the trial, depriving the appellant of a fair criminal trial,” it read.
In related development, Qureshi also filed an appeal in the IHC against his conviction in the cipher case.
The petitioner, in the plea filed through Ali Bokhari Advocate, Barrister Taimoor Malik and Salman Safdar Advocate, pleaded before the IHC that his 10-year jail sentence handed down by the special court on January 30 this year should be terminated.
He also asked the court to suspend his sentence till the final verdict in the appeal.

4,JUI-F chief admits ‘gaffe’ about ex-ISI DG,Fazl says he ‘mistakenly’ named Lt Gen (retd) Faiz when talking about no-trust move,"JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Friday “clarified” his earlier statement about former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed’s role in the no-trust motion against the then Premier and PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, saying that he had “mistakenly” mentioned his name.
A day earlier while speaking to a private TV news channel, Fazl accused former army chief Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz of orchestrating the downfall of the PTI government led by Imran in April 2022.
Elaborating on the events of the no-confidence vote through which the country saw for the first time in its history the ouster of a prime minister, the JUI-F chief claimed that the former army chief and ex-spymaster were in touch with all the opposition political parties in connection with the no-trust motion and they guided them about it.
“I was opposed to the idea of tabling a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan,” Fazl claimed. “(Lt) Gen (retd) Faiz had come to me and he asked me to go ahead [with the no-confidence vote], but only within the system, not out of it. Though I refused it,” he claimed.
The JUI-F explained that he changed his stance once representatives from various parties approached him for joint action. “If I had refused it again, they would say I am saving Imran.”

Fazl was among the top opposition leaders, who spearheaded the efforts to oust the PTI founding chairman under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).
However, Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum replaced Lt Gen (retd) Faiz as the ISI DG in Oct 2021. Lt Gen (retd) Faiz was posted as the Peshawar corps commander when the PTI government was removed from power.
After a PML-N leader pointed out this mistake at a news conference earlier in the day, the JUI-F chief swiftly acknowledged his “error” but maintained his stance on Gen (retd) Bajwa and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz’s alleged involvement in rigging the 2018 elections.
In another interview with a private TV news channel, Fazl insisted that this matter should be consigned to history instead of being discussed more.
He said he had disclosed everything and that was enough.
“We wanted to remove the PTI government through a no-confidence motion. The PDM, PPP, and ANP used to have daily meetings. Gen (retd) Bajwa had held many meetings with me alone.”
Also read: 'JUI-F not to become part of any govt'
Talking about the recently held elections and meeting with the PTI delegation, Fazl said that transparent elections did not take place anywhere in the country, including Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
""Despite our differences, the PTI delegation came and held a positive meeting. We agreed [with them] that rigging did take place in K-P.”
He further said he would not give priority to personal grudges over national goals.
""Differences are there [with the PTI] but they are not personal rather at party level.”

5,"PTI won’t leave PM, CMs posts uncontested","Picts Omar Ayub for PM’s slot; Aslam Iqbal and Salar Khan for Punjab, Balochistan CMs","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Thursday nominated party’s acting Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan for the post of prime minister, Mian Aslam Iqbal for Punjab chief minister, Salar Khan for Balschistan Chief Minister and Aqib Ullah Khan for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly speaker.

Acting PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told the media that Khan had nominated these candidates, and added that nominations for the posts of national and provincial speakers and deputy speakers would be made soon.

“We will explore all available options to elect Omar Ayub Khan as the prime minister,” Barrister Gohar said, after a meeting with the party’s founding chairman Imran Khan in the Adiala Jail. “He [Omar Ayub] will lead the country till the time Imran Khan is released from the jail.”

Moreover, In a significant development, the PTI and the once arch-rival Jamiat JUI-F voiced a singular stance on Thursday, denouncing the recently held February 8 general elections as ""not free and fair"".

During a joint press conference, prominent figures from both parties echoed mutual concerns regarding the lack of transparency and prevalence of rigging and irregularities in the electoral process.

Hafiz Hamdullah, representing JUI-F, emphasised the consensus reached between the two parties, highlighting the widespread agreement on the “compromised” nature of the polls.

PTI's Barrister Saif concurred, affirming that both PTI and JUI-F have unequivocally rejected the election outcomes. However, he added that PTI would persist in its political endeavours, aiming to collaborate with other like-minded parties who share their stance on the unfairness of the electoral process.

In the worst case scenario, if the party was not allowed to form the government at the Centre, Gohar added, the PTI would prefer to sit on the opposition benches rather than sharing power either with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) or the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).

“We were offered to share power with the PML-N and the PPP but we refused to accept the offers as per the principled stance of Imran Khan. The nation has given a clear mandate to Tehreek-e-Insaf for forming government in the country. Our mandate is being snatched by manipulating election results.”

Barrister Gohar stressed that the PTI would persevere until decisions on its pending election-related appeals in courts.  He appealed to the courts to promptly make decisions on more than 70 petitions related to manipulation in the results of the February 8 elections.

Barrister Gohar complained that the party, which he claimed had bagged more than two-thirds majority at the centre, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) was being marginalised, saying that attempts were being made to steal PTI’s mandate and give to those who could not even secure 20 seats.

He announced that the PTI, as per Imran Khan’s decision, would start nationwide protest demonstrations on Saturday (tomorrow) against the “blatant rigging” in the last week’s general election in the country.

He asked all political parties – Jamaat-e-Islam (JI), Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), Awami National Party (ANP) and others, who believed that their mandate had been stolen – to join the protest movement for democracy, rule of law and real freedom in the country.

He appealed to the masses to come out in large numbers to register their protest against vote tampering. “The elections were the most difficult polls in the country’s history in which the Pakistani nation has given a clear mandate to Tehreek-e-Insaf against all odds,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Senior PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat disclosed that the party had considered long march plans but Imran Khan decided that the people had to come out to protect their mandate. Imran had asked the nation to come out in large numbers on Saturday (tomorrow), he added.

“They [the government] will try to harass you. They may try to stage a false-flag operation like May 9. They may attack you through police and law-enforcement agencies. But you should keep in mind that it is for the future of Pakistan,” Marwat said.

“If you fail to show up in big numbers such attempts to steal public mandate will continue in future elections,” he warned. He added that Khan had already said that efforts were afoot to impose a money-laundering syndicate in Pakistan, but this plan was bound to fail.

Citing Imran, Marwat stressed that only remittances from overseas Pakistanis could bring the country out of the current economic quagmire. He added that Imran Khan had underscored that financial stability would be impossible without political stability in the country.

Marwat announced that the party would give a detailed presentation to the national and international media about the manipulation of the February 8 election results on Friday (today). “It will show Form 45 of all 80 constituencies in which election results were tempered with.”

Meanwhile, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser termed the elections as the worst in Pakistan’s history and stressed the need for concerted action against electoral malpractice. He said that the PTI would reach out to other parties to launch a country-wide protest movement.

Despite challenges, the PTI remains steadfast in its refusal to accept electoral irregularities, opting instead to pursue legal avenues and mobilise public support. Plans for a parliamentary party meeting are under way, underscoring PTI’s commitment to challenging the election results, he concluded.

6,"Homes hit, businesses reel as energy rates jacked up",Residential gas prices up 67%; subsidy to fertiliser plants goes; POL process rise up to Rs8.37,"The government on Thursday increased gas tariff for residential users by up to 67% and up to 700% hike for fertiliser plants, while jacked up the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs8.37 per liter from Friday (today), in a move aimed at addressing the economic dynamics and ensuring stability in the energy sector.

The federal cabinet, in a meeting chaired by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, approved the gas price hike to recover additional Rs242 billion from all the consumers, in attempts to bring some equity in the rates of the fast depleting natural asset.

Immediately after the cabinet meeting, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) issued notification of the new gas prices, in accordance with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) condition of raising the prices by Thursday, February 15.
Just before Thursday midnight, Finance Division notified that the price of MS (petrol) had been increased by Rs2.73 per litre, from Rs272.89 to Rs275.62. Similarly, the price of high speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs8.37 per litre, from Rs278.96 per liter to Rs287.33.

The Finance Division said that the decision came in line with the recommendations of Ogra. It added that the adjustment aimed at addressing the current economic dynamics and ensuring the stability of the energy sector in the country.
It was the second time in the past three months that the gas tariff has been increased. The Ogra notification, showed that the hike would take effect from the February 1, and the new bills would be issued with revised rates. The decision puts an unreasonable burden on a class of residential consumers using more than 2 cubic hectometers (Hm3) gas for creating fiscal space to pay subsidies to other domestic consumers.

The cabinet also finally took the much-delayed but needed decision to withdraw the Rs50 billion subsidies to a few fertilisers plants, which were earlier given preferential treatment by robbing the industrial consumers.

Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar played a pivotal role in the withdrawal of the fertiliser plants’ subsidy, although the energy minister was in favour of continuing these subsidies. The fertiliser plants were availing these subsidies without passing on the benefit to the farmers.

The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet held two rounds to approve these prices and finally took the decision on Wednesday. The federal cabinet ratified the ECC decision of February 14th, reads a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office after the cabinet meeting.

It is the third increase in the prices that the consumer would bear amid double-digit inflation. The increase has thrown an additional burden of Rs242 billion on the consumers, including Rs37 billion that the government would earn in sales tax.
It was also the second revision in the gas prices by the caretaker government in the past three months after it earlier increased the prices up to 1108% – the highest for the most vulnerable households.

Residential consumers

The fresh revision also puts maximum burden on the most vulnerable households with a 67% or Rs100 increase per unit for the domestic monthly consumption of 0.5 cubic hectometers (Hm3). For other protected domestic consumers, the increase is in the range of Rs200 to Rs250 – also ranging from 25% to 67%.

The prices for non-protected residential consumers are either now close to the prescribed price of Rs1,597 per mmbtu or even higher than the prices of imported re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG). The rates for 1.5 Hm3 consumers have been increased to Rs1,450 – higher by 21%.

The new prices for the 2 Hm3 monthly consumption consumers are Rs1,900 – up by 19% - and Rs300 more than the cost of gas they need to pay. Similarly for the next slab of 3 Hms consumption, the new rate is Rs3,300 – close to the imported gas rate of Rs3,750.

The two highest residential slabs are charged rates that are even higher than the imported gas prices –Rs3,800 and Rs4,300. They are now forced to pay for the subsidies of other domestic consumers, which is unjustifiable.

Earlier this month, OGRA issued a determination of revised estimated revenue requirements (RERR) for FY 2023-24 for both the SNGPL and the SSGCL. According to the revised determination, the SNGPL requires a revenue of Rs592 billion and the SSGCL requires a revenue of Rs310 billion this fiscal year, the total revenue requirement has been determined at Rs902 billion, arriving at an average prescribed price of Rs1,596 per mmbtu.

The residential consumers of housing societies that buy gas in bulk will face a 45% increase in their prices. Their new rate is Rs2,900 – up by Rs900 compared to current rates that too are just three months old.

The fresh increase in prices is expected to further fuel the inflation that remains far higher than the goal set by the central bank. The inflation rate in January remained at 28.4% as against the annual target of 21%.

Industrial Consumers

The cabinet approved further increase in the gas prices for the in-house power generation of the industries for both the export and non-export sectors. Going forward, the cabinet has ended the distinction of the export and non-export and a new uniformed rate for in-house gas plants has been set.

The cabinet approved increase in the captive plants rates from Rs2,200 to 2,750 for exporters and from Rs2,500 to 2,750 for local production – an increase, ranging from 10% to 25%. The Petroleum Division had proposed Rs2,950 per mmbtu rate, which was opposed by the industry minister.

The Pakistan Textile Exporters Association (PTEA) Pattern-in-Chief Khurram Mukhtar emphasised the need for negotiating sustainable energy tariffs with the IMF and rationalising cross subsidies on industrial energy tariffs to support growth.

“Just raising energy tariffs is not going to work; strict enforcement requires reducing T&D losses and full bills recovery,” said Mukhtar. “Current hike in gas and electricity tariffs is disastrous for the economy and lacks any wisdom,” he added.

Fertiliser plants

The caretaker cabinet has taken some corrective measures to stop the misuse of subsidy by the fertiliser plants. These plants were availing subsidised gas but were still selling expensive urea to the farmers.

The cabinet approved increase in the feed gas prices for Engro Fertiliser from Rs200 to Rs1,597 per mmbtu –a surge of 700% that ends Rs39 billion subsidies. The effective date for revised gas tariff for Engro Fertiliser is 1st March, 2024.
It also approved increase in gas prices for Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBQL) from Rs580 to Rs1,597 mmbtu, showing an increase of 175% and ending its Rs10 billion subsidy.

Agritech and Fatima Fertiliser are currently getting RLNG from SNGPL network. The cabinet approved increasing their prices by 29% to Rs1,597 per mmbtu, which is the average prescribed price in case these plants are offered system gas on SNGPL.

The government still has to increase the gas prices for those fertiliser plants, which are availing the gas from the Mari Gas network.

For the CNG sector, the government has increased the prices from Rs3,600 per mmbtu to Rs3,750 per mmbtu equivalent to the RLNG price being the fuel for majority CNG producers in the country.

7,Imran says PTI will not exact political revenge,Ex-PM says PTI to adopt ‘Fatah-e-Makkah’ approach for political stability in the country,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan on Friday stressed the need for forgiveness, saying that his party would not exact political revenge from anyone rather it would move ahead for the development of the country.
Senior party leader Ali Muhammad Khan said in a social media post after meeting Imran at the Adiala Jail that the PTI founder underscored the importance of forming a truth and reconciliation commission in order to take the country forward.

“After coming to power, we will not take any political revenge, but we will take the country and the nation forward for the sake of development of the country and the nation,” Ali Muhammad Khan quoted Imran as saying.

He added that Imran also referred to former South African leader Nelson Mandela's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

8,PTI decries ‘historic electoral heist’,Former ruling party claims 85 NA seats were 'snatched away’,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Friday dialled up its attacks against tampering with its purported mandate, alleging that a whopping 85 National Assembly seats, which it had secured in the Feb 8 polls, were surreptitiously ""snatched away"".
The party deemed the alleged electoral manipulation as the ""largest assault on democracy"" in the nation's political history while accusing the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of orchestrating a nefarious conspiracy to strip the newly elected PTI MNAs of their public mandate on ""ridiculous technical grounds"".
In its declaration after the important meeting of the core meeting, the PTI pointed out that even other major political parties, not just the PTI, were vocalising concerns about the chief election commissioner and the ECP’s alleged criminal role.
It alleged that with the blessings of the ECP, blatant disregard for the people's mandate, Constitution, and democracy took place.
The party also announced plans for ""peaceful protests"" across the nation, slamming the door on rumours of cozying up with the PPP in the big leagues and the PTI-P in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to form a coalition government.
Addressing reporters following a meeting with Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) leaders in Islamabad, PTI leader Asad Qaiser extended an invitation to other political parties who believe there was ""rigging"" in the elections to join the protest.
Qaiser emphasised, ""The meeting had a singular focus: the nation's mandate was pilfered in the 2024 elections,"" underscoring the collective agreement to raise a unified voice against the ""bold rigging.""
The PTI's core committee has urged the public to step out of their homes in response.
In the post-executive committee meeting declaration, the PTI asserted that the people would not tolerate the ""insult of their mandate by the ECP"", vowing not to forgive those who were involved in undermining the Constitution and democracy.

PTI 'won 179 seats'
Separately, the party, addressing the media in Islamabad, claimed that the total number of seats on which PTI-backed independents emerged victorious was 179, and the number of rejected votes cast in favour of the party outnumbered victory votes cast in favour.
PTI Information Secretary Raoof Hasan, Sher Afzal Marwat, Rehana Dar and Salman Akram Raja among other leaders, who challenged their election results before various forums, were present at the news conference.
Elaborating on the claims further, Hasan said that the party possesses data for 46 seats, while the data for the remaining seats would be completed within the next 24 hours.
PTI leader Shandana Gulzar said that the party bagged 1.25 million votes from Karachi, and despite contesting from so many constituencies of the port city, the party did not achieve any success.
""Till 3pm, we had 154 NA seats. In K-P, we had 42 seats but the Election Commission gave us only 32.""
She added that the PTI's polling agents were expelled from the polling stations, and as ""night fell, the results were changed"".
Seemabia Tahir said that PTI's Dr Yasmin Rashid was winning from NA-130, but on Feb 9, Nawaz Sharif was declared the winner from the constituency.
""The results of NA-47 were also rigged against Shoaib Shaheen,” she said. “The PTI achieved a significant lead in NA-56 Rawalpindi, but PML-N's Hanif Abbasi stole our mandate as night fell.
""In a similar manner, NA-236 was also targeted for rigging. We won all the seats from Karachi but we were not declared victorious on even one.""
Party leader and senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja claimed that rigging took place ""from the polling station to the RO's office"".
""The results which should have been announced based on Form 45 were completely changed. They rigged the elections on the night of Feb 8 as much as was possible,"" Raja said. ""Before the polls, security forces were used fully and independent candidates were denied the right to campaign for elections.""
The senior lawyer said, ""These elections are an open attack on democracy.""
Earlier, PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan demanded that the US should adopt a tough stance on “rigging” the recent general elections.
After meeting Imran at the Adiala Jail, PTI leader Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, accompanied by former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, told the media that the former premier had pushed the US to take a tougher stance on the recent general polls.
He quoted Imran as saying that in the manner in which the PTI was ousted from the polls, the US should be more vocal.

9,Pagara raises spectre of martial law,GDA’s anti-rigging sit-in jams M9 motorway; alliance chief claims election results ‘sold’ in advance,"Tens of thousands of supporters of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) staged a sit-in against alleged rigging in Feb 8 elections on the M9 Motorway that connected Sindh’s two largest cities of Karachi and Hyderabad on Friday.
GDA head Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi predicted that PML-N and the PPP coalition government, which he described as a “Khichree”, would last for hardly 8 to 10 months. After that time, he added, emergency or martial law might crop up as the establishment would have “tried and tested” all parties.
He alleged that the election results were ‘sold’ for advance ‘payment’ months before the polling day.
This was the GDA’s first demonstration against what it called the “vote fraud” in Jamshoro district. A massive turnout was witnessed for the sit-in as tens of thousands of followers of Pir Pagara, and other supporters of the GDA participated.
Besides leaders from the constituent parties of the GDA, provincial leaders of several other parties, including Jamat-e-Islami (JI), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the nationalist leaders also attended the sit-in and addressed the protesters.
Speaking from a bridge on the M9 motorway, which was turned into the stage for the speakers, Pir Pagara, the head of the GDA, predicted that a next “hodge-podge” government of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) would not last beyond 8-10 months.

In a hard-hitting speech, the GDA chief warned that Pakistan might face emergency-like situation or even a martial law because the establishment had tried and tested all mainstream political parties and “… the same judges will be seen protecting this move [elections] and giving it a legal cover.”
Pir Pagara alleged that the election results were “sold” against “advance payment” months before the polling day. Still, he added, the alliance did not boycott the elections because they wanted to expose the massive “rigging”.
Pir Pagara asked the power that be, who take decisions for the country, to acknowledge a concerning fact that a national party or leader was no longer available at present. “No political party or leader now exists at the national level, all are confined to their respective provinces,” he observed.
“Now who is left to look after the Federation except the army?” he posed a question. “The army is our own. We can’t even think of distancing ourselves from the army which is looking after the federation,” he stated.

He said that the protest was their constitutional right but their purpose was to condemn the alleged robbery of their mandate. He explained that his lack of interest in the election campaign was based on the information that election results had been sold some three months before the election day.
“Such a big buy and sell occurred in this general election but why is the ECP [Election Commission of Pakistan] still asleep?” Pir Pagara, whose party was an ally of the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, raised the question.
“You have noticed that during the elections I did not go anywhere and stayed at home. Friends kept asking me to hold public rallies and meetings, but I refused,” he said. “A large public meeting costs Rs100 million. Spending such a huge amount after knowing the outcome would have been wasteful.”
Pir Pagara blamed the ECP for singling out the PTI on the basis of its intra-party elections. He argued that the way PTI conducted the intra-party election was no different from the process of electing party leadership in PML-N, PPP and even the GDA.

He also opposed labelling PTI founding chairman Imran Khan as thief just because he bought some items from Toshakhana. He told the rally that all the former prime ministers and presidents of the country had done the same.
“In my view Imran Khan is not a thief though he might have committed some stupid mistakes. We all commit these mistakes. If Imran Khan is a thief, then we all are thieves,” he said. He termed PTI supporters a flood. “If the path of a deluge is blocked at one place it drowns the other place.”

He said the overwhelming victory of the independent candidates, mainly the PTI-backed candidates, was a lesson in this direction. “If you won’t give justice and respect to the people in this country, they will try to find some other way to get justice,” he warned.
He also accused the PML-N and the PPP coalition of unleashing skyrocketing inflation which had been causing a rapid dwindling of the country’s middle class. He advised the establishment not to ignore this ongoing disappearance of the middle class, which, he said, was indispensable for a developing country.

Other leaders, who spoke before Pir Pagara, suggested protest measures such as laying siege to the Sindh Assembly at the time of oath taking of the newly-elected lawmakers and even surrounding the residences of the returning officers. However, no such reaction was mentioned in Pir Pagara’s speech. He said that he would consult with the allies to chalk out the future course of action. GDA General Secretary Safdar Abbassi announced that their next sit-in demonstration would be held on February 20 in Moro, Naushehroferoze district.
In the speech, Pir Pagara’s younger brother, Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi, urged the Supreme Court to take suo moto notice of the “election fraud”, reminding the apex court that the polling on February 8 happened on its order.
Another GDA leader Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi demanded that the returning officers (ROs) and the district returning officers (DROs) should be booked for treason under Article 6 of the Constitution because their “robbery of the people’s mandate” amounted to conspiracy against the country.
JI’s Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, JUI-F’s Rashid Mehmood Soomro, Qaumi Awami Tehreek’s Ayaz Latif Palijo, Sindh Taraqi Pasand Party’s Qadir Magsi and other speakers demanded cancellation of the election results. They called for calling new elections immediately.
