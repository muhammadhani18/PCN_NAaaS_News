0,Murree admin lifts snow emergency,"This winter, the snow fell in late January and attracted only 20% of the tourists","The city administration has finally ended the snow emergency in the popular hill station, Malika Kohsar Murree, after dull snowfall season, less tourists and low business activities.
Traders lost millions of rupees owing to low bookings at guesthouses, hotels, motels, while all seasonal snowfall stalls across Murree have been badly affected. Shopkeepers in the central markets say their 80% of investment has sunk as they failed to sell items of the snowy season.
For almost a century, Murree has been the centre of the British government and sometimes the Hindu regime of the subcontinent. Tourist families from the Middle East and Afghanistan used to come at the hill station every year during the snow season. Families of embassies’ officials in Islamabad also would visit Murree.
The average snowfall in Murree was up to 3.25 feet between 1900 and 1970, but later it began to decrease. Now the snowfall has been reduced from 2 to 2.25 feet in the last 30 years. Intermittent snowfall would melt half of it, while the remaining used to persist in the adjacent hills till March.

Traditionally, the snowfall season in Malika Kohsar Murree used to start in late November or first decade of December, and the recreational season last from December 20 to January 10. Snowfall emergency usually occurs from Dec 20 to Feb 15. However, December 2023 remained snow-free and families from across Pakistan didn’t turn up at Murree on long winter vacations.
This winter, the snow fell in late January and attracted only 20% of the tourists. The Feb 8 elections also negatively impacted the snow activities. At present there is no snow in Murree.
This time, the snowfall season in Murree lasted only for 15 days contrary to average 50 days in the past. The number of tourists this year was less also because of the 2021 snow tsunami in the renowned hill station.

Caretaker Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Jamal Shah, and Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan, H.E. WADA Mitsuhiro, together with the other distinguished guests inaugurated the exhibition at the National Art Gallery to provide an opportunity to the visitors to witness the evolution of yakishime from its ancient roots to contemporary expressions.
The show focuses on a traditional Japanese ceramics technique yakishime (firing unglazed wares at extremely high temperatures) and introduces its history and evolution that has developed in distinctive directions in Japan from 4th and 5th centuries through present day. It features over 80 exquisite pieces from the earliest examples to the present through yakishime wares, tea vessels, food vessels, jars, containers and more that have become an essential part of everyday life in Japan.

The exhibition also presents a wide range of non-utilitarian objects created by the contemporary ceramic artists working in yakishime styles aiming to provide an opportunity to communicate this distinctively Japanese sensibility and aesthetic to the people abroad.
H.E. Ambassador WADA, while speaking at the inaugural ceremony, expressed his deep admiration for this time-honored traditional Japanese art of producing ceramic art and crafts. “One of the unique characteristics of Japanese culture is the fusion and coexistence of tradition and innovation. We are good at adding new interpretation to tradition, while respecting old methods and tastes,” he said.
Ambassador WADA pointed out that Pakistan is also known as a production center of traditional potteries with Blue Pottery from Multan which has common attractions with Yakishime. “I feel a sense of warmth and simplicity from both of them.”
The ambassador said both Japan and Pakistan have rich and diverse cultural heritage and the cultural linkages between the two friendly nations, and it can be traced back in history such as the Gandhara civilisation. “In terms of the fusion of tradition and innovation, I am looking forward to see the new phase of Pakistan’s traditional arts in next generation as well.”

2,Moribund uplift projects resurrected,From road construction to sewerage systems 478 schemes are back on track,"Work on development schemes has kicked off in Rawalpindi district after Punjab’s caretaker government restored the annual development programme (ADP) and district development funds (DDF) after the February 8 general elections.
The work on 478 old and new developmental schemes worth Rs1.35 billion for Metropolitan Corporation and Rs400 million for District Council was halted before the polls.
Of 478, there are 219 old development schemes. Authorities are in the process of issuing fresh tenders for 259 new development schemes.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the estimated cost of all projects has increased by approximately Rs300 million despite the availability of funds from the last three months.
The prices of cement, sand, gravel, brick, wood and tiles have witnessed a visible increase, they added.
The development schemes include the construction of roads and street drains, boundary walls of cemeteries, funeral homes, sewerage, and installation of new tube wells and water filtration plants in 78 union councils of the Metropolitan Corporation.

With the release of state funds, payment of [pending] bills to government contractors has also started, while contractors have been asked to submit their bills against the projects which have been completed or near to completion.
Contractors Association’s office-bearer Haji Abdul Qadoos has welcomed the payment of dues after a long time.
Rawalpindi faces a critical juncture with five major projects in road infrastructure and healthcare lingering incomplete.
The delay in these projects, vital for public welfare, not only incurs escalating costs but also exacerbates the hardships faced by the community.
Among the stalled initiatives, the Leh Expressway and Flood Channel and Kachehri Chowk flyover projects have yet to commence, while the Mother and Child Hospital and Rawalpindi Ring Road projects are anticipated to conclude in the upcoming year. Additionally, the Rawalpindi Institute of Urology and Kidney Transplantation (RIUT) achieved partial functionality, with the kidney transplant facility remaining inactive.

3,CDA seals IWMB information centres,Board official says action lacked prior notice,"The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) has accused the Capital Development Authority (CDA) of illegally sealing the visitors' information centres at Trail-5 and 6 of the Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) being managed by the board.
The IWMB chairperson Rina Saeed Khan took to her official handle on X (formerly Twitter) ‘to apprise the public of the rogue behaviour of the civic agency that took many aback’ as the visitor's information centres were the only source of guidance for local and foreign tourists visiting the national park's nature and biodiversity-rich hiking trails.”
In her X post, she wrote, ""URGENT: CDA thugs have come this morning and taken over our Visitor Info Center on Trail 5 throwing out IWMB furniture. This building was made by Himalayan Wildlife Foundation not CDA and we have handing over documents. We are going to police and courts now!.""
She also shared the official order of CDA allocating the land of existing information centres to the board for establishing its offices whereas any handing or taking over of the building would be carried out through the Environment Directorate of the CDA through intimation to the Authority's Administrative Directorate.

The statement further said “the CDA officials acted without notice and ignored all legal aspects.""
When contacted, the CDA spokesperson hanged up and gave a silent treatment to the queries on the matter.

4,Heavyweights losing polls shun public gatherings,Post-election political activities and candidates’ celebrations fade,"All prominent political figures, who badly lost their seats of the National Assembly and the provincial assembly in the recently-concluded February 8 elections, have restricted their movements outside and decided not to challenge the electoral results.
Interestingly, these prominent leaders ruled the political world and remained unbeaten since the non-party elections in 1985, and have been widely covered by the media.
Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Aamir Mehmood Kayani, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan and Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who contested the polls, seem to be tight-lipped after facing defeat in the elections.
On the other hand, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former deputy speaker of the Punjab Assembly Wasiq Qayyum Abbasi, ex-ministers Fayyaz Chauhan and Sadaqat Abbasi are some other political personalities who chose to stay away from contesting election. Nowadays, they are seen justifying their decisions in political gatherings.

Even PML-N candidates, who have won their seats, have yet to celebrate their wins. Hardly a few dozen party activists sans voters distributed sweets at party’s central offices on Feb 9.
The victorious candidates also couldn’t stage any significant rallies in Rawalpindi despite their best efforts and tremendous pressure and it appears that the winners look more depressed than the losers.
Electoral offices of all winning and unsuccessful candidates of major stature remain empty. Political workers of all parties also look confused about the fast-changing political scenario.
