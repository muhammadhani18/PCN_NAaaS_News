0,"Poor governance : All eyes on MQM, PPP to address Karachi’s issues","The city is engulfed in a myriad of crises like poor sewerage, broken infrastructure","With the long overdue election results now almost entirely in, it is clear that the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) bagged big win in Sindh’s provincial capital but the challenges that await both parties are the same as they always have been.
Karachi seems to be engulfed in a myriad of crises relating to infrastructure, sewage, drinking water, and transportation; and both the MQM and PPP, which have been in power in the city for a significant amount of time, know so.
However, it remains to be seen whether this time around the two political parties will actually be able to address the port city’s issues. Qazi Sadruddin, an active social worker from the city, does not think that both parties have the capacity to help the metropolis. “The PPP and MQM have been in power for many years but they have not paid any attention to solving the problems of the city. I doubt if this time will be any different but one can certainly hope,” said Sadruddin.
Younis, a 55-year-old resident of the city, agrees. “I have seen multiple governments come and go but Karachi’s problems have only exacerbated.”
Younis’s simple assessment carries weight in Dr Noman Ahmed’s view, who while talking to The Express Tribune, said that the city’s sewage was poor, water lines were faulty, road network was broken, and public transportation was miniscule in number. “Those in power, both past and present, have never paid any attention to solving these problems. For instance, the city’s sewage is so broken that even the slightest bit of rain can result in flooding. One can only hope that those who have come into power now, own this city and work to solve its problems,” remarked Dr Ahmed, who is an urban planner.
Agreeing with Dr Ahmed, Iftikhar Sheikh, the President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce, said that the business community of the metropolis was also worried about the city’s state. Sheikh suggested that all the stakeholders of the city, including the businessmen, must be gathered on one platform so that they could pay attention to the problems of Karachi, especially the improvement of the city’s infrastructure.
However, to do so would require both the MQM and the PPP to get along, according to Dr Muhammad Ali, a political analyst and associate professor at the University of Karachi. “Since the PPP will be in power in the centre, in the province, and also has the mandate of local governments, the onus falls on the PPP to include the MQM and other parties as well for the betterment of the city,” opined Dr Ali.
“A hefty development package should be created for Karachi to solve infrastructure, education, health, and other problems in Karachi,” he added.
Be that as it may, Dr Osama Razi, leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami in Karachi, was of the view that parties which had destroyed the city could not fix it. “The PPP and MQM are responsible for the destruction of Karachi, they cannot help it now,” asserted Dr Razi while talking to The Express Tribune.

1,‘Motorbike ambulances’ rolled out,They are designed to reach patients within a 5 to 8-minute timeframe,"Emergency motorbikes equipped with life-saving medical tools have been rolled out in the metropolitan city.
These two-wheeler ambulances aim to address accidents in traffic jams and narrow streets, providing quick first aid to the injured within the metropolis.
The Sindh Health Department, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO), has supplied 25 emergency motorcycles to the Sindh Integrated Emergency and Health Services (1122).
Caretaker Health Minister Dr Saad Khalid Niaz received the bikes, complete with contemporary medical equipment, from the WHO and handed them over to 1122 at the EPI Centre.
Equipped with a fire extinguisher, mini medicine kit, 25 emergency bags, oxygen mask, pulse oximeter, glucometer, oxygen cylinder key, nasal cannula, polyneck hard collar, stethoscope, CPR mask, nebulizer, and dressing kit, these motorbike ambulances promise a rapid response.
They are designed to reach patients within a 5 to 8-minute timeframe, delivering quick treatment or transporting them to the nearest ambulance.
While addressing a press conference on Thursday, the caretaker health minister said that these bikes and equipment form a rapid response force, addressing areas lacking conventional vehicles.
With the current program having 371 emergency bikes but requiring 1,100, Dr Niaz suggested the WHO establish its accountability framework to ensure proper utilisation of supplies.
Dr Sara, head of WHO Sindh, highlighted that paramedical staff would undergo 15-day training.
Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) are set to take these emergency bikes out on the streets for 3 to 6 months, along with training in early April.
Rescue 1122 authorities clarified that the primary responsibility is to quickly assist people affected by accidents or medical emergencies in congested traffic, narrow lanes, or remote locations.
Despite appearing as typical heavy motorcycles, these vehicles are, in fact, ambulances equipped with modern medical equipment and technology.

3,Controversial polls: JUI-F on warpath,Announces closure of inter-provincial land links,"Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Sindh staged a protest demonstration outside the Provincial Election Commission office in Karachi against the alleged electoral fraud.
JUI-F Sindh Secretary General Allama Rashid Mahmood Soomro addressed the gathering, stating that JUI-F has decided to launch a nationwide movement against “doctored election results.”
He asserted that Sindh has witnessed the worst electoral fraud, with constituency delimitations made to favour the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), and appointments of Returning Officers (ROs) and the District Returning Officers (DROs) influenced by Wadera Shahi.
He lampooned the Sindh Election Commission, the bureaucracy and the state institutions, which according to him were helpless against the powerful waderas of Sindh on the Election Day.
JUI leaders, including Maulana Abdul Kareem Abid, Qari Usman, Dr. Nasiruddin Swati, Maulana Muhammad Ghiyas, Maulana Sami-ul-Haq Swati, Maulana Noor-ul-Haq, Maulana Zareen Shah, Habibullah Andar, and Sharafuddin Andar, also addressed the gathering.
Maulana Soomro, while addressing the crowd, highlighted that police, Rangers, and army were not deployed at the sensitive constituencies in Sindh.
He criticised the authorities for leaving the mandate of Sindh's people at the mercy of landlords, citing the establishment of records of the worst electoral fraud, despite the disappearance of Form 45 and missing ballot papers. Against this injustice, JUI-Sindh has initiated a movement across the province.
Tomorrow, on Friday, workers from Ghotki and Kashmore will block roads from Kashmore, and workers from Sukkur will block roads from Sukkur. The Sindh-Punjab border will also be closed for an indefinite period. He demanded that NA-191 Kashmore, PS-02 Panu Aqil, and PS-22 Thul results be released according to Form 45.
Allama Rashid Mahmood Soomro emphasized that now they have come out among the people, and decisions will be made not in the assemblies but among the people.

Despite inflation, the prices of medicines have not been increased according to the market, due to which, “We are facing medicine shortage which are being sold at high prices, but we are taking steps to eliminate the black market of medicines.” These views were expressed by Dr. Saad Niaz while answering questions after receiving the supplies from WHO and handing them over to Rescue 1122 at EPI Centre.
Fire at hospital
Regarding a recent fire incident in the Sindh Government Hospital, Liaquatabad, the minister said that our hospitals do not have adequate firefighting arrangements, which is alarming.
Ordinary people, present in the hospital at the time of fire, were running instead of making efforts to douse the flames due to lack of training.
In the fire incident at Liaquatabad Government Hospital, there were four people whose burns were 100 per cent or 60 per cent, the families of the injured requested us to transfer the injured to the burns ward of Patel Hospital. The minister suggested the World Health Organization to create its own accountability system to ensure that supplies are used in the right place.
