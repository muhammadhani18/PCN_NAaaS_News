2,Caretaker tax collection claim disputed,K-P adviser claims the revenues dropped instead,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Advisor to the Chief Minister on Finance, Muzamal Aslam, has highlighted a significant decline in tax collection under the caretaker provincial government, indicating a 50% drop.
Speaking to the media, he refuted claims by the caretaker chief minister regarding the state of the provincial exchequer, asserting that while it wasn’t entirely empty, the funds left were not accurately represented.
Contrary to assertions of an empty treasury, Aslam stated that the caretaker government possessed adequate funds to sustain operations but failed to effectively collect taxes, undermining revenue generation efforts. He questioned the cessation of the Sehat Card program, which had been instrumental in benefiting marginalized communities, suggesting that the purportedly large funds available should have sustained such initiatives.
Regarding government borrowing, Aslam noted substantial loans acquired over the past decade, with additional agreements inked with international organizations, such as the World Bank, totaling significant financial commitments. Furthermore, he emphasized the pending payments owed by the Center to the province under the net hydal profit agreement.
Addressing concerns over the development of newly merged districts, Aslam revealed delays in the disbursement of funds allocated by the Center for this purpose. Despite assurances of financial support, little progress had been made, with salaries ballooning from Rs66 billion to Rs110 billion annually, burdening the provincial budget.
Accusing the opposition alliance and the caretaker government of inaction, Aslam criticized their failure to address the financial challenges affecting the newly merged districts. He highlighted outstanding payments for the Sehat Card Plus initiative, which had been neglected for a year, resulting in the suspension of essential healthcare services for the underprivileged.
To address the lapse, Aslam announced a reinstatement of free treatment under the Sehat Card Plus scheme, with a commitment to clear outstanding dues amounting to Rs5 billion monthly. Despite past financial constraints, the provincial government pledged a substantial allocation of Rs22 billion for the Sehat Card program in the current fiscal year.
Aslam underscored the caretaker government’s failure to honor financial obligations towards crucial projects initiated by the PTI government, such as the Sehat Card Plus initiative. Despite its significance in providing essential healthcare, the project faced funding cuts under the caretaker administration, illustrating a disregard for the welfare of the populace.
In December last year, the caretaker government’s decision to reduce the budget allocation for the Sehat Card Plus program exacerbated financial difficulties, further straining healthcare access for vulnerable communities.
Talking to The Express Tribune an official of the health department said that several categories for the treatment were being introduced and data of the families living below poverty line is being obtained from NADRA after consultation with the Benezir Income Support Program (BISP).
“It has also been decided that small surgeries like tonsillitis, appendix and C section will be performed in public sector hospitals only,” he said.

4,Shisham trees face threat of extinction,Dieback disease had hit hard the species across several districts,"The gradual disappearance of shisham trees, an indigenous species vital to the subcontinent’s ecology, has become a cause for concern in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP), primarily due to the prevalence of dieback disease. This alarming trend has prompted environmentalists to advocate for advanced research studies to save this economically beneficial species from the brink of extinction.
Former Forests Conservator Gulzar Rehman has raised the alarm about the endangerment of shisham trees in several districts of KP, including Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Nowshera, and Swabi. These areas have witnessed a high infestation rate of dieback, also known as cancer, posing a significant threat to the survival of shisham trees.
Rehman emphasized the urgent need for advanced research and investigations to combat this devastating disease, which often targets shisham trees at a young age.
The problem of dieback in shisham is not a recent phenomenon; it has been documented since the early 1900s. In his book ‘Pathology of Trees Volume-II,’ renowned pathologist Dr. AH Khan revealed that dieback in shisham was first observed in the subcontinent in the early 1900s.
Various fungi, including Ganoderma lucidum, were identified as contributing factors to the decline of shisham trees. The introduction of shisham in 1866, initially intended for producing coal for the railways, turned out to be a multifaceted boon for farmers and the middle class due to its diverse range of uses and benefits.
However, recent outbreaks of dieback have led to significant economic losses for farmers who rely on shisham trees for financial stability. Kamal Ahmed, a farmer from Mohib Banda in Nowshera district, recounted how he had planted shisham trees with the hope of securing his family’s future.
Yet, last year, he faced a great financial setback when 12 of his shisham trees fell victim to the disease. Such losses have prompted farmers like Ahmed to consider alternative tree species like Mulberry and Poplar, which are less susceptible to dieback.
The impact of dieback on shisham trees is evident in various regions of KP, where once-lush landscapes adorned with shisham trees now present a dismal sight of dried-up vegetation. The upper Swat canal, Michi canal in Dargai Malakand, and Harichand in Charsadda are just a few examples of areas where shisham trees have succumbed to the disease.
Dr Mumtaz Malik, Secretary of Environment and Forests, highlighted the global nature of the dieback problem, with similar occurrences reported in neighboring countries like India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
He attributed the spread of dieback in shisham trees to factors such as the expansion of shisham trees into areas beyond their natural habitats, leaving them vulnerable to the deadly disease.
