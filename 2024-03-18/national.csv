0,Exploring potential of Islamic social finance,"Such financing creates financial instruments that address social issues, promote equitable society","Islamic finance is the area of finance that complies with Shariah guidelines and the Islamic commercial law while avoiding transactions involving interest, speculation, gambling and artificial financial instruments.
Generally, when we refer to Islamic finance, our focus is on the commercial aspect of finance that includes Islamic banking, Islamic insurance, Shariah-compliant mutual funds and Sukuk. According to the London Stock Exchange Group reports, the size of Islamic commercial finance has surpassed $4.5 trillion globally and it is expected to reach $6.6 trillion by 2027.
However, the domain of Islamic finance also includes Islamic social finance, an integral area that not only broadens the reach of Islamic finance to almost all Muslims but also has the potential to contribute at the global level towards sustainable growth and economic development of society.
Islamic social finance is a multifaceted approach that blends Islamic finance principles with a focus on principles of justice, equity, social responsibility and community welfare. It aims to address socio-economic inequalities, promote sustainable development and foster community cohesion.
This unique financial framework aligns with Islamic ethics and values, offering an alternative to conventional finance systems. In essence, Islamic social finance seeks to create financial instruments that not only comply with the Shariah law but also address social issues by integrating ethical and moral considerations into financial practices and seeks to create a more inclusive and equitable society.
At the heart of Islamic social finance is the principle of Shariah compliance. Islamic law prohibits activities involving interest, speculation, deception, gambling and unethical investments while emphasising ethical and equitable financial dealings. This foundation shapes Islamic finance as a whole, and in the realm of social finance, it guides the development of instruments that prioritise societal well-being.
During the last 1,450 years of Islamic history, the areas of Islamic social finance have played a pivotal role in not only supporting Muslim societies in times of need but also supporting economic development and sustainable growth.
Islamic social finance instruments primarily include Zakat (obligatory almsgiving), Sadaqah (voluntary charity), Waqf (endowment and trusts) and Qarz al-Hasan (benevolent interest-free loans) while innovative developments in the area now also cover Islamic microfinance, Social Sukuk, socially responsible investment and Islamic crowdfunding and ethical investments. The above-mentioned instruments, if used properly, can provide much-needed stimulus and support to the economy.

Islamic social finance can directly contribute to wealth distribution to the lower segment of society to reduce poverty, enhance social welfare and broaden the safety net for the needy, channel support to welfare institutions in the area of education, health and public welfare, create growth and employment opportunities for small entrepreneurs and startups, help in disaster recovery and rehabilitation, encourage ethical investments and support sustainable community development.
Let us look briefly at some of the main instruments of Islamic social finance and their potential in the economy.
Zakat is one of the main components of Islamic social finance. It is an obligatory form of almsgiving in Islam. Rich Muslims are required to donate annually a portion of their wealth (usually 2.5%) to support the less fortunate, thus fostering social solidarity.
Zakat serves as a redistributive mechanism, helping to reduce wealth inequality and alleviate poverty within Muslim communities. With a global Muslim population of 1.8 billion, the global estimates for Zakat range from $200 billion to $1 trillion. While for Pakistan, the estimated potential is over Rs2.7 trillion. A correct and transparent transfer of this amount to the poor and needy can bring an economic revolution in Muslim societies.
Sadaqah refers to the voluntary charitable giving beyond the obligatory Zakat. Muslims are encouraged to give charity as a means of seeking spiritual rewards and helping others.
Although Zakat has specific guidelines, Sadaqah is more flexible and can be directed towards a wider range of charitable activities, including education, healthcare, employment generation and infrastructure development.
The concept of Sadaqah is found in all Muslim societies and when compared to taxation, people happily and willingly donate for good causes and to support others. Particularly, in the month of Ramazan and on Eid festivals, we see an increased level of charity towards the poor in various forms.
A portion of this charity is also directed towards welfare organisations that are contributing to social well-being by reducing the burden of the government. Waqf or endowment involves the permanent dedication of assets, such as land, buildings or financial resources, for specific charitable or religious purposes. The income generated from Waqf assets is used to support various social, educational or religious initiatives.
Throughout Islamic history, Waqf establishments have held pivotal positions, offering societal benefits such as education and healthcare, essential public infrastructure like roads, bridges and shelters, vital utilities such as water and sanitation services, religious amenities including the construction and upkeep of mosques and burial grounds, aid for the impoverished, orphans and the less fortunate, fostering employment opportunities, and bolstering the agricultural and industrial sectors, all without burdening governmental resources. A World Bank report estimated the global Waqf assets at over $700 billion.
The Waqf assets, if utilised efficiently and provided corporate governance framework, can contribute significantly to public welfare and economic growth.
Islamic microfinance, another crucial aspect of Islamic social finance, empowers small entrepreneurs and low-income individuals by normally providing them with interest-free loans or equity-based and trade-based financing. This approach aligns with Islamic finance principles by avoiding the burden of interest payments on borrowers. Social Sukuk is a notable development. Sukuk are investment vehicles that are linked to real assets, projects or real trade transactions.
Social Sukuk provides opportunities for investors to invest in impact-creating ventures while providing funding according to Islamic finance rules for projects with societal benefits, such as affordable housing, renewable energy or healthcare facilities.
In conclusion, Islamic social finance is a dynamic intersection of Islamic finance principles and social responsibility. To promote wider adoption, it is essential to create awareness among both Muslims and non-Muslims about its principles and benefits. Education and outreach programmes can dispel misconceptions and highlight the positive impact of ethical and socially responsible financial practices.
As the global financial landscape continues to evolve, Islamic social finance serves as a testament to the compatibility of ethical finance with sustainable development goals.

1,Escaping low-level equilibrium trap,"Policymakers must overhaul strategy as it lacks innovation, pro-competitive forces","Economic conditions, as depicted through various statistics, have started getting better as certainty in the political environment improved in recent months, leading up to general elections in February 2024.
Recent figures of exports, published by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), indicate an upward trend. Exports since October 2023 have surpassed the threshold of $2.5 billion every month.
This is significant given that they had been hovering below this threshold for several months, especially after nearly touching $3 billion in early 2022.
Pakistan’s economy has faced significant challenges, as its growth, imports as well as industrial output slowed down in 2022 and 2023.
Although the recurring balance of payments crisis is the driving factor behind the continually dismal performance of the economy, the slowdown has also implications for supply chains, the availability of essential products and their prices.
Pakistan has not only experienced a shortage of commodities across several sectors but also the highest levels of inflation in its history. As the country is going to receive its final tranche from the IMF under the current programme and prepares to enter another programme, it must adopt policies that ensure the balance of payments crisis becomes less frequent.
Consequently, the economy will not only thrive but also the country will be able to abandon the habit of approaching the IMF for a lifeline after every few years.
The balance of payments crisis is typically a result of poor foreign exchange reserves management as the lack of inflows causes it to plunge to levels that create uncertainty in the exchange rate. Low reserves often lead to speculation in the foreign exchange market, increasing the risk of currency depreciation.

To boost the reserves, Pakistan has three non-debt creating avenues, namely exports, remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI).
While FDI has been negligible, dollar inflows through remittances and exports are relatively important. Pakistan has done well in terms of inward remittances, as it is the second largest recipient in South Asia in absolute value and as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).
According to recent estimates of the World Bank, the inflow of remittances into Pakistan was almost $30 billion in 2022, or 8% of GDP.
However, Pakistan has performed dismally in exports. Its exports were at 10.5% of GDP in 2022, slightly more than half the average of 20.5% reported for the South Asian region.
Several sub-Saharan African countries, given their poorer levels of development and geographical location, report a higher value of exports as a percentage of GDP.
Even though China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has often been portrayed as a project that will improve trade connectivity with the rest of the region and the world, the performance of exports speaks volumes about the ordeal policymakers face to make economic conditions more sustainable and less dependent on the IMF.
Several experts set thresholds and benchmarks for export performance. The World Bank believes that exports are $60 billion below their potential, while other experts have proposed methods and suggestions to boost exports beyond $100 billion.
According to trade statistics provided by the International Trade Centre, Pakistan exported goods worth $11 billion in 2003 while Vietnam and Chile had exports of $20 billion.
In 2022, Vietnam exported goods valuing at $370 billion, Chile exported $102 billion worth of goods while Pakistan reported meagre shipments of $31 billion.
Exports of Vietnam increased more than 18 times, exports of Chile rose more than five times, but exports of Pakistan increased less than three times.
Both Chile and Vietnam have reported a significant growth in their economic performance as their development levels skyrocketed in the last 20 years.
Their policymakers have created an environment that contributed to the growth of the capacities of their firms and the capabilities of their manpower by introducing a pro-competitive business environment that encourages rather than discourages international trading activities. This is missing from the economic policy landscape in Pakistan.
According to the tariff profile available at World Bank’s World Integrated Trade Solution, Pakistan had eight tariff agreements in 2021 and reported weighted average tariff rates of more than 9%.
In comparison, Chile had 76 tariff agreements and weighted average tariff rate of 0.76%, while Vietnam had 20 tariff agreements and a weighted tariff rate of 1.17%.
The high level of protection given to the targeted sectors in Pakistan proves its lack of integration into the global and regional markets. Better integration is necessary to boost exports.
On the other hand, Pakistan lacks measures that improve the quality of Pakistani products as producers often neglect needs to protect consumer safety and interests.
The global market has shifted towards addressing the needs of consumers as products must comply with pre-defined quality and production standards and processes. The policy landscape must address the lack of non-tariff measures.
Furthermore, Pakistan faces challenges as it fails to take advantage of its large unskilled workforce and improve its productive capabilities to boost exports.
With a population of approximately 250 million, Pakistan has abundant labour resources to produce labour-intensive exportable goods. However, with the evolution of labour-saving technologies that help to reduce costs even for the most labour-intensive methods, it is essential to upgrade not only the production capacities but also the capabilities of the workforce.
Raising the productivity levels will increase the probability that firms participate in international trading activities. This involves not only making complementary capital investments but also investing in human capital capabilities through vocational training and skill development programmes.
Pakistan will boost its exports only if producers realise the importance of providing the best possible products at the most efficient prices.
Unfortunately, the current incentive structure involves government intervention, which not only focuses on large subsidies for exporters but also the increasing demand from lobbies to reduce their energy costs. Little attention is paid to complementary investments in facilities and infrastructure.
In addition, the government offers protection to inefficient producers in the domestic market, which results in an anti-export bias and deters exporters from meeting the needs of consumers in the global market as high profit margins are often guaranteed in the domestic market.
The current incentive structure suggests that businesses favour low-value and low-risk transactions rather than compete for a larger stake in more competitive markets.
In essence, the policymakers must go for the overhaul of strategies which have resulted in a low-level equilibrium that lacks innovation and pro-competitive forces. It is imperative to devise a strategic framework that forces a dynamic change in the business environment, encouraging participation in international trading activities.

2,Unforeseen consequences of US-China trade war,"As US boosts hi-tech manufacturing, trade deficits find new paths amid global trade realignment","Four years ago, when the US-China trade war resulted in tariffs on roughly $450 billion worth of goods, it was hailed as a game changer in international trade and geopolitics.
Although Sino-US trade figures dipped afterwards, the situation was exacerbated by chip shortage during Covid-19, making the case for prioritising US self-reliance in hi-tech manufacturing.
Additionally, Beijing began to exercise quotas in the global supply of rare-earth metals – crucial for many strategic projects, including the manufacturing of F-35 jets.
All these developments foresaw a resurgence of manufacturing and mining in the US, aimed at keeping the US-China trade deficit in check. But the question remains: Did it work? Has manufacturing returned to the US? And have the soaring trade deficits been contained?
It appears that progress has been made on the manufacturing front. Thanks to Biden’s Chips and Science Act of 2022, hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed to research and domestic production of semiconductor devices.
Intel is constructing a new plant in Ohio, while Micron is advancing with its factory in Idaho. Foreign investments are pouring in to establish billion-dollar computer chip factories in Phoenix, Arizona. The demand for engineers has surged so much that Arizona State University expanded its engineering programme by nearly 33%.
Read: US-China thaw to facilitate talks on WTO reform
As of today, the Chips Act has led to $157 billion worth of projects, creating over 25,000 jobs in advanced manufacturing facilities.
Taiwanese semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) has allocated over $40 billion for operations in Arizona. However, many investors planned expansions in the US semiconductor market during the Covid-19 chip shortage when they were inundated with orders.
But now companies like Microchip are burdened with large inventories of unsold components and are dependent on defence department subsidies and Chips Act grants.
It now remains to be seen whether such mega investments in new fads can be sustained without federal government subsidies. If not, it seems that Washington has taken a page out of Beijing’s playbook by embracing state-sponsored development in computer chips and injecting targeted subsidies.
Now, addressing the second question regarding the Sino-US trade deal: Did trade deficits decrease?
For the US, both exports and imports essentially plateaued within a few months, and the trade deficit with China did not widen any further since the imposition of an average tariff of 18%. However, the decline in the trade deficit with China was offset by increases in deficits with Mexico, Taiwan and Vietnam.
Additionally, China reports significantly more exports to the US than the official figures for Chinese imports quoted by US officials. In fact, since the trade war, China’s total exports have increased by about $1 trillion globally.
This is due to the extensive use of the de minimis exception by Chinese firms, allowing packages of less than $800 to enter the US without paying customs duty or tariffs. Such cases are not formally counted in the US trade data.
Moreover, we see more Chinese manufacturers relocating their assembly plants to Vietnam and Thailand. For example, Chinese solar panels are now being produced in Vietnam to avoid high US tariffs.
Beijing seems to be redirecting a significant portion of its exports to the US by exporting to “proxy” nations that are rising in the ranks of US trade partners. For instance, China’s exports to Mexico in 2023 were about 80% higher than in the pre-Covid year of 2019, while Mexico’s share of exports to the US reached a record high of 15.5%.
In summary, the US tariffs on Chinese goods have benefited China’s rivals in emerging markets, who are apparently benefiting from friend-shoring. Instead of China running large surpluses with the US, trade proxies like Mexico, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines are all experiencing significant surpluses in trade with the US.

3,"Same old govt, new economic path?",Proposing four key reforms to transform the nation’s economic landscape,"Pakistan held a general election on February 8th, 2024, and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) formed its government on March 4th, 2024. Mian Shehbaz Sharif, who led the previous government under the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition, is the current prime minister.
However, according to major macroeconomic indicators like inflation, growth rate, and unemployment, the performance of the PDM government hasn’t been impressive.
When PDM assumed office in April 2022, the economy was not functioning well. Rather than pursuing structural reforms that could bring long-term gains, the government decided to maintain the status quo and stabilise the economy using conventional tools that have a long history of failure. As a result, almost two years have passed, and the economic situation remains dire.
The new government may repeat past mistakes, but good hope remains for economic reforms. In this article, I propose four major reforms that can benefit the economy in the long run.
Firstly, rationalising the current economic model is a complex but necessary task. The model has failed and will only produce the same results if it remains in its present form. It has weak institutions, relies on debts and remittances, has an uncompetitive industrial structure, declining exports, brain drain, a lower tax base, economic uncertainty, regulatory burden, and a large government size.
To survive, the government is raising taxes at the cost of savings, consumption, and citizens’ welfare.
It is necessary to audit the entire economic structure, analysing what works and what does not, and removing all inefficiencies.
Without it, no policy is effective since these inefficiencies are deeply embedded in the present model. This long, continuous process needs improvement at each stage but must be done as soon as possible.
Secondly, creating state institutions that ensure the rule of law and accountability.
Read: Economy to do better: Fitch
It also requires a strong political commitment despite high political costs to the dominant state institutions that maintain the status quo. They may prefer to keep their present position. But if they are concerned about the country’s development, they must not create barriers to institutional reforms.
Thirdly, we require market-led reforms that facilitate the growth of the private sector in the market. The private sector is the main driving force behind economic development, job creation, tax revenue, lower inflation, and an improved standard of living for the citizens. A stronger market paves the way for a stronger economy.
Unfortunately, doing business in Pakistan is not easy due to various factors. Some are institutional, such as corruption and regulatory burdens, while others are structural, such as a lower comparative advantage in the competitive market. To address these issues, we need institutional reforms to tackle the former and industrial policy to address the latter.
My fourth suggestion is about industrial policy. It doesn’t involve creating a further government footprint in the market while eliminating some. Its economic justification is simple: internalising externalities to capture learning and innovation and offsetting those externalities that cause market failure. Its objective is to promote industrial development to improve productive capacity and diversification in the economy and to facilitate some industries to gain a comparative advantage in the local and international markets. It will ultimately increase the market size and boost the export sector.
Regarding industrial policy, the most influential economist, Dani Rodrik, warns, “The kind of discipline that’s required is the discipline of monitoring, figuring out whether what you’re doing is working, and being able to move away from mistakes when things aren’t working. Successful industrial policy is not about picking winners; it’s about letting the losers go. Some of the worst cases of industrial policy are when you keep putting good money after bad.”
Therefore, before starting the industrial policy, Pakistan must ensure its policymakers and political economy are efficient enough to maintain that discipline Rodrik advises. Otherwise, a new industrial policy will create new evils.
Almost all industrialised countries, including East Asian economies, have achieved economic success due to the abovementioned factors. These are not easy to implement and require strong political commitment, which is why not all countries are successful economically.
However, the evidence confirms that these policies work and have contributed to the economic success of many countries.

4,The urgent need for population control in Pakistan,One of the most significant repercussions of rapid population growth is a strained economy,"With a population exceeding 220 million and growing at a rate of 2% per year, Pakistan, as it grapples with numerous socio-economic challenges, stands today as the fifth most populous country in the world.
This rapid population growth rate of 2% demands immediate attention and comprehensive strategies to bring it lower. If growth continues at this rate the population of Pakistan by 2050 will reach 355 million.
This increase, of about 130 million, is tantamount to relocating the entire population of Mexico to Pakistan.
One of the most significant repercussions of rapid population growth is the strain it places on the economy. With limited resources and a burgeoning population, there is a continuous struggle to provide essential services such as education, healthcare, and employment opportunities.
Reducing the population growth rate would alleviate the economic burden, allowing for more effective distribution of resources and increased investment in key sectors.
Education is a fundamental pillar for the progress of any society. However, the exponential growth in population has led to overburdened educational systems, resulting in inadequate facilities and compromised quality of education.
By reducing the population growth rate, the government can focus on improving the education sector, ensuring better access and quality, thus nurturing a more skilled and knowledgeable workforce.
An expanding population puts immense pressure on healthcare infrastructure, leading to a scarcity of resources and compromised medical services. A reduced population growth rate would allow the healthcare system to function more efficiently, ensuring improved accessibility to quality healthcare services for all citizens.
The increasing population exacerbates the challenge of unemployment and poverty. With limited job opportunities, a growing youth population faces difficulties in securing sustainable livelihoods. By curbing population growth, the government can channel resources towards creating employment opportunities, thereby alleviating poverty and fostering economic development.
Rapid population growth contributes to environmental degradation through increased demand for natural resources, deforestation, and heightened carbon emissions. A lower population growth rate would facilitate sustainable resource management and environmental conservation, promoting a healthier and more balanced ecosystem.
Family planning initiatives play a crucial role in empowering women by providing them with control over their reproductive choices. Reducing the population growth rate involves promoting women’s health, education, and economic independence. This, in turn, leads to healthier families, improved child-rearing practices, and increased overall well-being.
Read: Family planning drive termed imperative
An expanding population strains existing infrastructure, resulting in congestion, inadequate housing, and overburdened transportation systems.
Reducing the population growth rate would enable the government to invest in infrastructure development, ensuring sustainable urban planning and improved living conditions for citizens.
A rapidly growing population can lead to social instability as resources become scarce, competition intensifies, and disparities widen. By addressing population growth, Pakistan can enhance social stability, fostering harmony and cooperation among its diverse communities.
Reducing the population growth rate necessitates a multi-faceted approach, which must include the following elements,
1) Comprehensive Family Planning:
Implementing robust family planning programmes to raise awareness and provide accessible contraceptives.
2) Education and Awareness:
Promoting education and awareness campaigns to enlighten the public about the advantages of smaller family sizes.
3) Women’s Empowerment:
Focusing on empowering women through education, employment opportunities, and healthcare access.
4) Economic Development:
Prioritising economic development to create jobs and improve living standards, discouraging large family sizes.
5) Government Policies:
Enforcing policies that incentivise smaller families and penalise unchecked population growth.
The importance of reducing the population growth rate in Pakistan cannot be overstated.
Addressing this critical issue is paramount to ensuring sustainable development, economic prosperity, and improved quality of life for all citizens.
Through comprehensive and concerted efforts, Pakistan can chart a path towards a more balanced and sustainable future, fostering a society where each individual can thrive.
It is imperative to understand that population policy is the lynchpin of the country’s policy structure. All other policies, education, health, development, transport, labour, employment, infrastructure and so on, depend for their success on limiting population growth. If this lynchpin fails the entire structure, no matter the integrity of its components, crashes to the ground.
Sadly, we do not see the issue of addressing population growth on the list of priorities of any of the major political parties or of the country’s economic planning establishment. They do not seem to understand that if we do not tackle this issue much of whatever else we do will be in vain.
