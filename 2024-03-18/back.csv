Ambassador Jiang echoed the sentiments, underscoring the special importance China accords to Pakistan and its firm support for Pakistan’s socioeconomic development, and industrial and agriculture cooperation. He also agreed with the foreign minister on high-quality development of CPEC Phase-II.
Last week, a Chinese foreign minister spokesperson stated that China attaches high importance to promoting its relations with Pakistan and stands ready to jointly work to carry forward traditional friendship and advance practical cooperation between the two countries.
“We send our warm congratulations to Mr Zardari on assumption as president,” Wang Wenbin said in his regular briefing while commenting on the oath-taking of Asif Ali Zardari as President of Pakistan.
He emphasized the significance Beijing attaches to upgrading the China-Pakistan All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership to build an even closer community with a shared future in the new era.

1,Iceland volcano still pouring out fountains of lava,The eruption was the seventh on the Reykjanes peninsula near Iceland's capital Reykjavik since 2021,"A volcano in Iceland that erupted on Saturday for the fourth time since December was still spewing smoke and bright orange lava into the air early on Monday although infrastructure and a nearby fishing town were safe for now, authorities said.
The eruption was the seventh on the Reykjanes peninsula near Iceland's capital Reykjavik since 2021 when geological systems that had lain dormant for around 800 years again became active.
Man-made barriers have been successful in steering the lava away from infrastructure including the Svartsengi geothermal power plant and Grindavik, a fishing town of some 4,000 residents.
Footage from public broadcaster RUV showed lava flowing a few hundred metres from the town which was evacuated during an eruption in November and again during another one in February.
""The defences at Grindavik proved their value ... they have guided the lava flow in the intended direction,"" local utility HS Orka said, adding that infrastructure running to the Svartsengi power plant was intact.
Magma had been accumulating underground since the last eruption in February, prompting authorities to warn of an imminent eruption.
The warning time late on Saturday was only 15 minutes before fountains of molten rock began soaring from a 3km-long (1.9 mile) fissure, roughly the same size and at the same place as the eruption in February.
Lava flows continued at a steady pace on Monday, and it was too early to project when it would end, Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson, professor of geophysics at the University of Iceland, told RUV.
""It was surprisingly stable overnight and certainly majestic, but is still only between 2-5% of what it was at the beginning,"" he said.
The February eruption lasted less than two days while volcanic activity continued for six months at a nearby system in 2021.

2,"Kremlin says Russia is consolidated around Putin, dismisses West's criticism","Putin won 87%, or 76 million votes, by far the biggest landslide in post-Soviet Russian history","The Kremlin said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin's re-election showed the Russian people were consolidated around him and that Moscow was not interested in Washington's criticism as the United States was de-facto at war with Russia in Ukraine.
Putin won 87%, or 76 million votes, by far the biggest landslide in post-Soviet Russian history, according to official results after nearly all the votes had been counted. Turnout was more than 77%, also the biggest in Russia's post-Soviet history.
""This is the most eloquent confirmation of the level of support from the population of the country for its president, and its consolidation around him,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
The White House said the Russian elections were ""obviously not free nor fair"" as Putin had imprisoned his opponents and prevented others from running against him.
""We strongly disagree with this assessment from the United States,"" Peskov said.
""Such assessments are expected and predictable, given that de-facto the United States is a country deeply involved in the war in Ukraine. This is a country that is, in fact, at war with us.""
""This is not an opinion that we are ready to listen to and that is even important to us.""
Peskov said that if the West wanted to talk about the illegitimacy of the Russian election it would be suggesting that the 87% of votes cast for Putin were illegitimate, something he said would be ridiculous.
""This is absurd,"" Peskov said.
Asked about calls from some Russian opposition activists to declare the Russian election illegitimate, Peskov said that people such as Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, had lost touch with Russia.
""There are a lot of people who have completely broken away from their homeland. The Yulia Navalnaya that you mentioned is moving more and more into this camp of people,"" Peskov said.
He said such people ""lose their roots, ties with their homeland, lose understanding of their homeland and stop feeling the pulse of their country.""

3,"China's Xi congratulates Putin on win, set to develop their ties",Putin won a record post-Soviet landslide in Russia's election on Sunday,"Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated Vladimir Putin on winning another term as Russia's president and said China was set to maintain close communication with Russia to promote their partnership, according to Chinese state media.
Putin won a record post-Soviet landslide in Russia's election on Sunday, cementing his tight grip on power in a victory he said showed Moscow had been right to stand up to the West and send its troops into Ukraine.
""Your re-election is a full demonstration of the support of the Russian people for you,"" Xi said, according to Xinhua News. ""I believe that under your leadership, Russia will certainly be able to achieve greater achievements in national development and construction.""
China has strengthened its ties with Russia over the past few years, even as Western criticism of the war in Ukraine has intensified.
The two countries declared a ""no limits"" partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two.
""China attaches great importance to the development of China-Russia relations and stands ready to maintain close communication with Russia to promote the sustained, healthy, stable and in-depth development of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership,"" Xi said, according to Xinhua.
It has been reported, China and Russia are preparing ""several meetings"" between Xi and Putin this year.
This year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, adding that the two heads of state would continue to maintain close exchanges

To express solidarity with the female prisoners in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail where she was once incarcerated, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Sunday had Iftar (broke her fast) with them.
Maryam also planted a tree in the lawn of the jail. She directed the prison authorities to plant more trees.
The Punjab chief minister also visited the cell where her father, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, was imprisoned during his time in jail.
She inaugurated a dedicated 20-bed hospital for the rehabilitation of drug addicts and a video call facility for prisoners in Kot Lakhpat jail.

She visited the jail kitchen and inspected the food prepared for the prisoners and checked its quality.
Maryam also interacted with the prisoners, inquiring about their problems and requirements.
On the Punjab CM’s instructions, the female inmates were given monetary assistance of Rs15,000, clothes and bangles.
Similarly, the male prisoners were provided with Rs15,000 and clothes.
The iftar menu was prepared according to Maryam’s instructions. It included biryani, fruit, pakoras, samosas, and other items.
In a post on social media platform X, Maryam shared that it was an emotional moment to see the cell of her father, a three-time former premier, was kept in.
“I was in the same jail but never allowed to visit him. Got to see it today,” she added.
The Punjab CM continued that by the grace of the Almighty, her father was a “kingmaker” today while the “oppressors” were nowhere.
In another post, she wrote that a video call facility for prisoners at Kot Lakhpat jail had become operational from today.
“Two calls a week, 20 [minutes] duration each would allow them more interaction with their families as opposed to one weekly meeting that seldom happened due to difficult family situations,” she added.

6,ECP issues Form 52 for those vying for Senate slots,"Two candidates each of the PML-N, SIC for Islamabad seats named in document"," 
The Election Commission of Pakistan has issued the Form 52 for those who had submitted their nomination papers for the Senate elections slated for April 2.
The details of candidates for two general and two technocrat seats from Islamabad have been released.
The names issued for the general seats from Islamabad are PML-N’s Rana Mehmood-ul-Hassan and Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) Farzand Hussain Shah.
For the technocrat seats from Islamabad, the names include PML-N’s Ishaq Dar and SIC’s Raja Ansar Mehmood Gilani.
The PML-N and PPP had reached a seat-adjustment agreement for the two Senate seats from Islamabad.
A total of 52 seats in the upper house of parliament will become vacant, but elections will only be held for 48 senators.
The reduction is because of the abolition of four reserved seats for the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) following the 25th Constitutional Amendment that merged them with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
The members of the National Assembly will elect one general seat and one technocrat seat (including Ulema) from the federal capital.

7,APTMA wants gas market deregulation,Millers response comes in wake of SSGC seeking further hike in prices," 
As the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) seeks a higher increase in prices, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) South region has called for market deregulation.
The association has called for shifting away from the model of guaranteed rates of return to open the gas market for competitive rates.
The SSGC is seeking a Rs274.40 per mmbtu increase in gas prices—effective from July 1 this year—to meet the revenue requirement of Rs359 billion.
The company is seeking a sum of Rs25 billion on account of return on assets.
However, the textile millers have submitted an intervention in response to the petition filed by SSGC that sought an increase in gas prices for the year 2024-25.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) will hold a public hearing on Monday (today) to consider the hike in gas prices for SSGC consumers.
In their response submitted to Ogra, the textile millers have called for market liberation and deregulation to foster competition and innovation in the gas sector, allowing new players to enter the market to promoting efficiency.
They also called for shifting away from the guaranteed rates of return model, tying asset expansion and investment decisions to economic viability as well as market dynamics.
“If the market is not fully liberalised and deregulated, then Suis will be left with heavily subsidised and low-revenue sectors,” the textile millers wrote in their response, adding that the federal government’s administrative consumer pricing system and gas allocation policy contributed to misallocation and inefficient use of the resource. They continued that the current system and policy granted undue discretionary power, presenting opportunities for exploitation.
Gas prices have hiked again to Rs2,750 per mmbtu—an increase of 223% since January 2023. The grid electricity tariffs are around 17.5 cents per kWh and increasing with no end in sight.
As such, there is no financially viable source of energy for firms to manufacture with and compete in the international markets.

“[The] tariffs are highest in the region,” the textile millers said.  They added that high tariffs were a risk to national security as they hindered industrial growth, reduced competitiveness, increased import and contributed to dependence on aid or debt.
Gas pricing is an entry barrier to other energy resources.
The RLNG is six to seven, LPG is 10, and electricity is 30 times high.
There is a 12% decline in the SGGC system intake. However, heavily cross-subsidised residential demand is increasing.
The textile millers also called for revising the protected consumer policy to ensure it was targeted and sustainable, protecting the gas company’s revenues and eliminating price distortions.
They maintained that gas outages during winters because of load profiling led to affluent consumers falling into the protected category.
The millers also called for transitioning from tariff subsidies to direct cash for deserving households under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
They further called for promoting the use of the alternative LPG, RLNG, and solar photovoltaic (PV) material in the domestic sector.
The association said net-metered households with solar PV installations should disconnect from piped natural gas (PNG) and rely solely on the electricity grid to mitigate the issue of cost-shifting. It noted that grid maintenance costs were passed on to non-solar consumers, including industries.
Natural gas pricing is not based on economic principles that lead to distortions, inflated demand, inefficient use, and circular debt.
Indigenous gas production is declining because of maturing fields and a lack of new discoveries and projected to experience a depletion of 12% in FY 2024-25, with a decrease to 718 mmcfd from 814 mmcfd in the previous year.
The gas distribution network, averaging over 35 years old, is coupled with theft, especially in Balochistan.
The SSGC confronts an Unaccounted for Gas (UFG) rate of 12% in natural gas and 14.36% in RLNG, significantly exceeding global benchmarks, indicative of systemic technical challenges, governance, political, cultural, and socioeconomic issues.
The association pointed out that sky-high energy tariffs were triggering deindustrialisation.
It continued that energy-intensive sectors including textiles were at a crucial juncture.
“The approach of cross-subsidising natural gas and electricity for the residential sector at the expense of industries in Pakistan is akin to addressing a weight loss issue by amputating a limb instead of reducing body fat—both drastic and misguided,” the response read.
The association was of the view that to maintain optimal tariffs, the federal government should peg industrial tariffs to Ogra’s prescribed price, setting it as a benchmark.
This would insulate the tariffs from power sector inefficiencies.
The millers said textile manufacturing units required gas for captive generation and process use for hot water, steam, etc.

8,President orders equal tax benefits for manual filers,"Warns FBR that FTO has lawful powers under law to direct the agency to take steps to avert, rectify maladministration"," 
The president has mandated that manual filers of income tax returns will now enjoy the same tax benefits as those filing electronically, while issuing a warning to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) regarding maladministration and highlighting the federal tax ombudsman’s authority to intervene under the FTO Ordinance, 2000.
The decision came following the rejection of an appeal filed by the FBR against an order of the FTO, wherein the president emphasised the obligation of statutory bodies to operate within the bounds of the law. There is thus no valid justification to interfere with the order of the FTO.
Sources revealed that the initiative was prompted by Lahore-based tax lawyer, Waheed Shahzad Butt, who brought attention to the discrimination faced by manual filers before the FBR and FTO.
Waheed Butt’s efforts culminated in consultations between FTO officials and FBR executives, leading to the resolution of the issue without resorting to costly litigation.
Waheed Butt further emphasised that Dr Asif Jah, the FTO, has mandated the FBR to implement specific mechanisms and establish Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure the activation of all manual filers’ income tax returns for the latest tax year, in accordance with the Active Taxpayers List (ATL) issued by the FBR.
Despite the FBR’s obligation to ensure fair and equitable taxation for all citizens, it has been revealed that manual filers of tax returns have been subjected to unlawful discrimination compared to electronically filed returns.
This failure to address the specific needs of this segment of the taxpayers has elicited sharp criticism from various quarters. A categorical written intimation/information regarding the violation of Rule 73 of Income Tax Rules 2002 by the FBR and the illegal exclusion of some taxpayers from the ATL database, was moved but all in vain.
The FBR, in direct violation of Rule 73, has deemed/ treated the manually filed income tax return as “inactive,” despite it being filed within the time specified by law, Butt added.
He said that the FBR should implement substantial measures to rectify these shortcomings and issues. This would benefit the general public and other individuals or taxpayers who experience such injustices, even though they have filed their returns.
“The recommendations of the FTO to adopt some mechanism and put in place an SOP to ensure that all filers of returns for the latest tax year are active as per ATL issued by the board are unassailable.” the president ordered that the representation was liable to be rejected with these observations.

9,PML-N picks Sindhu for Senate polls,Punjab minister told to submit papers for minorities seat,"The PML-N has nominated Provincial Parliamentary Affairs and Human Rights Minister Khalil Tahir Sindhu for the seat reserved for minorities in the Senate from Punjab for the upper house polls slated for April 2.
Sindhu was directed by the party leadership to submit his nomination papers for the Senate seat at the closing hours on Saturday.
He has been issued a party ticket to run for the Senate seat. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is also the president of the PML-N, congratulated him for receiving the ticket.
The PML-N did not give the ticket for the seat for minorities to former senator Kamran Michael this time.
Michael has served as a PML-N senator on a seat for minorities from 2012 to 2024.
Former PML-N senators Mushahid Hussain Sayed and Dr Asif Kirmani were also not given Senate tickets this time as well.
Other prominent PML-N leader who have been ignored for the Senate polls include  Khawaja Saad Rafique, Rana Sanaullah, Khurram Dastgir and Javed Latif.
A PML-N insider told The Express Tribune that there was much resentment within the party for choosing “outsiders” over loyalists for the Senate seats.
However, Sindhu is certainly no outsider. Sindhu, who is currently serving as a provincial minister, has remained a member of the Punjab Assembly from 2008 to 2024.
During this period, he has held the provincial portfolios of health, minority affairs, finance, parliamentary affairs and human rights.
He was also the PML-N chief whip in the previous Punjab Assembly.
