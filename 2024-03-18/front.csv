0,Pakistan targets TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan,FO says airstrikes hit Hafiz Gul Bahadur group,"Accusing certain elements in the Taliban government for patronising the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates, Pakistan carried out what it termed ""intelligence-based anti-terrorist operations"" in the border regions inside Afghanistan on Monday, in a significant escalation in tensions between the two neighbours.
But a carefully worded statement did not specify the nature of operation or mention the air strikes.
Although, Pakistan did carry out air strikes in the past inside Afghanistan, notably in April 2022, this was the first time Islamabad officially acknowledged striking inside the neighbouring country.
The strikes were prompted by March 16 terrorist attack in Mir Ali, North Waziristan in which seven Pakistani soldiers including two officers were martyred. The attack seems to be a tipping point in the relationship that has remained on the edge for months.
A statement issued by the foreign office said target of the operation was the terrorists belonging to Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, which along with Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was responsible for multiple terrorist attacks inside Pakistan, resulting in deaths of hundreds of civilians and law enforcement officials.
""The latest attack took place on 16 March 2024 at a security post in Mir Ali in North Waziristan and claimed the lives of seven Pakistani soldiers,"" it added.
The statement explained as to why Pakistan was compelled to take that extreme step.
""Over the past two years, Pakistan has repeatedly conveyed its serious concerns to the Interim Afghan Government over the presence of terror outfits including TTP inside Afghanistan. These terrorists pose a grave threat to Pakistan’s security and have consistently used Afghan territory to launch terror attacks inside Pakistani territory,"" said the foreign office.
It said Pakistan accords prime importance to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.
""It has, therefore, always prioritised dialogue and cooperation to confront the terrorist threat. We have repeatedly urged the Afghan authorities to take concrete and effective action to ensure that the Afghan soil is not used as a staging ground for terrorism against Pakistan. We have also called on them to deny safe havens to TTP and to hand over its leadership to Pakistan.""
The statement said while Pakistan has great respect for the people of Afghanistan but alleged that certain elements among those in power in Afghanistan were actively patronising TTP and using them as a proxy against Pakistan.
""Such an approach against a brotherly country, which stood with the people of Afghanistan through thick and thin, manifests shortsightedness. It ignores the support extended by Pakistan to the people of Afghanistan over the last several decades,"" it said.
""We urge these elements in power to rethink the policy of siding with Khwarij terrorists shedding the blood of innocent Pakistanis and to make a clear choice to stand with the people of Pakistan,"" it demanded.
The statement said terrorist groups like TTP are a collective threat to regional peace and security.
""We fully realise the challenge Afghan authorities face in combating the threat posed by TTP. Pakistan would therefore continue to work towards finding joint solutions in countering terrorism and to prevent any terrorist organization from sabotaging bilateral relations with Afghanistan,"" the statement concluded.
The Taliban government confirmed the strikes but rejected Pakistani claims that those attacks killed any militants.
Condemning the strikes as a violation of sovereignty, Zabiullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesperson, claimed attacks killed five women and three children in the eastern border provinces of Khost and Paktika.
""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan does not allow anyone to compromise security by using Afghan territory,"" Mujahid said in a statement.

“Last night at around 3am, Pakistani planes bombed the houses of civilians,” said the IEA spokesperson. He added that the bombings resulted in the deaths of six civilians, including three women and three children in Paktika, with an additional two women losing their lives due to the collapse of a house in Khost province.
The Paktika province is located near Pakistan’s South Waziristan district while Khost is situated near North Waziristan. ""The person named Abdullah Shah, who the Pakistani side claims was targeted in the incident, is in Pakistan, on the other hand, there is a tribe living on both sides of this region who have daily trips and close relationships,"" claimed Mujahid.
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns these attacks and calls this reckless action a violation of Afghanistan's territory, said the Taliban spokesperson and warned that the interim government of Afghanistan, which has a ""long experience of freedom struggle against the superpowers of the world"", does not allow anyone to ""invade its territory"".
The spokesperson also urged the new government to stop the ""continuation"" of wrong policies which ""benefit others"" and spoil the relationship between the two nations.
Mujhahid warned of potentially dire consequences stemming from such incidents, cautioning that the repercussions could spiral beyond Pakistan's control, “Such incidents can have very bad consequences which will be out of Pakistan’s control,"" said the spokesperson.
Commander Niamt Khan, the TTP Karachi senior military operational Commander, also eliminated in the earlier stages of the strikes, in Birmal. The TTP yet to confirm his death.
Eight civilians were killed Monday in ""reckless"" air strikes by Pakistan's military in the border regions of Afghanistan, prompting Afghan forces to retaliate against Pakistani military outposts, Taliban officials said.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistani aircraft ""bombed civilian homes"" in Khost and Paktika provinces near the border with Pakistan at around 3:00 am (2230 GMT Sunday), adding that all of the dead were women and children.
Afghanistan's defence ministry said its border forces retaliated in response to the airstrikes, targeting Pakistan's military posts along the disputed border with ""heavy weapons"".
Cross-border skirmishes in the region were reported by both sides on Monday, the latest in a string of incidents on the disputed frontier.
Malak Noor Khan, a tribal elder in the Sperah district of Khost, said he saw at least four explosives dropped from drones and jets and that multiple homes were destroyed, one with a woman and her children inside.
""When the drone came first, we all, including women and children, left our homes and went into the trees on the mountainside, it was very cold as there was snow on the ground,"" he told AFP.
A local government official in Pakistan's border regions, who asked not to be identified, told AFP residents had been instructed to evacuate the area during the skirmishes.
A senior government official based in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, who asked not to be identified, told AFP that, despite repeated complaints, ""Afghanistan does not seem to be taking the matter seriously"".
The Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement posted on X it had summoned the head of the Pakistani embassy in Kabul to protest against Monday's strikes.
It called on Pakistan's new government to ""not allow some circles to complicate the relationship between two neighbouring Muslim countries"" -- an apparent reference to certain Pakistani military leaders.

1,Can Shehbaz-Gandapur meeting mend broken trust?,Experts say both PML-N and PTI reluctant to take decisions independently," 
A recent meeting between the prime minister and the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) chief minister rekindled the hopes that a bitter rivalry between the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) could finally lead to reconciliation but the experts see little hope in this regard due to the lack of independent decision making in these parties.
Last week, the ice-breaking development came as K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who belongs to the PTI, held a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif – also the president of the PML-N -- and asked him to politically engage with his party’s founder Imran Khan, besides discussing other matters.
Though, the experts wish to see the political elite sitting across the table, instead of quarrelling with each other for tiny gains, they feel that the political parties seem to rely more on the powerful stakeholders than anything else.
“The real situation is somewhat more complex,” Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said, “some political parties don’t take independent decisions as the dependency culture is chronic.”
Apparently, the Pildat chief was referring to the parties’ habit of waiting for the powerful stakeholders’ signal before they take a step, whether inside or outside the parliament. Time and again, the political parties vow to reduce powerful quarters’ role in the political domain but usually end up seeking their support for moving ahead.
The Pildat chief, who keenly monitors the parliamentary proceedings and keeps an eye on the political developments, noted that for regaining the broken trust, the parties and institutions would require some time to show their genuine interest in settling things. “Even if the party leaders and institutions are willing to reconcile,” Mehboob said, “some cooling off period is required.”
Agreeing that a lack of independent decision making was evident in the political parties, Prof Tahir Naeem Malik of the NUML University said that the Shehbaz-Gandapur interaction could prove to be a thaw in political tensions.
As the office of the chief minister required a constant contact with the prime minister and other federal forums and constitutional bodies, the professor noted, regular contacts could lead to reducing the “heat between the two” sides.
Noting that optics like Shehbaz-Gandapur meeting, followed by a joined press talk by Gandapur and PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal, could frustrate PTI supporters, Prof Malik said maintaining a working relationship was needed by the PTI.
The PTI, he added, had to simultaneously govern a province and continue opposition of the ruling alliance at the Canter. “It is time to abandon the polarisation and anarchic model; its dividends would be for all,” he said.
When asked if the political temperature could go down in the coming days, Malik replied that currently things were not at the “not-negotiable” stage. He said they could reconcile but the onus of taking things forward was more on the government side than the PTI. “The ruling alliance should engage the PTI now after Shehbaz-Gandapur interaction,” he said.
Soon after the Shehbaz-Gandapur contact, President Asif Zardari had lauded the meeting, saying that it was time to begin the process of healing divisions, restoring confidence in democracy and keeping Pakistan above all. He also called for curbing polarisation and “political sectarianism”.
Even before Shehbaz-Gandapur meeting, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had also pointed out that no matter how many resolutions were passed to stop powerful quarters’ interference in the democratic system, the results could not be achieved until politicians start respecting one another and operate within their constitutional domain.
“We should not expect the judiciary and other institutions to work within their constitutional boundaries if we do not respect them ourselves,” he had said on the floor of the National Assembly on the heels of a speech by PkMAP’s chief Mahmood Achakzai’s suggestion that a resolution should be passed to limit interference in the political arena.

2,Govt tightens purse strings on official trips,"Ministers, parliamentarians barred from foreign trips using govt funds without prior approval","In a bid to tighten its belt, the federal cabinet has introduced stringent measures restricting foreign trips funded by the government, seeking to tighten purse strings on jet-setting.
The decision, issued by the Cabinet Division, comes as part of broader austerity policies aimed at curbing unnecessary expenditures. The measures are aimed at promoting fiscal responsibility and optimising governmental resources in the face of economic challenges.
Under the new directives, federal ministers, parliamentarians, and government officials are barred from undertaking foreign trips using government funds without prior approval.
Official visits of federal ministers, ministers of state, advisers, and assistants now require explicit authorisation from the Prime Minister's Office. However, simultaneous travel of both ministers and their deputies may be permitted under exceptional circumstances, subject to prime ministerial consent.
Similarly, a significant aspect of the austerity policy is the ban on luxury accommodation during official foreign visits. Government officials are instructed to opt for cost-effective alternatives such as teleconferencing whenever feasible.
Furthermore, senior officers of 20th grade or above, as well as deputation teams of three members, must seek clearance from the relevant minister before planning any overseas travel.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been designated as the central authority for monitoring and oversight of all foreign trips. All details regarding such visits must be promptly submitted to the ministry within 15 days of return, according to the directives.
In addition, a strict prohibition has been placed on contacts with countries lacking diplomatic ties with Pakistan.

Exceptions to the austerity measures include exemptions for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce.
Moreover, high-ranking officials such as the president and the chief justice of Pakistan are entitled to first-class travel accommodations.
In terms of travel class, distinctions have been made based on the official hierarchy. While the prime minister, chairman of the Senate, and speaker of the National Assembly are authorised to travel business class, the foreign minister, federal ministers, and ministers of state are also accorded similar privileges.
To ensure legislative efficiency, cabinet members are advised to refrain from foreign and domestic travel during National Assembly and Senate sessions.
Meanwhile, the Speaker of the National Assembly also opted to embrace austerity measures in alignment with the government's policy.
Sources within the National Assembly revealed that over 40 employees previously stationed at the Speaker House have been reassigned to duties within the National Assembly.
Speaking on the matter, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said there has been a reduction in staff for leaner operations.
In addition, he also stressed the need to decrease the number of security vehicles.
The NA speaker has returned six security vehicles and requested a comprehensive breakdown of all expenses incurred by the Speaker House and office throughout the current fiscal year.
