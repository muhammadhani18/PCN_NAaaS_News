0,Qaiser hints at grand alliance against ‘rigging’,"PTI leader says party will talk to Jamaat-e-Islami, others whose ‘mandate was stolen’"," 
PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser on Thursday said a grand alliance of political parties would be formed against election “rigging”.
Talking to the media outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, Qaiser noted that the PTI would talk with all the parties, whose mandate had been stolen including the Jamaat-e-Islami for the grand alliance, and conduct a campaign in an organised manner. “It is a pity that there is no state here.”
He maintained that those who had succeeded in the elections as per the “original” Forms-45 should have the right to form their government.
“You don’t have the power to form the government and cabinet,” he added while addressing the PML-N led coalition. He regretted that the prison administration did not allow him to meet with PTI founding chairman Imran Khan.
Conceding that his party’s MPAs were sworn in by the governor, he said it was a constitutional requirement.
“The present [federal] cabinet was administered oath by [President] Dr Arif Alvi,” he added, referring to the fact that the head of state belonged to his party.
In a related development, a PTI spokesperson demanded a thorough and impartial audit of the results of the “most rigged” elections in light of the assessment report of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) so as to take the people’s mandate back from the “thieves” and return it to their “rightful representatives”.
In a statement, the PTI spokesperson pointed out that after the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) and Pattan Development Organisation, Pildat in its report “Assessment of the Quality of General Election 2024” raised alarming questions about the transparency, fairness and credibility of the polls and pressed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to answer them.
He stated that the Pildat assessment report showed that the fairness score of the 2024 general elections plummeted to its lowest level since 2013, which was enough to prove the status of the “fake” government based on “rejected” characters.
He added that the Pildat assessment report was an endorsement of the “criminal” role of the electoral watchdog in stealing the public’s mandate through large-scale election “rigging” across the country.
He went on to say that all the factors ranging from delay in the election schedule to the suspension of cellular and internet services across the country on the polling day established that this year’s elections were the least fair ones in the past decade.
The PTI spokesperson recalled that the nefarious scheme of converting the majority into a minority through election “robbery” in the dark of the night by trampling results had already been “unmasked” by the former Rawalpindi commissioner.
He stated that the tampered Forms-45 published by the ECP on its website well after the stipulated time in sheer violation of the Election Act further exposed the “dirty plot” of results “tampering” before the entire nation.
The PTI spokesperson said that an “unconstitutional” government established on a “stolen” mandate neither had the ability, nor the capacity to take tough and solid decisions for the welfare of the nation.
He continued that after depriving the PTI of the seats it won convincingly, the plan to distribute the reserved seats of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) among other political parties would further create political instability and chaos in the country.

2,IMF steers clear of electoral tangle,Spokesperson says global lender does not comment on domestic political developments in response to PTI’s letter,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) bid to block the next multi-billion-dollar bailout package boomeranged on Friday as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) refused to wade into Pakistan's political waters.
However, the global lender urged the country to ensure a fair resolution of all electoral disputes.While breaking its silence on the PTI’s attempt to involve the global lender in political matters, a spokesperson of the IMF instead showed readiness to negotiate the next medium-term programme with the new elected government.
“The IMF, as an international institution with a narrow mandate on economic issues, does not comment on domestic political developments,” said the IMF spokesperson while commenting on the letter written by the PTI.The IMF said that it received a letter from a PTI spokesperson on February 28 regarding the Fund’s engagement with Pakistan under the programme.
The PTI has been disputing the February 8 election results, claiming to have won about 177 seats as against 92, which were notified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) as independently elected members of the National Assembly.The PIT has also claimed to have documentary evidence of rigging in the elections and demanded that the IMF should play a role in conducting the investigations.
“Given the importance of the institutional environment for economic stability and growth, we do encourage the fair and peaceful resolution of all electoral disputes”, said the IMF spokesperson.
The PTI’s decision to write the letter to the IMF was also against the party’s vocal opposition to the involvement of any foreign player in Pakistan’s political matters.The attempt to involve the IMF in domestic political affairs had also given credence to the apprehensions that former prime minister Imran Khan may resort to any extent to win back the power that he had lost because of a vote of no confidence in April 2022.
The IMF’s current $3 billion short-term bailout package is expiring before the middle of next month and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has already given the go-ahead to the ministry of finance to begin discussions for signing a new Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
The last EFF had expired in June without the disbursement of the $2.6 billion loan amount due to Pakistan’s failure to meet the programme conditions.The last loan tranche of $1.2 billion of the current programme remains undisbursed and the IMF is waiting for the formation of the federal cabinet before sending a mission to Pakistan.

“We look forward to engaging with the new government to complete the second review under the current Stand-by Arrangement and, should the government request, support the formulation of a new medium-term economic programme,” according to the IMF spokesperson.
PM Sharif has not yet officially announced the new economic czar of Pakistan, although there has been an in-principle agreement to make Muhammad Aurangzeb as the in-charge of the finance ministry.
Aurangzeb is not a Pakistani national. If he decides to surrender his foreign nationality, he would be made a senator from Punjab and the finance minister. In case he retains his foreign nationality, Aurangzeb would be the special assistant to the PM.
The IMF also laid out its priorities for future engagements with Pakistan, as the country remains dependent on international financial institutions to meet its annual $25 billion to $30 billion foreign financing needs for debt repayments and current account deficit financing.
The spokesperson said that the IMF’s aim is to support the implementation of strong policies to deepen financial stability, address long-standing economic and underlying balance of payments challenges, and restore sustained and inclusive growth for the benefit of all Pakistani citizens.
The spokesperson further elaborated that to achieve these objectives there is a need for Pakistan to ensure stronger public finances, through high-quality revenue measures to broaden the tax base while scaling up the support for the most vulnerable.The IMF is again pushing Pakistan to increase the tax burden of the salaried and the business individuals by reducing the number of tax slabs –a move that would be highly counterproductive and could create unease among the salaried persons.
The federal government’s expenditure shot up 50% to Rs7.5 trillion during the first seven months of this fiscal year, mainly because of high-interest rates that are now eating up nearly two-thirds of the total expenses.The spokesperson also highlighted restoring energy sector viability, improving institutional governance and anti-corruption effectiveness, State-Owned Enterprises reforms, building climate resilience, and creating a level playing field for private businesses to promote investment and job creation as its other priorities.
Despite the involvement of the IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan has remained unable to resolve its energy sector issues due to long policy prescriptions. The fiscalisation of the energy sector losses is not helping to zero the circular debt, which now stands close to Rs5.7 trillion for both the gas and the power sectors.
The IMF had also included the anti-corruption theme in its last EFF programme but the global lender did not actively follow this agenda.
