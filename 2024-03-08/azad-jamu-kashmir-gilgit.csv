3,AMTI BoG lock horns over chairperson’s resignation,Rival group claims current head lacks mandate to run affairs,"The Ayub Medical Teaching Institution (AMTI)’s Board of Governors (BoG) are at loggerheads over a dispute rising from the acceptance of its chairman Mushtaq Jadoon’s resignation and the reinstatement of two employees who were terminated a few years back.
While requesting anonymity, a senior manager of AMTI told The Express Tribune that the BoG has been divided into two groups, one of which is led by outgoing chairman, Mushtaq Jadoon, while the other group is represented by senior lawyers Asad Khan Jadoon, Fawad Saleh and Syed Jafar shah.
It has been learnt that the dispute arose after the delay of notification by the KP government over the acceptance of BoG chariman’s resignation. During this period, a controversial letter was issued by the section officer of health about the resignation of Mushtaq Jadoon. The chairman had tendered his resignation from his office on February 9, 2024, just after the 94th BoG meeting.
It was further understood that Mushtaq Jadoon, Dr Aftab Rabani and Ayaz Khan seem to be on one page as they argue that the chairman can continue to work till a notification of the acceptance of resignation has been given.
Whereas Asad Khan, Fawad Saleh and Syed Jafar Shah have a different stance. 
They claim that after resignation from his slot, the chairman has no authority to make any decisions alongside the BoG. They further argue that his resignation had already been accepted by the caretaker chief minister.
It was also learnt that another member, Javed Turk has been observed to be moving as a rolling stone.
