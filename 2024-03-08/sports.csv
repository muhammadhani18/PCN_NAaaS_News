2,Three shops gutted in market blaze,Fire turns goods worth millions of rupees into ashes,"Three shops were completely destroyed while four were partially damaged in a fire that broke out at a plastic and foam market, Iqbal Centre, near Jamia Cloth Market on MA Jinnah Road at around 9:30am on Tuesday. 
Police, Rangers, Fire Brigade, Sindh Emergency Rescue 1122, and officials from welfare organisations reached the spot. Due to the intensity of the flames, the fire brigade staff declared it a third-degree fire and called additional resources from other parts of the city. 
Traffic police swiftly closed the MA Jinnah Road and diverted the traffic to alternative routes during the morning rush hours.
The Fire Brigade and Sindh Emergency Rescue 1122 managed to douse the flames in about an hour, said Chief Fire Officer Ishtiaq Ahmed.
He said that the cash counter in one shop, containing money, was also destroyed. Ahmed said that the fire brigade responded to information, rushed to the site immediately and started the firefighting operation. 
This market had experienced a previous fire, resulting in the destruction of the entire market, prompting reinforcement calls from other stations. All 210 residential flats above the market were evacuated promptly.
The Chief Fire Officer mentioned that out of several hundred shops in the market, only three were completely burnt, while four were partially damaged. 
The fire brigade's timely response prevented further spread of the fire, which was primarily fueled by foam, resin, Samad bond, and other goods. 
A short circuit is suspected to be the cause of the fire, and a significant amount of foam was utilised to extinguish it. Fortunately, no casualty was reported in the incident. 
Rescue 1122 officer Iftikhar Ahmed reported that a fire alert was received at 9:50am, with response teams reaching the scene within ten to fifteen minutes. Upon arrival, the fire's intensity and smoke necessitated the use of special equipment to access and extinguish the flames. 
The affected shops primarily dealt with foam products, and it was noted that fire safety arrangements were lacking.
Senior Director KMC affirmed that all available resources were utilised to control the fire. An investigation has been initiated to determine the cause of the fire. He emphasised the absence of fire safety arrangements in the market, highlighting the need for improved safety measures.
