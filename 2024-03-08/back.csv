0,Five Pakistanis executed for murdering Bangladeshi guard in KSA,"Perpetrators were brought before a competent court, found guilty, and subsequently sentenced to death","Saudi Arabian authorities have carried out the execution of five Pakistani expatriates who were convicted of raiding a private company and causing the death of a security guard, as reported by Gulf News. According to the Saudi Interior Ministry, the convicted individuals attacked a private sector firm, where they tied up two guards and assaulted and killed a Bangladeshi security personnel.
Following thorough investigations, the five perpetrators were brought before a competent court, found guilty, and subsequently sentenced to death.
The verdict, upheld through the appeals and supreme courts, received final approval through a royal order, leading to the execution of the individuals on Tuesday in Makkah.
Saudi Arabia, known for its strict legal system, applies the death penalty for crimes such as murder, terror attacks, and drug smuggling.
This incident follows a recent execution in January, where four Ethiopian expatriates were executed for the murder of a Sudanese national, with the motive remaining undisclosed. In a separate case in December, two Bangladeshi expatriates faced execution for murdering an Indian man over a financial dispute, employing insecticide as their weapon.
The application of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia has drawn international attention and criticism, with human rights organisations frequently raising concerns about the transparency and fairness of the legal proceedings leading to such severe sentences.

1,No clue to 14 fishermen three days after boat capsized,"Pakistan Navy, MSA engaged in search and rescue operation","Despite three days of extensive search by the Maritime Security Agency (MSA) and the Fishermen’s Cooperative Society, there is still no sign of the 14 fishermen, who went missing after a fishing boat capsized in the Arabian Sea off the Thatta coast.
Coastal Media Centre spokesperson Kamal Shah said on Thursday that the boat, named Al Asad Ali, sank near Hijamara Creek because of strong winds three days ago. “The fishermen on board are still missing,” the spokesperson added.
Shah identified the missing fishermen as Riaz Bengali, Ahmed Bengali, Shakeel Bengali, Sajjad, Koki, Hashu, Riaz Ashraf, Noor Alam Bengali, Rahim Bengali, Sher Malah, Munir, Alam Kalam Bengali, Qayyum Behari, and Hasan Boro. “Two of them are siblings,” he added.
A Sea King helicopter of the Pakistan Navy and speedboats of the MSA were carrying out the search and rescue operations on Thursday, while another boat, named Al Abdullah, had been sent to Hijamara Creek to help in the operation.
Nasir Boniri, the security in-charge of the Fishermen’s Cooperative Society, stated that the families of the missing fishermen were worried for their loved ones. The families of the missing fishermen said no government officials visited them so far.
Talking to this correspondent in a dilapidated house in Ibrahim Hyderi, a fishing community on the edge of Karachi, the wife of a victim, Hashim, said that her husband was the sole breadwinner of the family, which included seven children. His elder brother said that Hashim had left for fishing four days ago.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari expressed deep concern over the boat tragedy and urged the authorities concerned to utilise all available resources for the rescue of the missing fishermen.
“I pray for the safe return of the missing fishermen to their homes,” Bilawal stated, according to a press release issued by the Bilawal House Media Cell. Emphasising the need for modernising the rescue operations for fishermen, Bilawal reiterated the PPP’s commitment to the protection of the fishermen.

3,Retiring senators call for restoring true democracy,Dar says reengage with US for Aafia’s return,"Senators, who would retire later this month after completing their six-year term in the upper house of parliament in their farewell speeches urged all political parties to adopt a unanimous strategy for restoring true democracy in the country.
In their speeches, the senators raised several issues, such as foreign policy matters, the Kashmir and Palestinian questions, provincial rights and continued incarceration of Pakistani scientist Dr Aafia Siddiqui in a jail in the United States.
Leader of the House, Ishaq Dar, highlighted the government’s plans to reengage with the US government to secure Dr Siddiqui’s return. “This issue will be a priority agenda of the new cabinet. Her sentence could be served in Pakistan,” Dar told the house.
Earlier, Senator Mushtaq Ahmad said that upon his return from a recent visit to the US, he had proposed four political options regarding Dr Siddiqui's repatriation. ""I intend to present a letter containing these four political options to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar,"" Ahmad said.
Ahmad of the Jamaat-e-Islami, asked the upper house to work for the rights of provinces as per Constitution. He urged political parties to bring democracy within their respective structures, and called for a dialogue to take country out of the current crises.
Senator Molvi Faiz Muhammad of the Jamiat-Ulema-e-Islam stressed the need for focusing on foreign policy. He lamented the silence of the Islamic countries on Kashmir and Palestine issues. He also called for pay attention to the issues of the people of Balochistan.
Senator Shaheen Khalid Butt, in his farewell speech, highlighted the issue of overseas Pakistanis and urged the government to resolve them. Sana Jamali urged the political parties to respect the national institutions, and fully support them for the development of country.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla said that the people of Pakistan had sent them to the parliament for the prosperity and development of the country but unfortunately many things had happened which went against the public and the country’s interest.
Senator Saifullah Abro said that political parties should never close doors for dialogue. “I assure this house on behalf of my party that we are ready to sit with all political parties but only if they concede special and reserve seats allotted to them by Election Commission of Pakistan,” he said.
Senator Azam Nazir Tarar stressed that listening to the viewpoints of other senators in the house was the essence of democracy. Senator Mohammad Akram said that during his tenure he raised the issue of missing persons and development of Balochistan but unfortunately failed to resolve those issues.

4,Country’s laws to curb human trafficking lauded,"EU, FIA reiterate joint commitment to combat money laundering","The European Union on Thursday appreciated the legislation introduced by Pakistan to combat human trafficking including the enactment of the two laws in 2018 -- Trafficking in Persons (TIP) and Smuggling of Migrants (SOM) Acts.
The EU and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) also reiterated their joint commitment to combat human trafficking and money laundering.
A EU delegation led by its international affairs head of unit Pawel Busiakiewicz visited the FIA headquarters in Islamabad and met with its director general Ahmad Ishaque Jehangir, immigration wing additional director general Ashraf Zubair Siddiqui, ,  Anti-Human Smuggling Director Israr Ahmed Khan, Counter-Terrorism Wing (CTW) Director Humayun Masood Sandhu, NCB-Interpol Director Malik Sikandar Hayat, and Immigration Director Abdul Qadir Qamar.
It highlighted the FIA’s cooperation efforts with the US Consulate, British High Commission, Australian High Commission, Interpol and EU.
The EU team also appreciated the FIA's partnership with international organisations and diplomatic missions. It also lauded Pakistan’s ratification of the UN’s Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.
On 6 September 2022, sustained advocacy on the issue over many years by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime led to the Pakistan’s cabinet issuing it approval for accession to the protocol.
The delegation also appreciated the efforts of FIA’s CTW to collaborate with international partners to combat cyber-terrorism and extremist narratives.
It also highlighted the FIA’s joint research initiatives, efforts to enhance cyber security, digital forensics training programmes and cooperation in investigations into terrorism financing. The Pakistan-EU Joint Working Group on Combating International Terrorism was highlighted as an important contributor to the global efforts in this connection.
Both sides reiterated conducting capacity building training on transnational organised crime including money laundering, terrorism financing and other financial crimes. Pakistan has legislated Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2010 and Mutual Legal Assistance Act of 2020. Both these laws have several preventive and internal controls to minimise the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing from Pakistan.
According to the foreign affairs ministry’s website, being a victim of terrorism, Pakistan attaches great significance to countering extremism and terrorism. Terrorism and extremism as a global phenomenon have affected almost every region in the world.
Terrorism not only infringes upon human rights, but also negatively impacts the economy. From 2001 to 2022, Pakistan suffered a large number of causalities and incurred huge economic losses. The human cost of terrorism is devastating; its economic impact is even higher. This does not include the long term losses to the economy in terms of indirect or secondary impact of terrorism.
Pakistan has taken several measures from time to time to successfully counter the menace of extremism and terrorism.

9,"Shehbaz, Zardari vow national revival",Allies formally endorse PPP co-chairman’s candidacy of president’s post,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the would-be president, Asif Ali Zardari, on Thursday promised to take challenges head on and to steer the country out of crises as the former endorsed the latter’s candidacy for the president’s position. The duo also pledged to work together.
Shehbaz has already become the prime minister for the second time while Zardari is just days away from entering the presidency–both returning to the key offices for the second time.
Amid rigging allegations and protest calls by rivals, the Shehbaz-Zardari duo on Thursday recounted the challenges being faced by the country and vowed that they would change Pakistan’s fate after taking the reins of the country together following the president’s election on March 9.
Even before winning the presidential elections, Zardari while assuring full support to PM Shehbaz tabled his plan of untapping China’s $5 trillion food-import market, saying fixing the agriculture sector was needed to get Pakistan a share from this market alone.
The pledges and endorsement came during a dinner reception hosted by PM Shehbaz for members of PML-N and its coalition partners at the Prime Minister House.
At the reception, Shehbaz, who is also the PML-N’s president, threw his weight behind Zardari together with the MQM-P, BAP, the IPP and the PML-Q.
Apart from the joint presidential candidate, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, MQM-P’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, PML-N’s Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Khawaja Asif, Khawaja Saad Rafique, PPPP’s Yousaf Raza Gilani, Raza Rabbani, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Khurshid Shah and IPP Aleem Khan and Awn Chaudhry as well as several other politicians attended the dinner.
The premier acknowledged that his government was facing immense challenges  on various fronts, particularly the economy. Shehbaz said he has been taking briefings since he took oath and the numbers are alarming.
The PM revealed that the gas and electricity circular debt has soared to Rs5 trillion while the debt of the PIA has ballooned to Rs825 billion. The annual electricity theft amounts to Rs500 billion, PM lamented, underscoring the gravity of the economic situation.
He also highlighted that the government had refunded Rs65 billion to exporters, stressing the need to expand the tax base while reducing the burden on those already taxed.
He pointed out that Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio was just 9.8%, whereas it was higher in other countries. Shehbaz also highlighted the losses of state-owned entities, losses that amount to hundreds of billions of rupees, and the government's reliance on loans to cover these losses.
During the reception, PM Shehbaz said that Rs1.7 billion in taxes were stuck in courts due to litigation.
""We must unite to lead Pakistan out of the present economic difficulties. If we fail, history will not forgive us,"" he remarked. “Our goal is to improve the nation's condition, and we must present our proposals to friendly countries to attract investment,” he said.

While expressing his gratitude to all those supporting him in the presidential elections, Zardari admitted that the challenges facing Pakistan are difficult but their solution is not impossible.
Zardari, while pointing out that China imports $5 trillion food, said that Pakistan could capture it by focusing on the agriculture sector as it has the potential to attract trillions of dollars. Equating Shehbaz with Einstein, Zardari said that “Einstein was not afraid of difficult challenges and Shehbaz Sharif is also not afraid of them either”.

Zardari pledged his support to Shehbaz, affirming his commitment to assist him at every level.
“Fix agriculture, fix canals and build dams, let us become a ‘force multiplier’ for China, all this is definitely difficult but not impossible, we will make Pakistan prosperous together,” he added.
On the occasion, Bilawal expressed gratitude to all the coalition parties and Shehbaz Sharif, emphasizing that Asif Ali Zardari would make history as the first civilian president of Pakistan to take office for a second term on Saturday.
""Zardari was the strongest president in the country’s history. We passed the 18th Amendment and transferred the powers to the prime minister, abolished 58-2(b) and gave this power to the prime minister,"" he added, saying he would nevertheless be a president like the Queen of England.
The PPP chairman expressed optimism that Zardari, once elected president, would unify the nation and resolve societal divisions, as he had done in the past, ultimately strengthening democracy through collaboration with all political parties.
""We must face Pakistan's challenges together, but we are optimistic about our success,"" Bilawal asserted. ""We will endeavour to secure victory for our joint candidate (Zardari) with the highest possible number of votes.""
