0,Moody’s boosts banking outlook,"Says solid profitability, supportive policies to bolster sector resilience","Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded Pakistan’s banking sector outlook to stable (Caa3) from negative, believing the financial institutions’ solid profitability and stable funding and liquidity provide an adequate buffer to withstand the country’s macroeconomic challenges and political turmoil.
The global rating agency maintained “economic and fiscal pressures are easing (on Pakistan)”, projecting the country’s economy would return to modest growth of 2% in the current fiscal year 2023-24 after contrasting 0.3% in the prior fiscal year 2022-23.
Besides, the country’s inflation reading is anticipated to reduce to a monthly average of 23% in FY24 compared to 29% in FY23, it added.
Recovery from the 2022 floods and low base effects will support a modest economic recovery in Pakistan, though challenging external conditions and tight monetary policy will keep growth below potential.
However, high-interest rates and inflation will continue to curb private-sector spending and investment. Furthermore, banks are financing the sovereign’s wide fiscal deficits, “leaving little space to lend to the real economy.”
Pakistani banks remain highly exposed to the government via large holdings of government securities that amount to around half of total banking assets, which links their credit strength to that of the sovereign.
Pakistani authorities have historically supported banks in difficulty, with no depositor losses recorded, and remain willing to do so given banks’ role as the main source of government financing. Deposit insurance of Rs500,000 per depositor covers about 94% of individual depositors and 15% of banks’ total deposits.
“However, the government’s capacity to provide support is constrained by the fiscal challenges that drive its Caa3 rating, which also constrains Pakistani banks’ deposit ratings at this level.”
Moody’s rates the five largest banks in Pakistan namely National Bank of Pakistan, Habib Bank Limited, Allied Bank Limited, United Bank Limited, and MCB Bank Limited. The five banks together account for 46% of system deposits, as of September 2023, and all have baseline credit assessments of Caa3. Islamic banking is evident in Pakistan, with a market share of only 19% of total banking assets as of December 2023.
Government securities account for 51% of Pakistani banks’ total assets and around nine times their equity, among the highest levels for Moody’s-rated banks globally. This exposure links banks’ credit profiles to that of the Caa3 Pakistani sovereign, for which concerns around debt restructuring persist, and banks will remain the main source of government financing over our outlook period.
The problem loans (non-performing loans/NPLs) ratio of the Pakistani banks Moody’s rate rose to 8.5% as of September 2023, up from 7.3% in December 2022, following severe shocks that subdued economic growth and as historically high inflation and interest rates erode borrowers’ repayment capacity. “We expect problem loans to stabilise at around 9% of gross loans, partly because of the banks’ reluctance to lend in this challenging environment (loan growth was flat in 2023). The expected introduction of IFRS 9 accounting standards in 2024 will likely increase provisioning needs.”
Moody’s expects Pakistani banks’ interest revenue – the largest contributor to operating income – to moderate in 2024, with monetary policy beginning to ease as inflation and interest rates gradually recede from 2023 peaks. However, NIMs (4.3% as of September 2023) will remain generally strong in 2024, driven by high investment income from government securities holdings, while banks optimize their cost of funds.
Subdued business and lending activity will keep interest on lending and non-interest income in check. Operating expenses will likely stabilise in line with easing inflation and banks’ cost-control efforts. Persistently elevated tax rates and potentially higher loan-loss provisions will weigh on banks’ bottom-line profitability, with the return on average assets hovering around 3%.
Deepening financial inclusion and remittances from non-resident Pakistanis are broadening domestic deposit inflows. Banks are mainly deposit-funded, with customer deposits accounting for 58% of total assets as of September 2023, and have very low reliance on more volatile market funding (5.6% of tangible assets as of December 2022) given limited access to international debt markets.
However, the cost of funds is rising moderately as high-interest rates have driven a migration to interest-bearing deposits from non-interest-bearing deposits, which were down to 74% of total system deposits as at end-2023 from 75.2% a year earlier.
The introduction of a Treasury Single Account – which requires government deposits to be held at the State Bank of Pakistan – will have only a modest impact on deposit outflows. Banks have sufficient liquidity buffers, with around 12% of assets held as cash and interbank placements and another 51% invested in government securities.
However, the global rating agency estimates that around 40% of banks’ government securities holdings are encumbered, placed as collateral with the central bank with the newly raised liquidity used to buy more government bonds. Pakistani banks have limited reliance on dollar funding and generally run matched currency positions.

1,"Nisab fixed at Rs135,179, up 31% from last year",People who have submitted zakat exemption affidavits are not liable to pay zakat on their bank balance,"The Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety has notified Rs135,179 as the Nisab of zakat – the minimum amount in bank accounts on which zakat will be deducted on the eve of first Ramazan, which will fall either on March 12 or 13, depending on the sighting of the moon.
Banks will deduct 2.5% of the total amount in their accounts as zakat. No deduction will be made at source in case the amount stands less than Rs135,179, according to a notification of the ministry posted on the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) website on Thursday.
The Nisab is higher by 31%, or Rs32,020, this year as compared to Rs103,159 last year, it has been learnt.
The first day of Ramazan has been notified as the “deduction date”, when zakat will be collected from banks’ saving accounts, profit and loss-sharing accounts and other similar accounts, according to the notification.
People who have submitted zakat exemption affidavits are not liable to pay zakat on their bank balance. Moreover, those people and corporations who are maintaining current accounts are also not liable to pay zakat through their bank accounts.

2,Fertiliser industry urges uniform gas tariff,"Engro CFO calls on govt to end discriminatory pricing, promote new investments","The discriminatory gas tariffs for fertiliser plants have caused a disparity in fertiliser prices, creating opportunities for middlemen to profit by Rs80 to Rs100 billion. Currently, Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) Bin Qasim costs Rs5,389 per sack, Engro Fertiliser is priced at Rs4,649, and Fuji Fertiliser stands at Rs3,767 per sack.
Engro Fertiliser, Chief Financial Officer, Ali Rathore stressed the government’s need to abolish the unequal gas prices among fertiliser plants to encourage new investments and ensure farmers have access to fertiliser. He noted that removing the gas subsidy is a necessary step, particularly for fertiliser manufacturers who constitute 60% of the industry’s capacity and operate under Sui Northern Gas Company (SNGC) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC). However, gas prices have surged nearly 200% for fertiliser plants under SSGC and SNGC, whereas those reliant on Mari gas still benefit from a reduced price of Rs580 per MMBtu. This disparate pricing has led to varying fertiliser prices in the market, providing middlemen with increased profit opportunities. A uniform gas price would level the playing field, stabilise urea prices, and ensure equitable input costs for all fertiliser manufacturers.
Rathore proposed that the government could gain an additional income of Rs 80 to 100 billion by ending the gas subsidy for fertiliser factories and implementing a unified gas tariff for the industry, thereby supporting agricultural development. He stressed the importance of long-term policies to promote sustainable economic growth and meet the goals of Green Initiative Pakistan.
The local fertiliser industry is committed to ensuring an abundant and affordable supply of urea, and locally-produced urea is still around 30% cheaper than imported urea. Additionally, the industry recently supported the government by obtaining approximately 220,000 tonnes of urea at import prices.
Despite being the fifth-largest consumer of urea globally, Pakistan lacks new investments to increase fertiliser production capacity, despite a rapidly growing population. Rathore underscored the urgency of encouraging further expansion in fertiliser manufacturing capacity and establishing consistent policies for determining gas prices in the industry.
Acknowledging the multibillion-dollar investments required for large-scale fertiliser plants, the Engro CFO stated that eliminating gas pricing anomalies would incentivise manufacturers to invest in modernising and expanding their facilities, thereby improving efficiency to maximise gas utilisation.
Furthermore, Engro Fertilisers and other major fertiliser manufacturers are investing heavily in the Gas Pressure Enhancement Facilities (PEF) project to maintain local urea production levels and ensure food security. Engro Fertilisers’ capital expenditure in this project is expected to exceed $100 million.

3,DG Customs for streamlining processes,"Efforts to reduce review time, improve communication aimed at boosting trade, economic growth","Director General (DG) Customs Valuation Karachi, Mirza Mubashir Baig, has said that Customs is addressing issues holistically, employing technology adoption as the primary tool to resolve grievances and complaints of the business community in a fair and transparent manner.
He mentioned that the department aims to reduce the review time gradually from 30 days and solicited the cooperation of traders to achieve this goal.
Regarding letters from the federal tax ombudsman (FTO), he noted that comments are required within one to two weeks, with 45 days allotted for resolution. He assured that all correspondence from the esteemed office of FTO receives prompt and careful consideration.
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce Industry (FPCCI), President, Atif Ikram Sheikh stated during the DG Customs Valuation’s visit to FPCCI in Karachi, that they agreed in principle to collaborate to reduce the review time from 30 days to as short as possible. This is crucial to facilitate the country’s trade and industrial production, which is essential for job creation, revenue generation, and economic growth.
He underscored the business community’s desire to see the review time for custom valuation reduced to seven days, which they intend to propose as part of FPCCI’s suggestions for the federal budget 2024–25.
Sheikh highlighted that fluctuations in custom valuation lead to volatility and uncertainty in industrial planning, production, and exports. Any delays in custom valuation result in unfair demurrages and detention charges for importers, causing financial losses that can be mitigated through improved communication between the customs department and the business community.
He also pointed out that technological advancements, particularly in digitalisation, have transformed shipping and customs practices globally, reducing the need for upfront payments. He urged the customs department to address liquidity blockages faced by the business community, especially in times when access to finance is severely restricted in Pakistan due to the 22% key policy rate.

4,Rupee breaks five-day losing streak,"Gold reaches new six-month peak at Rs228,150 per tola","Pakistani currency on Thursday appreciated Rs0.07 to Rs279.28 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market, ending a five-day losing streak, though the central bank reported that its foreign currency reserves had shrunk to $7.89 billion.
On the other hand, gold hit a new six-month high at Rs228,150 per tola (11.66 grams) in a rally fuelled by the record high reached in the global metals market for the second consecutive day.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee ticked up to Rs279.28 against the greenback compared to Wednesday’s close at Rs279.35/$.
Taking cue from the inter-bank market, the currency gained Rs0.26 to Rs281.74/$ in the open market.
The recovery in the two markets came after the government geared up to hold talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new loan programme of around $6-8 billion after completion of the ongoing $3 billion standby arrangement in April 2024.
However, the foreign exchange reserves, held by the SBP, decreased $54 million to over two-month low at $7.89 billion in the week ended March 1, 2024, according to the latest weekly update released on Thursday. The forex reserves dropped “due to debt repayment”, the SBP said.
However, the foreign currency reserves held by commercial banks edged up to $5.12 billion compared to $5.08 billion a week ago.
Accordingly, the country’s total liquid reserves stood at $13.02 billion in the week under review compared to $13.03 billion in the prior week.
The gold price surged Rs2,750 on Thursday to a new six-month high at Rs228,150 in the wake of an increase of $26 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market to a new record high at $2,174, according to the All Pakistan Saraf Gems and Jewellers Association.
Association member Abdullah Abdul Razzak said Israeli aggression on Palestinian civilians had continued to worsen the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. “This uncertainty forced global investors to park their savings in gold, which is termed a safe-haven asset,” he said.

5,Stocks post thin losses on economic fears,"KSE-100 index sheds 53.53 points, settles at 65,603.09","Pakistan Stock Exchange on Thursday endured highly volatile trading and closed slightly lower over investor concerns about economic recovery and their cautious stance ahead of monetary policy announcement in mid-March.
Earlier, trading began with a jump in the KSE-100 index, which touched its intra-day high of 65,874.15 points but soon volatility prevailed, restricting the market from posting further gains.
Investors adopted a wait-and-watch stance over economic uncertainty and ahead of the release of monetary policy by the State Bank on March 18.
Additionally, investors’ interest was undermined by pressure from the falling foreign currency reserves and concerns over IMF’s new conditions for taxation and power sector reforms for a long-term bailout package.
The lack of major positive developments kept the index in negative zone for most the day where selling pressure and profit-booking eroded all the gains. Moody’s upgrading of Pakistan’s banking sector outlook to stable from negative gave a little bit of boost to the bourse, helping it recover and close with marginal losses. 
“Stocks closed lower on economic uncertainty,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti. “Oil sector outperformed on strong financials and the revised refinery policy that supported plant upgrades,” he said.
“Uncertainty over the monetary policy announcement, weak rupee due to falling forex reserves and concerns over the IMF’s new terms for higher taxes and power tariff reforms before a long-term bailout played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the PSX,” he added.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a slight decrease of 53.53 points, or 0.08%, and settled at 65,603.09.
Topline Securities, in its report, said that the KSE-100 saw a volatile session. “On the political front, newly elected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged to resolve the country’s crisis, with expectations that his cabinet members would be finalised within the next 48 hours,” it said.
In the cement sector, DG Khan Cement (+1.29%), Pioneer Cement (+0.92%) and Kohat Cement (+2.16%) closed positive, driven by the drop of $100 per ton in international coal prices, Topline said. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that the “support zone at 65,000-65,500 was tested before closing above 65,600”. “Moody’s upgraded its outlook on Pakistan’s banking sector to stable from negative. Their baseline credit assessment is ‘Caa3’ for the largest five banks – NBP, Habib Bank, United Bank, MCB Bank and Allied Bank,” it said.
Moody’s forecast that Pakistan’s economy would return to a modest growth of 2% in 2024 after subdued activity in 2023 while inflation would fall to around 23% from 29% last year.
Following the recent consolidation around 66,000 and test of the near-term support, “the KSE-100 is now set to take out 66,000 in the coming sessions and advance towards new all-time highs”, AHL added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 354.2 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 419.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs14.4 billion.
Shares of 354 companies were traded. Of these, 145 stocks closed higher, 187 dropped and 22 remained unchanged.
Pak Elektron was the volume leader with trading in 31.1 million  shares, gaining Rs1.61 to close at Rs23.24. It was followed by Telecard Limited with 22.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.09 to close at Rs8.57 and Pakistan International Airlines with 21.6 million shares, gaining Rs1.09 to close at Rs15.60.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs974.6 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,Hutchison invests in tech upgrade,Remote-controlled cranes set to elevate Karachi terminal efficiency,"Hutchison Ports Pakistan has invested over $600 million, including $235 million solely in state-of-the-art equipment, to introduce remote-controlled cranes and enhance efficiency and productivity, according to senior officials.
In a discussion with journalists on Thursday, they shared that the terminal, which has a designed capacity of 3.1 million TEUs (Twenty Feet Equivalent Units) annually, managed to handle 1 million TEUs during 2023. The terminal has been operational since 2017 under a concession agreement with the Karachi Port Trust (KPT).
“We are conducting our quayside operations entirely through a remote operating station. The combined cost of the yard and berth cranes is $235 million, with an emphasis on environmentally friendly cranes,” stated CS Kim, the General Manager of the container terminal.
He mentioned the procurement of 31 conventional Rubber-Tyred Gantry Cranes (RTGC), including hybrid and electric models, and 22 remote-controlled RTGs.
“This technological upgrade has significantly enhanced the port’s efficiency. Our Quay Cranes (QCs) can handle 25 moves per hour, and we have even achieved a record of 44 moves per hour,” said Muhammad Hamza Masood, the Senior Operations Manager of the container terminal.
He noted that there are 14 quay cranes onsite, capable of lifting containers weighing up to 65 tonnes under a spreader. This capability ensures safe operations for vessels up to 26 rows wide. “With the assistance of HD cameras and automation technologies, coupled with an advanced terminal operating system – nGen (next generation), our operators can comfortably work from an office environment while ensuring productivity,” he added.

7,Pakistan inks host of deals at tech event,Envoy says partnerships signify Riyadh’s role as advocate for Pakistan’s tech capabilities,"Leading Pakistani companies have signed multiple deals and partnership agreements with their global counterparts at the premier tech event, LEAP 2024, hosted by Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The third edition of the LEAP conference and exhibition, a beacon for cutting-edge technology, artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives and innovations, was being held from March 4 to 7. It boasted a gathering of over 1,800 local and international exhibitors, approximately 1,000 technical experts and 600 startups.
Among the standout achievements, Pakistan’s leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) company secured a transformative equity partnership with Saudi and Pakistani investors at the TechdestiNation Pakistan pavilion, a collaborative effort of Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) and the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP).
“This investment not only signifies a pivotal moment for Pakistan’s IT industry but also underscores Saudi Arabia’s role as a global advocate for Pakistan’s technological capabilities,” remarked Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmed Farooq.
Further strengthening Pakistan’s presence on the global tech stage, a significant partnership was forged between mobile services provider Jazz and global consultancy TenX. This collaboration aims to revolutionise data management through the Enterprise Feature Store and Predictive AI Models.
Additionally, Abacus and ELM solidified their commitment to innovation by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for laying the groundwork for future synergies.
Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) signed its biggest MoU to date during the mega event where focus would be on fostering cooperation and enhancing business-to-business engagement with the IT association in Bahrain.
Furthering the spirit of collaboration, Inbox Technologies entered into a partnership with Saudi Arabia’s Gissan, showcasing the strength of cross-border cooperation in driving technological advancement.
PSEB CEO Aisha Humera Moriani held pivotal meetings with high-ranking officials of Saudi Arabia to pave the way for future collaborations.

8,‘Priority docking a cost saving measure’,"Will reduce congestion pressures, optimise berth utilisation","The introduction of separate priority berthing queues for export vessels by Karachi Gateway Terminal Limited (KGTL) has led to an immediate cost-saving measure, providing a more competitive edge for exported goods.
Karachi, as a major port city and the economic hub of Pakistan, serves as a critical gateway for international trade.
Previously, export container vessels faced extended waits due to port congestion, worsening shipment backlogs and operational inefficiencies.
Historical inefficiencies and inadequate infrastructure have posed challenges, burdening businesses and hindering their potential.
Newly established separate priority berthing queues for export vessels at the multipurpose terminal of Karachi Port Trust’s East Wharf, managed by KGTL will address the challenges, they believe. The move is designed to accelerate the turnaround time for export shipments and enhance operational efficiency throughout the maritime supply chain.
Exports constitute a vital pillar of any nation’s economy, with the shipping industry accounting for over 90% of Pakistan’s maritime trade, showcasing its pivotal role in facilitating economic growth.
Backed by significant investment, this transformation aims to benefit the export sector and enhance Pakistan’s position in global trade. Segregating export operations at the terminal will reduce congestion pressures, optimise berth utilisation, and increase throughput capacity.
About $200,000 per vessel is spent on those waiting at outer anchorage, impacting export competitiveness.

9,PM for giving DISCOs to provinces,Forms committee to consider proposal that was not in line with SIFC decision,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday set up a committee for transferring 10 power distribution companies (DISCOs) to provinces, which was not in line with last month’s decision of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) that wanted to hand over those firms to the private sector.
The PM gave the directive to constitute a review committee to consider the proposal of handing over DISCOs to provinces, according to a statement issued by the PM Office after a meeting. Former petroleum minister Dr Musadiq Malik will chair the committee.
However, the SIFC in its last meeting on February 2 had decided that the “privatisation of DISCOs be dropped from the active privatisation list and the framework of private sector participation be finalised and got approved from relevant forums”.
Days after the SIFC decision, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) also decided to initially give two DISCOs under concession agreements on a long-term lease of 20 to 25 years to the private sector.
It is for the fourth time that a government has decided to hand over loss-making DISCOs to provinces despite the previous moves wasted time and contributed to an increase in the sector’s losses.
“We are again treading the same path and every time when privatisation is near, such proposals are thrown, which end up wasting time,” said Fawad Hasan Fawad, former caretaker minister of privatisation.
During previous attempts to transfer the ownership of power companies to provinces, only Sindh had shown the willingness and that too on the condition that the sector’s losses and obligations would remain the responsibility of the federal government.
The transfer of DISCOs to provinces will not solve the problem until it is decided to end the uniform tariff policy, under which an honest consumer of Islamabad pays for theft in Sukkur and Karachi.
The former minister said that the delay in privatising DISCOs had already caused a loss of Rs2.7 trillion in the shape of power sector circular debt.
“The power sector has the capacity not only to take down the government but also the state of Pakistan and today it is on the verge of taking down the state,” said Fawad, who is a strong proponent of outright privatisation.
He said that the decision to hand over the management of two DISCOs to the private sector had been taken after extensive discussions in a CCOP meeting, although his personal view was the outright privatisation.
There has been less focus on privatisation of the power sector, which caused losses of Rs376 billion out of the combined losses of Rs730 billion suffered by all government-owned companies in 2022.
Last month, the CCOP decided to give Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) and Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) on a 20 to 25-year lease contract. The annual State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Report showed that Gepco caused a loss of Rs20.6 billion while Hesco losses stood at Rs54.4 billion in fiscal year 2022.
When contacted, the privatisation secretary said that the privatisation programme was the prerogative of the federal government as per Section 5 of the Privatisation Commission Ordinance 2000.
He said that the addition or modification of the privatisation programme “is the competence of the federal government”.
The privatisation secretary said that the privatisation programme for the next five years would be chalked out by CCOP and the federal cabinet wherein all options for SOEs would be explored before its presentation to the federal cabinet.
Fawad said that in case provinces took the responsibility of the power sector, DISCOs would eventually become the worst local monopolies.
The PM Office stated that Shehbaz Sharif during the meeting made it clear that the responsibility of the privatisation process lied totally on the Privatisation Commission and the privatisation ministry. He also gave the directive to remove all bottlenecks in the process.
The PM stressed the need for ensuring transparency in the privatisation process and adopting the effective international standards of monitoring.
Shehbaz Sharif underlined the need for expediting the privatisation process of those SOEs that were causing a constant dent to the national exchequer and called for stabilising the economy and providing maximum relief to the common man.
“Obstacles in the way of privatisation be removed at the earliest so that the country can get rid of losses of billions of rupees and improve the economic condition,” he said while chairing the meeting.
The PM directed officials to take immediate steps to enhance the capacity of the departments linked with the privatisation process.
While reviewing the complete list and progress report on all the institutions involved in the privatisation process, the PM directed the officials concerned to submit the details of actions and goals with a clear time frame.
He told the Privatisation Commission and the ministry to present the pending issues related to privatisation to the cabinet soon after its formation for timely decisions as there was no room for further delay.
The meeting took an overview of the latest situation pertaining to the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), House Building Finance Company, First Woman Bank, Roosevelt Hotel, Heavy Electrical Complex, power plants and DISCOs, Pakistan Steel Mills and other loss-making institutions. It deliberated on the progress made so far and the obstacles confronted in this regard.
The PM directed to make the legal team effective and asked the Ministry of Law to suggest appropriate measures.
