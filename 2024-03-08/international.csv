0,Two traffic sergeants martyred in Lakki,CTD apprehends two in attack on chief minister’s chief security officer,"Two police constables were gunned down in what appears to be yet another terrorism attack in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) on Thursday. 
Separately, Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Bajaur Region has successfully arrested two accused involved in attack on the chief minister’s security officer Inspector Wakil Khan in Skhakot area of Malakand.
Police told The Express Tribune that in Lakki Marwat’s Darra Pizu Bazaar two traffic sergeants were killed when unidentified bike riders opened fire on them in broad daylight.
“Both the policemen were left critically injured in the attack. Local residents rushed them to the hospital but Constable Hafizullah died before reaching the hospital and Head Constable, Zaram Khan, breathed his last in the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ).
The bike riders managed to escape after committing the crime. 
“Both the traffic police sergeants had been deployed in the marketplace to manage traffic when they were attacked,” said a police official
The spokesperson of Lakki Marwat Police, Shahid Hameed, said that a large contingent of police reached the spot and initiated a door-to-door search operation.
He said that Hafizullah was a resident of Matora village while Zaram Khan was a native of Lowang Khel village.
Lakki Marwat has emerged as one of the hardest-hit districts in the province, witnessing a resurgence of militancy following the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in Afghanistan. The new regime’s release of TTP operatives from prison, citing irregularities in their trials under Sharia law, has afforded the TTP crucial breathing space, facilitating the reorganization of the terrorist outfit.
Meanwhile, in Malakand, police apprehended two suspects, identified as Liaqat Ali and Mujeebullah, in connection with the fatal attack on Inspector Wakeel Khan, which also claimed the life of his friend. Addressing the media, DIG CTD Imran Shahid disclosed that the assault occurred on February 17, with the recovered bike and weapons serving as key evidence against the accused.
“The attack targeted Inspector Wakeel, a special branch employee and chief security officer to the chief minister, as he rode a bike with his children and friend Naseeb Khan,” Shahid recounted. “The assailants pursued and ambushed them at Hero Shah Chowk. The ensuing gunfire tragically claimed the lives of Wakeel, Naseeb, and injured his children,” he elaborated, noting that CTD swiftly initiated an investigation, registering an FIR in the case.

2,CM Bugti takes notice of misuse of official vehicles,"Official vehicles not allowed outside province boundary, NOC to be procured for any business trip outside Balochistan","Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Ahmed Bugti has taken decisive action against the long-standing misuse of official vehicles by government officers.
In a stern directive, he has ordered that Balochistan’s official vehicles will no longer be utilized outside the province boundaries, putting an end to the flagrant disregard for regulations.
This order on behalf of the chief minister came after hundreds of official vehicles were spotted in Karachi belonging to the Balochistan government.
Under the new measures, any government vehicle intending to embark on official business outside Balochistan must obtain prior approval in the form of a no objection certificate (NOC) from the chief secretary, ensuring transparency and adherence to protocol. Furthermore, all government vehicles previously deployed in other provinces have been promptly recalled to enforce compliance with the regulations.
Bugti emphasized that no officer will be permitted to exploit official vehicles for personal use beyond their designated deployment areas, reiterating that government resources are public assets and must not be subjected to misuse. This crackdown serves as a stern warning to those who have disregarded regulations and misappropriated public resources for personal gain.
