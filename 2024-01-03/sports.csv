0,Youth training initiative launched,Institutions sign MoUs to impart market-driven skills to youth,"In a transformative leap towards the realization of the Khushhal Pakhtunkhwa Program, the Caretaker Chief Minister of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Justice (retd) Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, ceremoniously inaugurated the ‘Program for Training and Employment.’ 
This initiative seeks to equip targeted youth with market-oriented training and skills spanning various potential fields, with a profound impact anticipated on the socio-economic landscape of the province.
Embarking on its maiden phase, the program aims to empower over 100,000 young individuals, facilitating their placement in both local and international markets. To achieve this ambitious goal, crash courses in high-demand sectors such as IT, nursing, paramedics, and more are slated to be organized. 
The effectiveness of this endeavor is further bolstered by the formalization of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) between various provincial departments and pertinent institutions, underscoring a collaborative approach to youth development.
The chief minister presided over the launch ceremony at the Chief Minister’s House. Attendees included members of the provincial cabinet, the Chairman of the Higher Education Commission, administrative secretaries of relevant departments, representatives from partner organizations and institutions, senior journalists, and a substantial gathering of students.

2,Brothers acquitted in Quetta video scandal,"Court emphasises that prosecution failed to substantiate scandal case against accused, leading to their acquittal","In a notable development, a local court in Quetta has acquitted key accused Hidayat Khilji and his brother Khalil Khilji in the infamous video scandal case. 
The arrest of the two brothers had occurred over two years ago, with allegations of producing explicit videos of girls in the Marriabad Nichari area of the provincial capital.
Both the accused had vehemently denied the charges. The District and Sessions Judge in Quetta on Tuesday pronounced their acquittal in the case involving blackmail and the creation of indecent videos of girls in the Quaidabad area.
The court emphasized that the prosecution failed to substantiate the video scandal case against the accused, leading to their acquittal.

The Judicial Magistrate 7 had previously delivered a verdict on October 11 last year, sentencing Hidayatullah and Khalil to three years in prison and imposing a fine of five lakh rupees.
Challenging the trial court’s decision, the accused approached the Session Court in Quetta, where lawyer Ayaz Zahoor highlighted the rejection of the trial court’s judgment. It is essential to note that Judicial Magistrate-7 had already given a verdict in the case of creating an obscene video on October 11 last year.
The accusations against the brothers included imprisoning a girl in their house and filming her. Furthermore, additional indecent videos of girls were reportedly recovered from the accused during the investigation.
The video scandal had triggered widespread protests in Quetta, with members of civil society and political parties demanding exemplary punishment for the accused. Allegations of the girl being forced into prostitution by the two brothers added fuel to the public outcry.

3,Deadline for NCP vehicles extended,"50,000 of them registered so far in Malakand division, tribal districts","The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has announced an extension of the registration deadline for non-customs paid (NCP) vehicles in the Malakand Division until March 15, a move aimed at accommodating vehicle owners and facilitating compliance. 
Alongside the deadline extension, authorities have affirmed the region’s tax-free status, leading to the revival of nine steel mills in the area.
Originally set for December 31, the deadline for profiling and registering NCP vehicles in Malakanad Division and other former Fata districts has been granted a three-month extension. 
Sources reveal that approximately 50,000 vehicles have already been registered in this region, emphasizing the community’s response to the initiative.
In the 2016/17 fiscal year, district authorities issued distinctive colored number plates for around 120,000 vehicles in these districts, and this existing registration has been validated. 
The Malakand Trade Association has noted that several individuals registered in Malakand Division are conducting tax-free operations in other districts, sparking a social media and media campaign to address this inconsistency.
While technically businesses within the Malakand jurisdiction should enjoy tax-free status, thousands of non-local companies operating with Malakand licenses have escaped tax obligations. 
The association has highlighted the need for a fair assessment of businesses to ensure compliance with tax regulations.

In response to the previous year’s developments, the government established about a dozen registration centers for NCP vehicles, and the Federal Board of Revenue issued tax notices to various factories. This led to the temporary closure of 15 manufacturing plants dealing in ghee, steel, and plastic goods for six months. However, in a positive turn, these plants are now being reopened, contributing to the revival of economic activities in the region.
Muhammad Zahid Khan, in charge of a registration center of Excise and Taxation, revealed that the registration campaign commenced on October 16, registering 49,277 vehicles by December 25. 
He emphasized that those yet to register have until March 15 to avail themselves of this opportunity. Additionally, vehicles registered in 2016/17 with three-color number plates are considered valid, eliminating the need for re-profiling.
The labor force in the region has expressed relief with the reopening of steel mills. Maaz Khan, a laborer, shared his joy, stating that he and many others were unemployed for six months during the mill closures. The positive impact of the mills’ reopening on employment has been a significant development for the local community.
Zahid Khan, President of the Swat Hotel Association, highlighted the constitutional status of Malakand as a tax-free zone.
