Mustafa Khar’s counsel Farah Sharif Khosa contended that her client submitted his nomination papers from the National Assembly Constituency NA-180, while his wife Ayunia Mustafa Khar also submitted nomination papers from the same constituency. 
However, their nominations were rejected and they were targeted by police.
Allegedly, authorities have been harassing leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) for some time, including Khar, his family and even his in-laws. 
This is against the spirit of free and fair elections and the high court is requested to stop the harassment of the police so that the petitioner can freely participate in the election, the counsel argued.
