The district government is on the hunt for the illegal refugees living without proof of registration (POR) and Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) for repatriation. It has established a holding camp for these Afghans at Mahranwala near Mianwali.  
The sources in the district administration, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn they had received a list of 228 illegal Afghans residing in the district but only five of them could be traced who were being repatriated. The district administration is still searching for the illegal Afghans as per the list. 
However, most Afghans in the area have the proof of registration (PoR) issued by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra).  
One of the legal Afghans, Bilal Khan Sodai, who has almost lost his eyesight, had a chat with this scribe. His family was shifted to the refugee camp at Kot Chandna Mianwali in 1982 during the Afghan war. The family consists of 11 members, including five brothers and four sisters.  
“I was born here in 1992 in this camp and don’t want to be repatriated. I have never been to Afghanistan since my birth and got my preliminary education at the refugee camp Kot Chandna. Moreover, my parents told me that our houses in Afghanistan were destroyed during the war and in case of our repatriation, we have no roof over us to survive in the acute winter season.” 
Sodai says that as he grew up, he developed an eyesight issue and he is almost blind now. He moves with the support of his younger brother who was accompanying him during this chat. The family works at the agriculture farms of a landlord at Jalalpur near the camp and that’s their only livelihood. 
Sodai has applied to the (United Nation High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for resettlement to some other country where he could get his eye treatment. The UNHCR office called him and interviewed him. They informed him, through a letter on Oct 24, 2023, that his case was under process.  
Sodai says that the UNHCR was providing them more facilities earlier but now the same were being withdrawn gradually with the exception of schools and a hospital which are going to be handed over to some NGO as he learnt from the camp workers. 
During the Afghan war in 1982, two refugees camps were established in Mianwali district at Isakhel and Kot Chandna.  
The Isakhel camp was closed in 1988 and its refugees were shifted to Kot Chandna, 30km from here. This camp was established over 1,350 acres and later on extended up to 2,000 acres.  
The UNHCR built houses, schools, hospital and market in the camp whose maximum count went up to 180,000 people. Due to growing strength the UNHCR established a hospital outside the camp at Kalabagh equipped with modern facilities. As soon the refugees’ strength starts falling down, the same hospital was handed over to Punjab Red Crescent in 1997 and its machinery was shifted to Lahore. Dozens of air-conditioners and costly medical machinery disappeared mysteriously from the hospital and the mystery was never solved. In 1998, the hospital was handed over to the district health authorities who upgraded it as THQ Hospital Kalabagh and posted its staff there. However, a small hospital is still functioning at the camp.  
Dr Rafaqat Khan, in-charge of the Afghan Refugee Camp Hospital, Kot Chandna, has been serving at the camp for the last 30 years. He says that 14,000 Afghan refugees having PoR are in the camp at the moment and none of them wants to be repatriated to Afghanistan because they are financially comfortable here.  
Dr Khan knows each Afghan family in the camp. He says each Afghan in the camp wants to move to any other country but not Afghanistan.

LAHORE: Noted visual artist, poet and writer Aslam Kamal passed away in Lahore on Tuesday. He was 85.
His funeral will be held on Wednesday (today) near his residence, 568 Jahanzeb Block, Iqbal Town.  
He is survived by a widow, two sons and a daughter.  
Born in Sialkot in 1939, Aslam Kamal got his early education from Iqbal Memorial School and later did Bachelors from Punjab University.  
Kamal was known as Iqbal’s painter. In recognition of his remarkable contribution three prestigious art galleries were established consisting of his works in Aiwan-i-Iqbal, Pharmacy College, Punjab University, Lahore, and F-9 Park, Islamabad. He had nine books on art and culture to his credit. He was honoured as one of the pioneers of creative calligraphy in Pakistan.  
He was awarded the President’s Award for Pride of Performance in 1993. He was also awarded ‘lifetime achievement awards’ by Iqbal Academy Pakistan, Agriculture University Faisalabad, Lahore College for Women University and other prestigious institutions.  
He painted ‘Intellectual Cosmos of Pakistan’ on nine murals in two years in Pakistan Academy of Letters, Islamabad, which is regarded as the largest painting depicting literary integration of Pakistan. For this unique achievement his name was recommended for Guinness Book of World Records. He was a reputed multidimensional figure  of the world of painting and designing. He made a gigantic contribution by designing more than 20,000 dust-covers of books  and periodicals over the last 50 years. In this field, his name had also been recommended for Guinness Book of World Records by Urdu Science Board, Ministry of National Heritage and Integration.  
He was lucky enough to have initially encouraged by Faiz Ahmad Faiz to paint and illustrate his poetry. So, he painted Faiz’s poetry in the most individualistic and befitting manner and held numerous solo exhibitions in Germany, Norway and England. In Pakistan, Lahore Museum has the unique honour to celebrate ‘Faiz Year 2011’ with Faiz’s poetry paintings by Aslam Kamal. And this grand event inspired PNCA, Islamabad, to celebrate ‘Faiz Year 2011’ as well and pay tribute in the medium of paintings by Kamal.  
In 2013, the Punjab Institute of Language, Art & Culture (Pilac) had the unique honour to exhibit paintings of marvelous poetry of Iqbal and Faiz.  
Kamal also prepared a grand mural of 8 x 12 feet size under the title “Creative past of Punjab” for Pilac. This painting displayed in the Punjab Cultural Museum of Pilac describes the intellect of Sufi poets and cultural aspects of the province.  
He also started another project titled “Sufi poetry on canvas” under which he was supposed to paint the poetry of Punjabi Sufi poets; however, he could complete only three paintings on Hazrat Sultan Bahu, Bulleh Shah and Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, out of nine paintings. These works are on display in the Pilac museum.
Aslam Kamal’s first meeting in 1977 with Faiz Ahmed Faiz left a deep impression on him. They met at an exhibition at the art gallery of the Lahore Museum, where Kamal’s paintings interpreting Iqbal’s poetry were on display.

8,‘Institutions need to clear uncertainty surrounding polls’,LAHORE: PML-N leader and ex-federal minister Javed Latif has said it is the responsibility of the state institutions...,"LAHORE: PML-N leader and ex-federal minister Javed Latif has said it is the responsibility of the state institutions to clear the mist and uncertainty surrounding the elections.
Speaking at a press conference here on Tuesday, he said that the high inflation in the country and uncertainty about holding of general election were because of the elements who carved out a “sculpture”, but were not confessing their “crime” and failure of their objective.
He said the same elements were [still] protecting that “statue” and disallowing its dismantling, and for the purpose causing uncertain political and economic conditions in the country.
Latif alleged that a personality from Chakwal was creating the uncertainty and the state institutions should remove this mist to help bring stability in the country.
He, however, admitted that election was the only “formula” to steer the country out of the quagmire it was in, and that postponing the electoral exercise would add to the problem instead of resolving it.
The PML-N leader lamented that no one was daring to investigate the “foreign links” behind May 9 attacks, and wondered if the powers that be were waiting for a replay of the tragedy before they took action.
He asked why those accused of perpetrating the May 9 attacks were not being punished despite the passage of seven months.  
“Has the state become so weak that it cannot expose the accused and rather is buying the narrative that the mastermind is still very popular (among the masses)?”
Latif said the army is still being intimidated, so the attempts to sweep the issue under the carpet cannot work now.
He sought shunning of the impression that his party was being patronised by the powerful quarters and said that it only needed a level playing field instead of any patronage.
Referring to Jamshed Dasti’s allegations, he demanded a probe into the incident of alleged attack on the residence of the politician from Muzaffargarh and punishment for the accused. He, however, added that the masses should be informed if it was only a “drama” and a “political stunt”.

9,Farmers for urgent urea imports to address shortfall,"LAHORE: Farmers have demanded that the government import at least 200,000 tonnes more urea to meet the domestic...","LAHORE: Farmers have demanded that the government import at least 200,000 tonnes more urea to meet the domestic requirement, which is on the rise because more and more lands are being brought under cultivation while use of the compost in cereals and cotton crops is also growing.
“The current annual urea net consumption estimate stands at 7,000,000 tonnes due to increasing agricultural lands and growing usage of the fertiliser in cereals and cotton crops. Thus, we need an additional 200,000 tonnes of urea as a buffer stock to stabilise prices and maintain positive market sentiments,” Pakistan Kissan Ittehad president Khalid Khokhar said here on Tuesday.
He said that domestic urea production in 2023 barely reached 6.4 million tonnes against an annual demand of 7 million tonnes, which shows that the country may face a shortfall of 600,000 tonnes despite imports of 210,000 tonnes of the compost in December 2023 and January 2024.
He regretted that artificial shortage of the commodity being created by the dealers is further complicating the situation.
He demanded that the government develop a long-term strategy for domestic urea availability to ensure food security and prevent recurring shortages.
Also a uniform urea price should be ensured nationwide, as historically practiced, to deter middlemen from exploiting price differentials, Mr Khokhar said.
He suggested that in case of any shortfall, a prompt decision-making mechanism needs to be developed to save farmers from exploitation.
He sought an effective mechanism to mitigate the effect of increase in prices of fertilizers instead of adapting the current inefficient token-based direct subsidy scheme, which has badly failed to benefit the farmers.
The farmers’ leader said that continuously increasing crop production cost has become a challenge for small growers, constituting around 90 percent of the farming community, to pay such a high upfront input cost to cultivate crops.
Keeping in view of the production cost viz-a-viz commodity prices, rationally urea price should not be more than Rs3000 per bag, he asserted.
He said the farming community is tirelessly working to maximize wheat production to increase per acre production target from current 34 maunds to 40 maunds but is facing hindrances in access to essential inputs like Urea, which is either scarce or unaffordable.
Calling for an urgent government intervention, he said the current situation demanded immediate action and a long-term strategy to control the present circumstances and prevent recurrence in future.

Hafiz Abdul Qayyum, chairman of the Daily Passengers Association, expressed concern, stating that they had repeatedly submitted written requests to the railway authorities about the deteriorating state of the railway track from Kotmulchand to Narang Mandi.
Qayyum said the track had become dilapidated, leading to several instances of sudden breakages, narrowly avoiding major accidents. He criticised the railway authorities for their incompetence, highlighting that the speed of passenger trains from Narang Mandi to Shahdara was only 30km per hour.
Railway Traffic Inspector Javed Shah said there were no casualties or injuries in the accident. He said that work on rehabilitating the railway track was progressing, despite technical staff facing challenges working in the darkness of the night. He said within 12 hours, the track would be fully restored for train movements.
Citizens and passengers have called on the prime minister and the railway chairman to address the issues.

15,Park on old vegetable market site nears completion in Faisalabad,TOBA TEK SINGH: A 43-kanal modern public park being built on the prime land vacated by the old fruit and vegetable...,"TOBA TEK SINGH: A 43-kanal modern public park being built on the prime land vacated by the old fruit and vegetable market is nearing completion in Faisalabad.
The land was retrieved from squatters by the Faisalabad Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) as a result of a grand anti-encroachment operation launched by the Faisalabad Municipal Corporation last year.  
Earlier, the fruit and vegetable market had been shifted from the congested city area to a site near Sadhar bypass several years ago. However, different portions of the vacated land were occupied by land grabbers.
Commissioner Ms Silwat Saeed told reporters on Tuesday that an amount of Rs320 million has been approved by the Punjab government for the construction of this public park on the vacated piece of land.
She said the company given the contract for the park’s construction had been asked to increase the workforce so that the project could be completed by Jan 31.
She said that she has also ordered further upgrade of the play area for children in the park and to provide high-standard facilities to the visitors. She said separate washrooms have also been built in the park for men, women, children and special persons.
PHA Director general Zameer Hussain says the park also features walkways, a jogging track, an outdoor gymnasium, fountains, horticulture work and a food court. 
CODE OF CONDUCT: Faisalabad District Monitoring Officer (DMO) Muhammad Zubair Watto has said that the pana-flexes displayed by candidates in violation of the code of conduct issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), for Feb 8 polls, have been removed across the district.
In a press release issued on Tuesday, he said that under the code of conduct, candidates were bound to abide by the ECP directions. He added that candidates can only display posters having 18x23 inch size, handbills, pamphlets, 9x6 inch leaflets, 3x9 foot banners and 2x3 foot portraits during their election campaign.
