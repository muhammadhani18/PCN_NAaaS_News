0,"2,000 evacuated as volcano erupts  in Indonesia","MAUMERE: More than 2,000 residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters amid heightened volcanic activities in ...","MAUMERE: More than 2,000 residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters amid heightened volcanic activities in a volcano in eastern Indonesia, a local official said on Tuesday.
Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki in East Nusa Tenggara province has erupted several times in recent weeks, including an eruption on Monday that spewed volcanic ash 1.5 kilometres above its peak, according to the Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG).
The agency recorded another eruption from Lewotobi Laki-Laki on Tuesday but ash clouds from the volcano were not observed, it said in a statement.
Volcanic ashes from recent eruptions have affected two sub-districts near Lewotobi Laki-Laki mountain, prompting more than 2,200 residents to evacuate to temporary shelters set up by local governments, Benediktus Bolibapa Herin, an official for East Flores district, said on Tuesday.
“There are 1,931 evacuees in the Wulanggitang (sub-district), and 328 evacuees in the Ile Bura (sub-district),” Herin said, adding that the number of the evacuees could rise as more people seek safety from the volcano.
“Due to the increase in (Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki’s) status, the communities must be relocated to safe zones to anticipate unwanted things.” Authorities on Monday raised the volcano’s status to the second-highest of Indonesia’s four-tiered alert levels and expanded the exclusion zone from two kilometres to four kilometres around its crater.
The volcano’s ashes also forced Frans Seda Airport, located more than 80 kilometres away, to close since Monday, state news agency Antara reported.

1,Russia accidentally bombs own village near Ukraine,The accident occurred the same day as Russia hit Ukraine with a large-scale missile attack.,"MOSCOW: Russia said it had accidentally bombed a village in its southern Voronezh region near Ukraine on Tuesday but stressed there were no casualties.
The accident occurred the same day as Russia hit Ukraine with a large-scale missile attack. It is not the first such incident during Moscow’s almost two-year-long Ukraine offensive.
In April last year, the Russian army acknowledged that one of its warplanes accidentally drop­ped a bomb in its own city of Belgorod, near the Uk­raine border, causing a blast.
“On January 2, 2024, at around 9am Moscow time, during a flight of the Aerospace Forces, an abnormal discharge of aircraft ammunition occurred over the village of Petropavlovka in the Voronezh region,” the Russian army said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies.
“There are no casualties,” it added. Petropavlovka lies some 150 kilometres east of the Ukraine border.
The ministry said six private houses were damaged in the accident, Russian news agencies reported.
“An investigation into the circumstances of the incident is underway. A commission is working on the ground to assess the nature of the damage and provide assistance to restoring houses,” the statement read.
The governor of the Voronezh region, Alexander Gusev, said some of Petropavlovka’s residents have been moved to temporary accommodation. He also said there were no casualties but said there was  “destruction recorded in seven households.”

2,Five die after JAL airliner crashes into plane at Tokyo airport,At least 17 people onboard the airplane injured as crew of smaller craft killed in collision.,"TOKYO: All 379 people aboard a Japan Airlines (JAL) plane escaped the burning airliner after a collision with a Coast Guard aircraft at Tokyo’s Haneda airport that killed five of six crew on the smaller craft on Tuesday.
Live footage on public broadcaster NHK showed the JAL Airbus A350 airliner burst into flames as it skidded down the tarmac shortly before 6pm. “I felt a boom like we had hit something and jerked upward the moment we landed,” a passenger told Kyodo news agency.
 






“I saw sparks outside the window and the cabin filled with gas and smoke.”  All 367 passengers and 12 crew were evacuated from the blaze which destroyed the airliner.
At least 17 people on it were injured, NHK reported, citing the Tokyo Fire Department. Trans­port Minister Tetsuo Saito confirmed that five of the Coast Guard aircraft’s crew had died while the captain of the plane had been injured.
 






A ministry official told a press briefing the JAL plane was attempting to land normally when it collided with the Coast Guard’s Bombardier-built Dash-8 maritime patrol plane on the runway.
There had been no reports of engine or other problems on the airliner before the landing, the official said. The Coast Guard said its plane was headed to Niigata on Japan’s west coast to deliver aid to those caught up in a powerful earthquake that struck on New Year’s Day, killing at least 55 people.
A JAL official told a press briefing it was the airline’s understanding that the flight had received permission to land, although he added that exchanges with flight control were still under investigation.
 






Video footage and images shared on social media showed passengers shouting inside the plane’s smoke-filled cabin and running across the tarmac after escaping via an evacuation slide.
 






“The cabin crew must have done an excellent job… It was a miracle that all the passengers got off,” said Paul Hayes, director of air safety at UK-based aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium.

3,Monster quake claims  50 lives in Japan,"Many buildings damaged by fire, houses flattened, fishing boats sunk and highways hit by landslides","WAJIMA: Japanese rescuers battled the clock and powerful aftershocks on Tuesday to find survivors of a New Year’s Day earthquake that killed at least 50 people and caused widespread destruction.
Japanese news agency Kyodo put the death toll to 57, citing local officials, as rescuers comb through the rubble.
The 7.5 magnitude quake that rattled Ishikawa prefecture on the main island of Honshu triggered tsunami waves more than a metre high, sparked a major fire and tore apart roads.
On the Noto Peninsula, the destruction included buildings damaged by fire, houses flattened, fishing boats sunk or washed ashore, and highways hit by landslides.
“I’m amazed the house is this broken and everyone in my family managed to come out of it unscathed,” said Akiko, standing outside her parents’ tilting home in the badly hit city of Wajima.
The way 2024 started  “will be etched into my memory forever”, she said after what she called the long and violent earthquake on Monday. “It was such a powerful jolt,” Tsugumasa Mihara, 73, said as he queued with hundreds of others for water in the nearby town of Shika.“Very extensive damage has been confirmed, including numerous casualties, building collapses and fires,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said after a disaster response meeting.
“We have to race against time to search for and rescue victims of the disaster.” Aerial news footage showed the terrifying scale of a fire that ripped through the old market area of Wajima, where a seven-storey commercial building collapsed. Quake damage impaired rescue efforts to put out the blaze. Most of the houses in the coastal city of Suzu collapsed, according officials cited by Kyodo.
“The situation is devastating, as about 90 per cent of houses have been completely or nearly completely destroyed,” Suzu Mayor Masuhiro Izumiya was reported as saying at a prefectural government meeting.
Almost 33,000 households were without power in the region, which saw temperatures touch freezing overnight, the local energy provider said. Many cities were without running water.
The US Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 7.5. Japan’s meteorological agency measured it at 7.6, and said it was one of more than 210 to shake the region through Tuesday evening.
Several strong jolts were felt early on Tuesday, including one measuring 5.6 that prompted national broadcaster NHK to switch to a special programme. “Please take deep breaths,” the presenter said, reminding viewers to check for fires in their kitchens.
Tsunami warning lifted
On Monday, waves at least 1.2 metres (four feet) high hit Wajima and a series of smaller tsunamis were reported elsewhere. Warnings of much larger waves proved unfounded and on Tuesday, Japan lifted all tsunami warnings.
Images on social media showed cars, houses and bridges in Ishikawa wobbling violently as terrified people cowered in shops and train stations.

4,South Korea’s opposition chief stabbed by assailant,SEOUL: South Korea’s opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung was stabbed in the neck during a visit to ...,"SEOUL: South Korea’s opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung was stabbed in the neck during a visit to the southern city of Busan on Tuesday and was airlifted to Seoul after receiving emergency treatment, party and emergency officials said.
Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election, was conscious and was flown to Seoul National University Hospital in the capital, after a man attacked him as he was moving among a crowd of supporters and journalists at a public event.
An official at the Pusan National University Hospital, where Lee first received emergency care, said the transfer to Seoul was possible after medical staff determined his condition was not life-threatening based on initial treatment and a CT scan. 
Party spokesman Kwon Chil-seung, speaking outside the hospital soon after Lee was airlifted by helicopter, said medical staff suspected damage to a jugular vein that carries blood from the head to the heart. “There is concern that there could be large haemorrhage or additional haemorrhage, according to medical staff,” Kwon said. The attack by the assailant, seen in video footage and photographs, unfolded quickly while Lee was touring the site of a proposed airport in Busan.

5,Bangladesh opposition on the run despite not contesting vote,Abdul Moyeen Khan says police ransacked the homes of BNP leaders and workers in frequent nighttime raids.,"DHAKA: As general elections approach this week in Bangladesh, opposition leader Abdul Moyeen Khan says he had to hide out in the homes of a string of acquaintances until nominations closed, trying to escape a government crackdown.
The former minister and his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are not running in the Jan 7 vote, in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is chasing a fourth straight term, despite a bleak economy that needed an IMF bailout last year.
“We’re not even in the election, but they are still not sparing us,” the grey-haired Khan, 77, said in Dhaka, the capital, on his return home in Dece­mber after nominations closed and removed any risk that he could pose an electoral threat.
 

Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s Standing Committee member Abdul Moyeen Khan gestures during an interview with Reuters at his residence in Dhaka, Bangladesh on Dec 18, 2023.— Reuters

His party boycotted the vote after Hasina refused to cede power to a caretaker government to run the poll. Now it says 10 million party workers are on the run after the arrests of nearly 25,000 following deadly anti-government protests on Oct 28.
“Police and other government agents were hunting for our leaders, particularly in their homes,” said Khan. “The situation instilled fear in our minds.”
Conditions were worse than at the time of the last election in 2018, when attacks on party workers kept him from holding even a single rally, he added.
Hasina and her Awami League have repeatedly condemned the BNP as troublemakers out to sabotage the elections, rebuffing warnings by rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) that the crackdown aimed to subdue the opposition.
The BNP contested the last election but kept out of the fray in 2014. And New York-based HRW has said Bangladeshis will again be denied the right to freely choose their leaders.
In a November report, the rights group put the number of arrests of BNP activists at 10,000, with two police officers among at least 16 dead and about 5,500 injured in the violence.
“The jails are overcrowded, with statistics showing the number of inmates is double capacity,” said Khan, who wore a mask, cap and sunglasses to obscure his identity as the pace of arrests picked up.
Police ransacked the homes of BNP leaders and workers in frequent nighttime raids, he said, even detaining family members of those who evaded them. Some hid out in forests, paddy fields and cemeteries to escape, two other party leaders said.
However, police say they arrested only those involved in the violence, with one senior officer rejecting the opposition estimates as incorrect.
“Police are arresting only those involved in killings and attacks, vandalism and arson,” said the officer, who sought anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
The crackdown comes at a time when the opposition leadership finds itself in disarray, as ailing party president Khaleda Zia, herself a former prime minister famed for a bitter, decades-long rivalry with Hasina, keeps out of active politics.
Although her son has temporarily taken the mantle, he is in exile, and the party’s next most senior leader, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, has been in jail since Oct 29.

6,Petrol pumps run dry in India  as truck drivers protest,NEW DELHI: India’s northern city of Chandigarh imposed restrictions on the sale of petrol and diesel at fuel...,"NEW DELHI: India’s northern city of Chandigarh imposed restrictions on the sale of petrol and diesel at fuel stations on Tuesday after a strike involving drivers of fuel tankers disrupted supply in the region, the local government said.
A similar rush was seen at fuel stations in other parts of the  country, including in the western state of Maharashtra and the southern  state of Telangana, according to local media reports.
Home  Secretary Ajay Bhalla is expected to meet the All India Motor Transport  Congress — a group of transporters that is part of the protest — late on  Tuesday evening to discuss the matter, reported Indian news agency ANI.
Drivers of trucks, buses, and tankers launched a three-day strike on Monday to protest a new law that prescribes punishment of up to 10 years’ imprisonment or a maximum of 700,000 rupees ($8,405) fine for those who run away without informing authorities after causing serious road accidents.
Protesters say the provision, which is part of a new criminal law that will replace the colonial-era Indian Penal Code (IPC), can lead to undue harassment of drivers, local media reported.
The IPC, in contrast, prescribes a punishment of up to two years for such an offence. The government is yet to notify a date for enforcement of the new law.
“Effective immediately, two-wheelers are limited to a maximum of 2 litres (maximum value of Rs200) and 
four-wheelers are limited to 5 litres (maximum value of Rs500) of fuel per transaction,” the Chandigarh administration said in a statement on its website.

7,Gazans scavenge wood for makeshift shelters,"For the Maarouf family, living in Rafah’s tent city, home is now the small campfire they sit around each night.","RAFAH: For the Maarouf family, living in Rafah’s tent city after fleeing their house in Gaza at the start of Israel’s deadly bombardment nearly three months ago, home is now the small campfire they sit around each night.
Supplies of wood, scavenged from ruined buildings, were exhausted long ago in the devastated Palestinian enclave, and the small fires of displaced, destitute people are now fed with bits of cloth or plastic.
“There is no safety. We’re scared, I swear. My children are scared and say to me, ‘Dad we’re out in the open.’ I tell them ‘God help us, where can we go?’” said Shadi Maarouf, his face lit up by the firelight.
Nearly all the Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million people have lost their homes, driven out by a shattering bombardment and ground offensive that Israel launched after Hamas fighters rampaged across the border on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people.
More than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment, health authorities in Gaza say.
The tiny coastal territory’s population now live packed into communal shelters in UN schools or in makeshift camps crowded around the streets of Rafah, near Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, and a few other centres.

The Maaroufs, from Beit Lahia close to the northern border with Israel, fled on the first day of the war. They sought refuge in a shelter in another northern district but found it to be unsafe and moved on.
They stayed in al-Nuseirat, in central Gaza, for a month but air strikes came close too often. Then they moved south, to Rafah, right on the frontier with Egypt.
The family now sit around the campfire outside their tent made of pieces of wood and tarpaulin. They hold their four-month-old baby and play with her or warm their hands near the stuttering flames.

By night the tent city is ghostly. Gaza’s electricity gave out early in the war after Israel cut off power supply and fuel for generators. Only solar power remains. Occasionally a tent is lit from inside by a flashlight, its plastic sheeting glowing dimly in the night.
Shadi Maarouf, his wife Safeya and their six children huddle for warmth against the biting cold.  “This life in Rafah is a tragedy, Maarouf said. We sleep in fear, said Safeya Maarouf, who struggles to find diapers and baby formula for her daughter.
“What can we do? There is no shelter. The life and conditions are difficult, for us and everyone else, all the people, not just us. All the people are suffering, they are all in pain. There are no bathrooms, no water, no warmth, no safety. We sleep in fear,” she said.

“We have received numerous initiatives concerning the internal (Palestinian) situation and we are open to the idea of a national government for the West Bank and Gaza,” Haniyeh said in a televised address.
Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip since winning the 2006 Palestinian elections, which were followed by violent clashes with the Fatah party of Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas.
Multiple attempts at reconciliation between the factions have failed, while Abbas’s popularity as head of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank has plummeted. The United States has stressed Palestinians must be part of any future administration, but the role of the internationally-recognised Palestinian Auth­ority remains unclear.

9,Harvard president to resign,"NEW YORK: The president of Harvard University has decided to resign, the prestigious US school’s student newspaper...","NEW YORK: The president of Harvard University has decided to resign, the prestigious US school’s student newspaper reported, after she faced criticism over allegations of plagiarism and her handling of “anti-Semitism” on campus.
Claudine Gay was criticised in recent months after reports surfaced alleging that she did not properly cite scholarly sources in her academic work. The most recent accusations came on Tuesday, published anonymously in a conservative online outlet.
Gay was also engulfed by scandal after she declined to say unequivocally whether calling for genocide of Jews violated Harvard’s code of conduct, during testimony to Congress alongside the heads of MIT and the University of Pennsylvania last month.
The university’s governing Harvard Corporation backed her after her appearance before Congress, but did criticise her response to the Oct 7 raid in Israel.
More than 70 lawmakers, including two Democrats, called for her resignation, while a number of high-profile Harvard alumni and donors had called for her departure.
Still, more than 700 Harvard faculty members had signed a letter supporting Gay.
“Harvard President Claudine Gay will resign on Tuesday afternoon, bringing an end to the shortest presidency in the University’s history, according to a person with knowledge of the decision,” the student-run Harvard Crimson reported.
The university’s governing Harvard Corporation said that Gay had  “shown remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks.”  “While some of this has played out in the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls. We condemn such attacks.” In the United States, the anti-Semitism on campus controversy came amid a rise in attacks and violent rhetoric targeting Jews and Muslims, including at universities, since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.
The president of another elite Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania, had already been forced to resign.
The House Republican who challenged Gay out during her testimony with the question about whether free speech extended to calling for genocide of Jews celebrated the latest academic’s downfall.
Gay, 53, was born in New York to Haitian immigrants and is a professor of political science who in July became the first Black president of 368-year-old Harvard University, in Cambridge, outside Boston.

10,Only 15pc of Israelis want Netanyahu  to keep job,IDI survey shows 56pc of those questioned say continuing the military offensive is the best way to recover the prisoners.,"JERUSALEM: Only 15 per cent of Israelis want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stay in office after the Gaza crisis subsides, though many more still support his strategy in the Palestinian enclave, according to a poll published on Tuesday.
Netanyahu has said such intense military pressure is also vital to ensure that the remaining 129 prisoners still held in Gaza are returned after around 100 were freed in late November in a swap deal also involving hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
In the poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), 56 per cent of those questioned said continuing the military offensive was the best way to recover the prisoners, while 24 per cent thought a swap deal including the release of thousands more Palestinian prisoners from Israel’s jails would be best.
But a mere 15 per cent want Netanyahu to be prime minister once the crisis is over, the poll showed. His political rival and present cabinet partner, centrist Benny Gantz, garnered support from 23 per cent of interviewees.

South Africa asked the ICJ on Friday for an urgent order declaring that Israel was in breach of its obligations under the 1948 Geneva Convention in its crackdown against Hamas.
“The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at The Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel,” spokesman Eylon Levy told an online briefing.
“We assure South Africa’s leaders, history will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy,” Levy said.
South Africa has for decades backed the Palestinian cause for statehood in Israeli-occupied territories. It has likened the plight of Palestinians to those of the Black majority in South Africa during the apartheid era.
The ICJ, sometimes known as the World Court, is the United Nations venue for resolving disputes between states. Israel’s foreign ministry has said the suit was  “baseless”.  
Lawyers representing South Africa are preparing for the hearing scheduled for Jan 11 and 12, Clayson Monyela, a spokesperson for South African government, said.

12,Aid heads to Gaza after screening in Cyprus,Foreign Secretary David Cameron says Britain was committed to supporting the people of Gaza.,"NICOSIA: Britain and Cyprus have sent 87 tonnes of aid to Gaza via Egypt, the two countries said on Tuesday, with Cypriot officials saying they had successfully tested a screening mechanism for cargoes offering an alternative route for badly needed supplies.
The Jan 1 delivery to Port Said in Egypt for transfer to Gaza through the Rafah border crossing fell short of Cyprus’s ultimate objective to establish a direct aid corridor to the Israel-besieged Palestinian enclave. But, for the first time, it offered a workaround on how aid could be accelerated by eliminating security checks in Israel itself, officials said.
The Cypriot initiative to create a sustained, one-way sea route into Gaza entails aid undergoing security checks in Cyprus by government agencies, including from Israel, before being dispatched onwards from the eastern Mediterranean island.
“The international community now has a workable alternative at its disposal to send additional humanitarian aid to the population of Gaza,” Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said in a written statement.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Britain was committed to supporting the people of Gaza.
“Significantly more aid needs to reach Gaza to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people,” he said.
Eli Cohen, Israel’s outgoing foreign minister, said on Sunday his country was prepared to let ships deliver aid to the enclave “immediately”.
Cyprus, situated some 370 km north-west of Gaza, is the closest European Union member state to the region. Its plan is meant to expand capacity for humanitarian relief to the Gaza Strip beyond limited deliveries now being made overland through Rafah. Any direct sail to Gaza with Israel’s consent would mark the first easing of an Israeli naval blockade first imposed on Gaza in 2007 after Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.
But underscoring logistical challenges, the British  auxiliary ship which offloaded thermal blankets, shelter packs and medicine in Egypt on Monday was at sea for at least 10 days awaiting clarity as to whether it could sail directly to Gaza, individuals with knowledge of the situation said.
The direct route is not currently executable due to requirements including security matters which have “not been met at this point in time”, one of those sources said.
“The situation is very dynamic and we will continue to deliberate with all relevant stakeholders on the best time and way to operationalise the initiative,” the source said.

13,Blair denies link to role in Gazans’ ‘resettlement’,LONDON: Britain’s former prime minister Tony Blair has denied an Israeli media report linking him to talks last...,"LONDON: Britain’s former prime minister Tony Blair has denied an Israeli media report linking him to talks last week about the resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza in other countries. 
On Sunday, Channel 12 claimed that Blair, who left office in 2007 and served as a Middle East envoy charged with building up Palestinian institutions, was in Israel last week. 
The news channel said he held meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and cabinet member Benny Gantz about a mediation role between Hamas and Israel after the Gaza crisis eases. 
He could also act as a go-between with moderate Arab states about the “voluntary resettlement” of Gazans, it added. 
Expelling civilians during a conflict or creating unlivable conditions which force them to leave is a war crime.  The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a non-profit organisation he set up in 2016, said the report was “a lie”. 
“The story was published without any contact with Tony Blair or his team. No such discussion has taken place,” it said in a statement on Monday night. 
“Nor would Tony Blair have such a discussion. The idea is wrong in principle. Gazans should be able to stay and live in Gaza.” 
Unwelcome person
The Palestinian presidency in Ramallah lashed out at the report. The presidency said it would demand that the British government “not allow this meddling with the fate and future of the Palestinian people”. 
“We also consider Tony Blair to be an unwelcome person in the Palestinian territories,” it said, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. 
The Channel 12 report came after two far-right Israeli ministers called for Jewish settlers to return to the Gaza Strip and that Palestinians should be encouraged to  emigrate. 
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads the ultranationalist Religious Zionism party, told Israeli army radio: “To control the territory militarily for a long time, we need a civilian presence.”  
And on Monday, Israel’s firebrand National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said: “We must promote a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza’s residents.” UN chief Antonio Guterres and the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, are among those who have spoken out against the possible forced transfer of Gazans.

14,Shipping firms still wary of Red Sea route,OSLO: Denmark’s Maersk and German rival Hapag-Lloyd said on Tuesday their container ships would continue to avoid...,"OSLO: Denmark’s Maersk and German rival Hapag-Lloyd said on Tuesday their container ships would continue to avoid the Red Sea route that gives access to the Suez Canal following a weekend attack on one of Maersk’s vessels.
Both shipping giants have been re-routing some sailings via Africa’s southern Cape of Good Hope as Yemen-based Houthis attack cargo vessels in the Red Sea. The disruption threatens to drive up delivery costs for goods, raising fears it could trigger a fresh bout of global inflation.
Maersk had on Sunday paused all Red Sea sailings for 48 hours following attempts by Houthis to board the Maersk Hangzhou. US military helicopters repelled the assault and killed 10 of the attackers.
“An investigation into the incident is ongoing and we will continue to pause all cargo movement through the area while we further assess the constantly evolving situation,” Maersk said in a statement.
“In cases where it makes most sense for our customers, vessels will be rerouted and continue their journey around the Cape of Good Hope.”  
Maersk had more than 30 container vessels set to sail through Suez via the Red Sea, an advisory on Monday showed, while 17 other voyages were put on hold.
Hapag-Lloyd said its vessels would continue to divert away from the Red Sea _ sailing instead via Africa’s southern tip _ until at least Jan 9, when it will decide whether to continue rerouting its ships.
The Suez Canal is used by roughly one-third of global container ship cargo. Redirecting ships around the southern tip of Africa is expected to cost up to $1 million in extra fuel for every round trip between Asia and northern Europe.
Oil prices
Worries about potential disruption to Middle Eastern supply after the latest Red Sea attack drove oil prices higher in the first trading session of the new year.
Expectations that longer routes will result in higher freight rates have pushed up shipping companies’ shares since the crisis began, and shares in Maersk were up 6.3 per cent in late afternoon trading. Hapag-Lloyd shares were up five per cent.
Unlisted French shipping group CMA CGM will increase its container shipping rates from Asia to the Mediterranean region by up to 100 per cent as of Jan 15 compared to Jan 1, according to a notice on its website on Tuesday.
The Maersk Hangzhou, which was hit by an unknown object during the weekend attack, was able to continue on its way, with LSEG shipping data showing the vessel close to the Suez Canal on Tuesday.
The Houthis, who control parts of Yemen after years of fighting, started attacking international shipping in November in support of Hamas.
That prompted major shipping groups, including Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, to stop using Red Sea routes, instead taking the longer journey around the Cape of Good Hope.
But after the deployment of a US-led military operation to protect ships, Maersk had said on Dec 24 that it would resume using the Red Sea.
According to Maersk, its alliance partner Mediterranean Shipping Company was continuing to divert its vessels via the Cape of Good Hope.

15,Turkiye detains 33 suspected of spying for Israel,It was not immediately clear if they were Israeli nationals or locals allegedly working with Mossad.,"ISTANBUL: Turkiye announced on Tuesday it had detained 33 people suspected of planning abductions and spying on behalf of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service.
Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the suspects were rounded up in raids across Istanbul and seven other provinces.
It was not immediately clear if they were Israeli nationals or locals allegedly working with Mossad.
Yerlikaya’s office relea­s­ed video footage showing armed security service agents breaking down doors and handcuffing suspects in their homes.
The Istanbul public prosecutor’s office said 13 additional suspects remained at large.
The raids came weeks after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of  “serious consequences” should Israel attempt to target figures from Hamas living or working in Turkiye.
“There is an insidious operation and sabotage attempts being made against Turkiye and its interests,” Erdogan said after the raids were announced. “We will definitely destroy this game,” he said in televised remarks.
Relations between Turkiye and Israel imploded following the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly three months ago. Erdogan has turned into one of the world’s harshest critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Turkish leader last week compared Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and demanded that Israel’s Western allies drop their support for the  “terrorism” being conducted by Israeli troops in Gaza.
Erdogan has also recalled Ankara’s envoy to Tel Aviv, and pushed for the trial of Israeli commanders and political leaders at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
The president’s ruling Islamic conservative AKP party also led tens of thousands of protesters out on the streets of Istanbul on Monday for one of Turkiye’s biggest anti-Israel rallies of the entire war.
End of thaw
The Gaza crisis ended a gradual thawing in Turkish-Israeli relations that culminated with the reappointment of ambassadors in 2022. Israel and Turkiye resumed long-stalled talks about a major Mediterranean Sea natural gas pipeline project that could have reshaped geopolitical alliances across parts of the Middle East.
Turkiye won words of gratitude from Israel in 2022 for detaining a group of Turkish and Iranian nationals were allegedly planning to murder and kidnap Israeli tourists in Istanbul.
Erdogan and Netanyahu met briefly on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York in September and were discussing holding a formal summit this year.
