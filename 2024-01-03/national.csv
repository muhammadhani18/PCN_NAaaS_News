Sartaj Aziz

 
LAHORE: For­m­­er fo­­reign minister and senior PML-N leader Sartaj Aziz passed away on Tu­esday at the age of 95.
His funeral will be held at 2:30pm today and he will be laid to rest at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.
President Arif Alvi, caretaker PM Anwaarul Haq Kakar, Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jillani and Information Minister Murtaza Solangi expressed their condolences on his demise, as the PML-N confirmed the news. 
Ahmed Bilal Mehboob of Pildat on his X handle wrote, “One of the ablest, most hardworking & upright Pakistani, Mr Sartaj Aziz, passed away.” He said it was an honour to work with him on some key Pildat initiatives.
Born in 1929, Sartaj Aziz received his education at Islamia College, Lahore, and Punjab University. During his student life, he actively participated in the Pakistan movement and remained active in the electoral campaign of All India Muslim League in 1946.
After the creation of Pakistan, Mr Aziz joined the civil service in 1950 and pursued higher education at Harvard University. He served as the joint secretary of the Planning Commission and also worked with the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation.
In 1985, Mr Aziz was elected as a senator, and during the Zia era, he assumed the position of minister for state. He served as finance minister during the 1990s cabinet of then prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Later, he held the positions of adviser for foreign affairs and national security.

3,Pildat calls for transition from hybrid to normal democracy,Notes that democracy in Pakistan is stuck in a familiar and deepening rut at the end of 2023.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Insti­tute of Legislative Develop­ment and Transparency (Pildat) has called for an immediate transition from the so-called hybrid system to a normal functional democracy.
“Deferring course correction may not be an option much longer. It may be a luxury the country of young Pakis­tanis cannot afford,” the institute said in its Quality of Democracy report for 2023.
It noted that democracy in Pakistan was stuck in a familiar and deepening rut at the end of 2023. The past year had only made the hoped transition towards improved democracy that much harder for the country now called an electoral autocracy by some international democracy rating think tanks.
Pildat report pointed out that remedies and lessons were obvious, but the people who have the power and capacity to pull the country out of the rut have not taken the right steps for the last 70 years.
It noted that the transition could be initiated with a simple change of perspective and by marshalling the required will followed by purposeful consultations in the National Security Committee.

Says chances of fair polls as bleak as they were in 2018; top parties appear ‘addicted to patronage of establishment’

“Will the coming election and the post-election arrangement provide a flip to move in that direction? It is difficult to be optimistic but on the first day of the new year, we re-dedicate ourselves to continue working for a democratic Pakistan despite the challenges on the horizon,” the report says.
The think tank said that prospects of general election fairness appear just as bleak as the 2018 general election largely agreed to be a manipulated election.
Despite the oft-repeated interference in the political process, leading political parties appear “addicted to the establishment’s patronage” to win a managed public popularity and form fractured governments.
The outgoing chief of army staff, rather conveniently and belatedly, publicly admitted to the Pakistan army’s interference in the political and electoral processes.
The report noted that political parties and popular leaders continually suffer from a crisis of confidence as their political fate depends not on their popularity or the cogence of their governance policies but how adept they are at keeping the military establishment positively engaged and play second fiddle.

4,PTI holds out  olive branch  to opponents,Says all major parties should strive to rectify past mistakes instead of pointing fingers at each other.,"ISLAMABAD: Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Dr Shahzad Wasim on Tuesday underlined the need for charting out a national agenda in line with contemporary needs, saying that political forces must sit together to roll heads to find out solution to the problems facing the country and determine minimum common ground.
Speaking in the Senate, Dr Wasim highlighted that there was an urgent need to reset nat­ional priorities, noting that economic stability and continuity of policies should rank on top of the consensus national agenda.
The PTI leader said, “We will have to set aside ego, and personal and political agenda.” All the major political parties have remained in power, and committed mistakes on their part, he said, adding that efforts should be made to rectify the mistakes instead of pointing fingers at each other.
 
 

“In the past, priority of the governments had been to complete five-year term and punish the political opponents,” he said. He also referred to the incidents of snatching of nomination papers, crackdown on leaders, workers and candidates of a political party and a fresh wave of terrorism in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Balochistan and noted that conduct of free and fair elections were not possible under the present circumstances.

He highlighted that elections were a competition not a war and stressed that difference of opinion should not be taken to the level of animosity. He called for bringing down the political temperature, giving way to each other and move ahead with spirit of tolerance.
He said an environment for a healthy electoral competition had to be created where level playing field was available to all and poll campaigns could be freely conducted.
PM criticised for Baloch remarks
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was the criticism against caretaker Prime Minis­ter Anwaarul Haq for his rema­r­­ks against the Baloch protesters.
PML-N Senator Saadia Abba­­si condemned the caretaker pri­me minister for his comments on the Baloch protestors, saying that he insulted the people’s rig­hts this way.
On a point of public importance, she noted that the caretaker prime minister said on Mon­day that those protesting were anti-national people and that their sympathisers should go and join banned outfits.
Senator Abbasi regretted that it was unfortunate that a person with limited mandate and role had such views against people of his own province. She wondered if those who disappeared were anti-national, then why a case was not registered against them and were they not presented before a court.
“The PM has in­­s­ulted this House where a discussion was held yesterday and many members spoke on the matter,” she remarked.

5,‘Remarks unbecoming’ — PM Kakar’s views on missing persons touch a nerve,"“It is not something new he has said about Balochistan… it may be new for the rest of the country,” says analyst.","Caretaker Prime Minister Anwa­ar­­ul Haq Kakar’s outburst against Baloch protesters, who have been camped out in Islamabad, has struck a nerve — both among his supporters and critics.
“It is not something new he has said about Balochistan… it may be new for the rest of the country,” says Asif Baloch, who is editor of the daily Azaadi, an Urdu language newspaper in Quetta.
Indeed, there are many in the province who believe that his words on Balochistan’s missing persons’ issue were quite calculated, well thought out, and planned.
Mr Kakar’s view on the issue has been consistent, at least since his tenure as the spokesman for former chief minister Nawab Sanaullah Zehri in 2015.
In a column about his first meeting with Mr Kakar during a seminar on Balochistan in Quetta, noted journalist Zahid Hussain recalled: “He vehemently disputed my assertion on missing persons. ‘Why do you only talk about missing persons?’ he asked, in front of the military top brass sitting in the front row.”
These views are not unique to Mr Kakar, either. There are many in the Balochistan hierarchy who share his stance on the issue.
 
 

Jan Achakzai, the incumbent caretaker information minister for the province, also fully endorsed the caretaker prime minister’s words.
“His statement is straight and candid… none [of the politicians] can challenge the militants in Balochistan who kill innocent people, while [PM Kakar] challenged them, nor his stance is vexed,” he told Dawn on Tuesday.
“His stance is not compromised, and he is not using it for a power grab. What he feels, he says it,” said Mr Achakzai, who is also known for his hawkish views.
Professor Mumtaz Baloch, who teaches political science at the University of Balochistan, told Dawn that as the prime minister, Mr Kakar should avoid making such inflammatory remarks.
“He is now the representative of the nation, as well as having the highest position in the land,” he told Dawn.
“It is said that the state is like a mother,” he says, paraphrasing an oft-used term in Urdu. “If a citizen asks a question, [those in power] should respond affectionately, instead of giving harsh statements, which are tantamount to cornering the marginalised. That is detrimental to the state itself.”
In Balochistan and elsewhere in the country, the missing persons’ issue has been a major bone of contention between citizens and the state apparatus.
Even Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, in his observations during Tuesday’s hearing at the Supreme Court, noted that the issue was a genuine one. “This country belongs to all of us, even those who may have other points of view. This matter will only be resolved when we all work together and take responsibility,” he observed.
For those affected by the issue, such as the families of those who have been missing for many years and months, the prime minister’s words have come as a major blow.
For instance, the story of Dr Deen Muhammad Baloch, a Baloch physician and politician who has been missing for 14 years, is a case study in enforced disappearances.
His daughter, Sammi, has been campaigning for his return since she was a young girl of 10, being a permanent fixture at sit-ins, hunger strikes and other demonstrations in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan.
At the age of 15, in 2014, she participated in the Voice of Baloch Missing Persons march to Islamabad. Now, as an adult, she is one of those at the forefront of the sit-in currently being held in Islamabad. However, the young Baloch girl has yet to get any sort of closure.
“Two things matter: policies and behaviour,” says Mumtaz Baloch. “Through good policies and behaviour, the state or its leaders can resolve the people’s issues. If the state of Pakistan… acts in the light of the 1973 Constitution to resolve the genuine issues of its people, including those from Balochistan, it can make a difference and pave the way for a peaceful environment in the country.”
But such inflammatory statements do not suit a prime minister, let alone the caretaker one as the province he is talking about has already been bereft of peace for over 20 years “due to such attitudes”, says Quetta-based analyst Jalal Noorzai.
“Balochistan’s issues, which are political in nature, have to be dealt with through dialogue and the door of negotiations should always remain open, particularly at a time when there is a caretaker setup mandated to hold elections in the country,” he says.
In the immediate aftermath of the prime minister’s outburst, human rights activists and members of civil society roundly denounced his “insensitive, provocative” remarks.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, former senator Farhatullah Babar said the prime minister should have “sought to put balm on the wounds of the people” since he himself hailed from Balochistan, but instead, “chose… to rub salt into the wounds of the people of the province. This is most unfortunate and condemnable.”
 






Lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir also said Mr Kakar’s “irresponsible and provocative statements” had no intent other than to “push peaceful people to take up arms against any form of injustice”.

Officials said that six prisoners, who were under trial in a local court, were held in a judicial lock-up in a police station. They managed to break the heavy steel door of the lockup and escape by climbing the back wall of the police station.
