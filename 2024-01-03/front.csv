0,Alvi for women’s economic empowerment,Stresses importance of providing women with enabling work environment to increase economic participation,"President Dr Arif Alvi on Tuesday stressed improving the status of women by providing them with an enabling work environment to increase their economic participation.
The president highlighted that following the rights granted by Islam, it was the responsibility of the society to give them their due share and create a safer society for them.
He expressed these views while chairing a meeting during his visit to the Federal Ombudsman Secretariat for Protection Against Harassment at Workplace (FOSPAH) Head Office, in Islamabad.
Federal Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment at Workplace Fauzia Viqar, Secretary FOSPAH Arif Karim, advisers and officials of FOSPAH attended the meeting.

He said that he was conducting personal hearings of the ombudspersons’ cases to expedite the process of justice.
He stated that highlighting important decisions of FOSPAH in harassment and women’s property cases through media would help increase awareness about the role of the Ombudsman.
The president said that police at the local level needed to improve their response to women’s complaints in property cases, adding that police officials should be educated about the provisions of the Enforcement of Women’s Property Rights Act, 2020.
He urged FOSPAH to further increase its outreach and efficiency to provide speedy justice to women in harassment and property cases at their doorsteps.
He also advised FOSPAH to enhance its linkages with NGOs and women’s rights organizations in Pakistan to seek suggestions for improving women’s status.

1,One of three candidates violated tax law,Contenders either unregistered or non-filers of income tax returns,"One out of every three candidates contesting for the seats of the national and provincial assemblies turned out to be either unregistered or non-filer of income tax returns in the last three years, scrutiny carried out by the Federal Board of Revenue revealed.
The high numbers of non-filers and unregistered persons aspiring to become representatives of the people indicate the prevailing non-tax culture in Pakistan, which has now become a serious issue.
A little over 4,200 aspirants were non-filers of income tax returns during any of the past three tax years 2021, 2022 or 2023, according to government sources.
In addition to this, another little fewer than 5,000 people were not registered with the tax authorities, the sources said.
FBR spokesperson Afaque Qureshi did not respond to a request for comments.
The Election Commission of Pakistan had shared the data of about those 28,000 candidates who had submitted their nomination papers for contesting the Feb 8 elections.
Of those, a total 9,200 were either not registered with the FBR or were registered but did not file the returns in any of the past three years, the sources said. This translates into one out of every three candidates not being compliant with the tax laws of Pakistan.
Under the Income Tax Ordinance, every person earning Rs600,000 a year or having a 1,000cc car is obligated to register with the FBR and also file tax return.
The government has already initiated a campaign against the non-filers.
FBR Chairman Amjad Zubair Tiwana said last week that the FBR would start taking action against non-filers by disconnecting their mobile sim cards and utility connections.
The FBR on Tuesday requested the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to set up a liaison committee for blocking mobile phone sim cards of the non-filers.
The Election Commission secretary did not reply to a question whether a non-filer of income tax returns could contest the general elections.
The ECP’s election guidelines required that the candidates must file their income tax returns for the last three years.
The ECP on Monday issued details of the total number of candidates who submitted nomination papers for the general elections and the number of nomination papers rejected and accepted by the commission. There were many candidates who submitted more than one nomination papers.

About 3,204 nomination papers were rejected by the returning officers during the scrutiny process. The reasons for the rejections were not known.
Given the fact that over 9,200 candidates were not complying with the tax laws, there would still be thousands of candidates contesting the elections despite violating the act of parliament.
The electoral body approved nomination papers of 6,449 candidates, including 6,094 male and 355 female candidates, for the National Assembly seats. The papers of 1,024 candidates, including 934 men and 90 women, for NA seats were rejected by the returning officers during the scrutiny process.
The ROs appointed by the electoral body approved 16,262 nomination papers for the four provincial assemblies of the documents submitted by 18,478 candidates, including 17,670 males and 808 females.
The sources said that the FBR also highlighted outstanding tax liabilities against over 1,100 candidates who had to settle these dues before acceptance of their nomination papers.
They said that an estimated over Rs5.5 billion to Rs6 billion was recovered from these candidates.
The recoveries included revisions in previously filed tax returns and wealth statements by these candidates, indicating that some of them might not have in the past fully disclosed their actual worth.
The amount of tax that these candidates paid was quite higher than the total income tax paid by 392 members of the National Assembly and the Senate in 2019.
The FBR had released the tax directory of the parliamentarians in 2022, containing tax details for the period of 2019.
In 2019, 392 members of the National Assembly and the Senate declared a cumulative income of Rs11 billion but they paid a mere Rs576 million in taxes. This means that the parliamentarians paid just 5.2% of their income – far lower than the standard maximum tax rate of 35% for a salaried person.
These 392 legislators paid a cumulative sum of Rs576 million in taxes against Rs800 million in the year before – showing a decline of 28%.
It seems ironic that the returning officers have not accepted the papers of the defaulter candidates who were filers but papers of the non-filers and the unregistered persons have been accepted.

2,PHC restores ECP's decision on PTI internal polls,PTI loses electoral symbol of 'cricket bat' again after lifting of stay order,"In a significant turn of events, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday lifted the injunction it had placed on the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) order against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) intra-party election and its electoral symbol of ‘cricket bat’ for the upcoming general elections. The court accepted the ECP's supplementary petition, saying that the injunction went beyond its defined limits and that the decision could impact elections across the country.
The latest PHC ruling effectively paves the way for the ECP to resume proceedings in the case and potentially proceed with its initial decisions. “For the purpose of decision of the instant application suffice it to observe that the order of this Court dated 26.12.2023 is liable to be recalled,” said the written order issued by Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan at the end of the hearing.
Giving reasons for the court order, the judge said that, firstly, the order was ad-interim ex-parte order as it was passed without providing any opportunity of hearing to the ECP and secondly, the interim order, prima facie amounted to the granting final relief for all legal, factual and practical purposes. “Thirdly while passing the said order, an aspect of its effectiveness beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this Court was not taken into consideration; and fourthly as under the election laws the whole exercise of holding and conducting an election… is a time bound exercise,” the order continued.

“Therefore, the said order has prima facie created hindrance in the smooth process of the election which is to be conducted by The ECP as per the already notified schedule and which is to be held on the instant 8th of February,” the written order stated. The saga began on December 22 when the ECP deemed PTI's internal elections flawed and declared the party's paperwork insufficient for issuing its official certificate. PTI challenged this decision in the PHC, which granted a temporary injunction on December 26, putting the ECP's actions on hold.
However, the ECP fought back, filing supplementary petitions on December 30 arguing that the injunction overstepped the court's authority and could delay the upcoming general elections. After two days of arguments from both sides, the court ultimately sided with the ECP, lifting the injunction. PTI's lawyer Qazi Muhammad Anwar argued that the ECP's petition was inadmissible and lacked legal basis, as the ECP did not have the authority to file a supplementary application.

Qazi further said that the PHC had given its decision on December 26 but it had not been implemented yet. The ECP, represented by Sikandar Bashir Mohmand, countered that it has both administrative and constitutional powers and was well within its rights to challenge such decisions in court. He added that if the party was to be de-listed, it could file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
Naveed Akhtar, representing the Charsadda vice president of the PTI, expressed concerns about the transparency of the party's internal elections and alleged irregularities surrounding Imran Khan's candidature. He sided with the ECP, highlighting the importance of fairness throughout the entire electoral process. At the conclusion of the arguments, Justice Ijaz Khan accepted the supplementary petitions of the ECP and withdrew the PHC’s injunction.
The judge noted that since timeframe had been fixed for holding the elections and other preparations, this injunction could not be maintained. The hearing was adjourned till January 9.  With the injunction lifted, the ECP is now free to move forward with its initial decisions of annulling the intra-party elections of the PTI and taking back its ‘bat’ symbol. The party might appeal the latest decision or attempt to defend its case before the court on the next hearing scheduled for January 9.
