However, the benchmark KSE 100 index closed above the 64,000 level.
Beating the government’s projection of 21pc with a big margin, the first-half inflation for FY24 surged to 28.79pc compared to 25.02pc in the corresponding period last year on the back of rising food and electricity prices. The reading for December quickened to 29.7pc from 29.2pc in the preceding month. 
Topline Securities Ltd said the index demonstrated volatility posting an intraday high of 671.92 points to 65,333.70 and a decline of 448.16 points to 64,213.63. 
Wild price fluctuations during the trading hours were observed in Hub Power Company Ltd, Mari Petroleum Company Ltd, Systems Ltd, Engro Corporation Ltd, and Lucky Cement Ltd, collectively incurring a loss of 176 points. 
On the flip side, stocks like Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Oil and Gas Develop­ment Company Ltd and Meezan Bank Ltd contributed to a combined gain of 112 points.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the slump in global equities, growing uncertainty about general elections and investor concerns over challenges of whopping losses of ailing state-owned enterprises played a catalyst role in the market’s bearish close.
The Pakistan People’s Party Sindh leadership warned its past allies — PML-N and JUI-F — to refrain from playing games to delay general elections saying any such move should be considered as contempt of the Supreme Court order.
The KSE-100 index closed at 64,349.60 points after losing 312.18 or 0.48 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume increased 7.4pc to 671.6 million shares. The traded value increased 31.99pc to Rs24.5bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric Ltd (79.85m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (46.48m shares), Bank of Punjab (34.95m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (34.95m shares) and Fauji Cement Ltd (30.47m shares).
Companies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd (Rs86.76), Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (R31.53), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs27.94), Indus Motor Ltd (Rs17.51) and Mehmood Textile Mills Ltd (Rs13.00).
Companies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Tobacco Ltd (Rs58.47), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs47.11) Pakistan Engineering Company Ltd (Rs43.74) Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs22.15) and Service Industries Ltd (Rs19.45).
Foreign investors, however, remained net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $0.69m.

1,Oil prices drop,"The market thinks it is ""unlikely that the Iranian warship will engage with American warships"", says Lipow Oil Associates president.","HOUSTON: Oil prices shed value during the first session of 2024, on the back of interest rate jitters and as concerns eased that tensions in the Red Sea could disrupt supplies.
Brent crude was down 45 cents, or 0.6 per cent, at $76.59 a barrel at 13:15 p.m. ET (18:15 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude was down 60 cents, or 0.8pc, at $71.05.
Prices rose briefly in early trade after attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels over the weekend, and the reported arrival of an Iranian warship on Monday. Both benchmarks had risen around $2 on Tuesday before edging back down.
“The market is correcting itself in so far as there have been no supply disruptions and they think it is unlikely that the Iranian warship will engage with American warships,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.
“Clearly, the oil market will move higher if shots are fired.”
U.S. helicopters on Sunday repelled an attack by Iran-backed Houthi forces on a container vessel operated by Danish shipper Maersk in the Red Sea. An Iranian warship had entered the Red Sea on Monday, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.
Denmark’s Maersk and German rival Hapag-Lloyd said their container ships would keep avoiding the Red Sea route that gives access to the Suez Canal.
A wider conflict could close crucial waterways for oil transportation.

3,Divestment of Heavy Electrical Complex complete,"Privatisation minister expresses hope the move will result in increased productivity, new employment, tax revenue and forex earnings.","ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commi­ssion on Tuesday completed the divestment process of Heavy Electrical Complex (HEC) by handing over the share certificates to the buyer IMS Engineering (Pvt) Ltd.
In a final settlement of the Rs1.4 billion transaction, the buyer has not only made the full payment but also taken over additional liabilities of Rs752 million payable to the Bank of Khyber.
The government divested its entire equity stake of 96.6pc of shareholding. HEC, owned by the State Engineering Corporation of Pakistan, was engaged in the manufacturing of power transformers with an annual designated capacity of 3,000 MVA.
 
 

HEC is located on prime industrial leasehold land of about 62 acres in the Hattar industrial estate.
Privatisation Minister Fawad Hassan Fawad congratulated all the stakeholders who contributed towards the conclusion of the sale agreement including the Special Investment Facilitation Council, State Bank of Pakistan, ministries of finance and industries, and other senior officials were present on the occasion.
Bank of Khyber has issued an NOC for the conclusion of the transaction.
The minister also informed the ceremony that the HEC buyers are replacing the current set-up with state-of-the-art German-made machinery and equipment and will also endeavour to meet local demand which is currently met through imports.
Mr Fawad expressed the hope that the privatisation of HEC will result in increased productivity, new employment, tax revenue as well as foreign exchange earnings for the country.
IMS Chairman Mahmood Haq said that a plan for better utilisation of the facility is already in place which is expected to be able to make exports of $250 to $300m in two to three years.

4,Rupee snaps 13-session winning streak,"“The depreciation is negligible and does not indicate that the dollar will keep app­reciating against PKR,” says a currency dealer.","KARACHI: The rupee snapped its 13-session winning streak as it lost three paise against the US dollar to Rs281.89 in the interbank market on Tuesday.
However, market experts said the meagre gain didn’t reflect a comeback of the bullish dollar which hit an all-time high of Rs307 against the local currency on Sept 5, 2023.
“The depreciation is negligible and does not indicate that the dollar will keep app­reciating against PKR,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dea­ler in the interbank market.
 
 

However, he maintained, that the exchange rate stability remained unhurt despite the rupee losing three paise. During the last 13 sessions, the rupee appreciated by just Rs2.04 against the greenback.
Currency experts believe that several factors have supported the exchange rate along with administrative measures. The State Bank of Pakistan had succeeded in keeping the foreign exchange reserves around $7bn which jumped by $853m in the second last week of December.
Also, the narrowing trade gap with a growth in exports, positive signals from the IMF tranche and the crackdown against illegal currency business all contributed to exchange rate stability.
“A major step was restricting banks to arrange dollars themselves before opening any letter of credit for import,” said a banker.
“There is a possibility that the rupee once again starts showing strength in coming days since Pakistan has qualified for the last tranche of $1.2bn under the $3bn SBA in March this year,” said a senior analyst.
However, the analyst said the surging inflation could be a hurdle in the IMF board meeting scheduled for Jan 11.

5,Petroleum consumption falls 15pc,12pc and 3pc decline in two- and three-wheelers' demand results in slow off-take of diesel and petrol.,"KARACHI: The first half of FY24 ended on a dismal note for the petroleum sector due to a 15 per cent drop in sales of petroleum products to 7.686 million tonnes from nine million tonnes in the same period last fiscal year.
Petrol sales posted a drop of 7pc to 3.57m tonnes during the July-December period from 3.83m tonnes in the same period of FY23 despite a price drop to Rs267.34 from Rs331.38 per litre in September 2023.
 
 

High-speed diesel (HSD) price had also fallen to Rs276.21 from Rs329.18 in September 2023 but diesel sales shrank by 6pc to 3.16m tonnes from 3.36mn tonnes in 1HFY23.
The overall fall in sales of cars, LCVs, pickups and jeeps by 50pc to 33,638 units during July-November FY24 from 67,107 units in the same period last fiscal year followed by 12pc and 3pc decline in two- and three-wheelers demand had resulted in slow off-take of diesel and petrol. Truck and bus sales had also remained low by 48pc and 45pc during 5MFY24.
Furnace oil (FO) sales clocked in at 0.56m tonnes from 1.45m tonnes during 1HFY23, down by 61pc.
However, FO sales witnessed a jump of 54pc during November 2023 to 82,000 tonnes from October 2023 due to a shortage of RLNG/gas and reduced hydel power generation in winter months, leading to a switch to FO-based power generation.
In December 2023, FO sales stood at 79,000 tonnes posting a drop of 36pc year-on-year and 4pc month-on-month.
Sales of overall petroleum products also remained depressed by 7pc to 1.24m tonnes during December 2203 from 1.33m tonnes in December 2022.
Petrol and HSD sales during December 2023 stood at 0.57m tonnes and 0.51m tonnes as compared to 0.62m tonnes and 0.52m tonnes during December 2022, showing a fall of 8pc and 2pc, respectively.
Market people said that a slowdown in demand for petrol and diesel reflects consumers’ buying behaviour as they are already perturbed over inflated utility bills and high food inflation, thus limiting their purchase of fuels as per their requirement despite a drop in petrol and diesel prices.

6,Exports jump 22pc in December,Trade gap narrows to $11.14bn in first half.,"ISLAMABAD: Merchandise exports grew for the fourth consecutive month in December, reaching an 18-month high, indicating a recovery of export-led industrial growth.
In absolute terms, the export proceeds were recorded at $2.82 billion in December against $2.30bn over the corresponding month last year, indicating a growth of 22.21pc, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday.
On a month-on-month basis, the export proceeds increased 9.29pc.
 
 

The export of goods in the first half of FY24 increased by 5.17pc to $14.98bn against $14.24bn in the corresponding period last year.
The continued rise in export proceeds in December suggests that the textile and clothing sectors are beginning to secure orders from global clients following a year of downturn.

Trade gap narrows to $11.14bn in first half

Caretaker Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz stated that exports reached $2.8bn in December 2023 compared to the potential of $3bn per month.
“We will soon achieve our capacity and then proceed to the next step,” he said, adding that the commerce ministry’s goal is to increase export-led development to $8bn per month through a new policy under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) framework.
 






Mr Gohar further said in a statement that the commerce ministry remains committed to strengthening Pakistan’s export potential and creating a conducive environment for sustainable economic growth.
According to a preliminary report, the increase in overall export value was mostly driven by semi-finished goods in the textile sector, while value-added garment exports remained negative. Furthermore, in the non-textile sector, the export earnings of food goods, particularly rice and beef, have posted unprecedented increases in recent months.
The commerce ministry has yet to announce the strategic framework to provide regional competitive energy pricing, working capital support, speedy refund payments, enhanced market access, and diversification of products.
 
 

However, the imports declined by 12.25pc to $4.52bn in December from $5.14bn in the same month last year. The negative growth in imports also continued for the last few months.
On a month-on-month basis, the imports declined by 0.55pc. The import bill fell 16.28pc to $26.13bn in July-December FY24 from $31.21bn over the corresponding months last year.
The imports fell 31pc to $55.29bn in FY23 from $80.13bn in FY22. The government has projected an import target of $58.69bn for FY24 against $55.29bn in FY23, an increase of $3.4bn or 8.14pc.
The trade deficit narrowed 34.29pc to $11.14bn in July-December FY24 from $19.96bn over the corresponding months of last year. The trade deficit contracted 40.13pc to $1.70n in December from $2.84bn over the corresponding month last year.

7,Half-yearly cement sales rise 10pc,Two major issues currently being faced by the industry are related to the new Axle Load Regime and Track and Trace system.,"KARACHI: Some revival in construction activities propelled local cement sales by a mere one per cent year-on-year to 20.223 million tonnes during July-December of FY24, while exports soared by 111pc to 3.653m tonnes from 1.734m tonnes the same period a year ago.
As a result, the cumulative cement despatches (domestic and export) grew 9.7pc to 23.876m tonnes in 1HFY24 versus 21.674m tonnes, according to the data released by All Pakistan Cement Manu­facturers Associa­tion (APCMA) on Tuesday.
A spokesman of APCMA, however, expressed serious concerns over the negative growth in domestic sales in December. He hoped that the government would speed up Public Sector Development Projects (PSDP) to increase cement demand and also give attention to the operational problems of cement makers.
 
 

Two major issues currently being faced by the cement industry are related to the new Axle Load Regime and Track and Trace system.
“We have approached the functionaries concerned and expect to get a positive response,” he added.
Due to thin construction activities during winter, domestic cement despatches fell by 4pc to 3.536mn tonnes in December 2023 from 3.676m same month last year. Export swelled by 156pc tp 524,656 tonnes from 205,0061 tonnes.
Total cement despatches (domestic and export) during December 2203 rose by 4.63pc to 4.06mn tonnes from 3.881mn tonnes in December 2022.
As per data from Sensitive Price Index (SPI) ending Dec 28, 2023, the average price of a 50kg cement bag had risen to Rs1,232 from Rs1,043 during the week ending Dec 29, 2022, a rise of 18pc.
