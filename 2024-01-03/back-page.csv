LONDON: The story of how an English fashion student lost her artwork, and eventually recovered it thanks to the kindness of a Pakistani photographer, has captivated social media.
Grace Hart, 20, now a fashion student at Manchester Metro­politan University, says she was heartbroken some years earlier when she discovered that her mother had accidentally discarded her art portfolio as it was kept in black bin bags.
“I was applying to university at the time and was gutted to lose the material. My mother called charity shops when she realised what had happened, but they all said they didn’t take any paper or books. We panicked then,” Ms Hart told Dawn.
Although the student and her distraught mother eventually gave up their search, deliverance came from unexpected quarters, thousands of miles away in Pakistan.

Story of how fashion student Grace Hart’s portfolio ended up at a Lahore thrift shop has captured people’s imaginations on social media

The fashion student told Dawn she was stunned when, on New Year’s Day in 2022, she received an Instagram message from a stranger saying he had found her artwork at a thrift shop in Lahore.
“We’ve never really discovered how it got to Pakistan. All my work was in bin bags next to other bin bags which had sort of a mix of charity bags or trash bags.”
The contents of those bags had ended up at a thrift shop in Saddar Bazaar, Lahore. There, they caught the eye of Lahore-based fashion photographer Tajwar Munir.
Mr Munir said her work caught his eye and he was amazed that someone would throw that work away. He said he came across “nearly 200 pieces of art” at the thrift shop.
“I don’t go there very often, but my mother is a regular as she was born in Saddar and knows the good shops and places to eat. These thrift shops have very cool things, from sculptures, to art and one-off pieces.”
“I was going through stuff in the shop as I was looking for pieces to put in my room. I planned to cut the pictures and have them framed, when the thought occurred to me: ‘how can someone throw this work or give it away’?”
Mr Munir said the paintings were all signed by Grace Hart, and he proceeded to search for her on Instagram.
Ms Hart told the BBC she initially mistook the message for a scam and almost didn’t respond. But when the two connected, she was overjoyed. “He got in touch with me a year after I lost them. I remember thinking ‘Oh my God — he’s found them’.”
Mr Munir shipped the material to the United Kingdom to its owner, which she received in July 2022.
“We’ve exchanged loads of messages on Instagram. Without him, I would never have got my books back,” Ms Hart said.
Mohammad Anis, the owner of the shop where the photographer discovered her lost artwork, said his shop sells random items that have been purchased from UK charity shops. His shop, B.UK collection, is located near Delhi Road in Lahore Cantt.
“This is all stock people throw away [in the UK] or what we call kabarr. Our vendors overseas get it from charity stores, pre-loved item stores, or even homes. They buy all this stock, and then it goes to warehouses in the UK. From there, it comes to us,” Mr Anis told Dawn over the phone.
“Mostly, it is crockery, electronics and toys.”
In small video clips shared over Whatsapp, Mr Anis showed decorative plates, framed art and tiles on display in his shop. “We pay between Rs500 and Rs1,000 per kilo for these bulk items, and then sell them to our customers.”
Mr Anis said he has been in the business for about 15 years. “We have an eye for what is good. Sometimes we get single pieces from crockery sets of Wedgwood and Royal Albert. Women who have these sets at home and have a few broken plates come to us to find pieces.”
In 2015, a BBC report titled ‘Where do your old clothes go?’ described how used clothing donated to charities in the UK ends up getting shipped abroad, including to Pakistan.
The story of Ms Hart’s lost and found artwork was shared by many on social media, including historian William Darymple. Many praised it as a “heartwarming” or “feel good” story with some saying Tajwar Munir was the “first hero of 2024”.

1,Khunjerab Pass opens for 14-day trade window,"Pakistan, China agreed to year-round operation last year.","GILGIT: The Pakistan-China border at Khunjerab Pass opened temporarily on Tuesday for 14 days for trade activities.
According to a letter sent by the embassy of China to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pakistan, the Chinese side has agreed to facilitate the opening of the China-Pakistan Khunjerab Pass from Jan 2 to Jan 16, 2024.
It said, during this period, only transportation vehicles, drivers, and cargoes will be allowed to pass between the two countries through the Khunjerab Pass.
According to customs officials, a dozen Chinese containers, some of them carrying goods and mostly empty for carrying export items, arrived at the Sost Dry Port through the Khunjerab Pass on Tuesday.
The Chinese government had closed the Khunjerab Pass from Nov 30 last year for four months in winter, almost a month after agreeing to keep the high-altitude road open throughout the year.
On Oct 20, after caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the Third Belt and Road International Cooperation Summit Forum in Beijing, both countries agreed to make Khunjerab Pass operational year-round.
Subsequently, the Chinese authorities issued a notice stating that the two countries would need to amend and sign the agreement on border ports and management systems through diplomatic channels to keep Khunjerab Pass open year-round. The notice added that China’s State Port Management Office would seek acceptance from relevant authorities.

Pakistan, China agreed to year-round operation last year

“[Until] the State Port Management Office of the People’s Republic of China issues an official notice, Khunjerab Port will continue to adopt the seasonal mode of customs clearance, with normal closure from December to March,” the notice stated. In case of any special needs, Xingiang’s Khunjerab Port management will apply for a temporary opening of the pass.
Khunjerab Pass connects Gilgit-Baltistan with China’s Xinjiang region and is the highest paved international border at 15,500 feet from sea level. Under the border protocol agreement signed between the two countries in 1985, the pass remains open for travel and trade between April and November. In winter, trade and travel are hampered due to excessive snowfall.
Imtiaz Shigri, Assistant Collector Customs, Sost, told Dawn that Pakistan Customs would facilitate the trade activities during the temporary opening. He said that customs officials were already deputed at Sost dry port for customs clearance of the imported and exported consignments.
Replying to a question, the assistant collector made it clear that the pass has been opened temporarily for the transportation of goods only, and not for travel.
President of GB Importers and Exporters Association Mohammad Iqbal said GB traders had inked deals to import and export consignments through Khunjerab year-round after the announcement to keep the border open throughout the year.

2,‘Hamas No 2’ killed in Israeli drone strike on Beirut,"Palestinian Red Crescent HQ in Khan Yunis hit; Gaza death toll now at 22,185.","GAZA / BEIRUT: Israel’s aggression reached the Lebanese capital on Tuesday, where a strike killed the deputy leader of Hamas, Saleh al-Aruri, the group and security officials in Lebanon said.
A high-level security official said that Saleh al-Aruri was killed along with his guards in the strike.
Another official confirmed the information, adding that two floors of the targeted building and one car were damaged.
Lebanese state media reported the strike hit a Hamas office in Beirut’s southern suburbs, said to be a stronghold of Hezbollah. Hamas TV also said Israel had killed Aruri in Beirut, while Lebanese media reported that a total of six people were killed in the strike.
Lebanon’s prime minister condemned Israel’s killing of Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri in Beirut’s southern suburb on Tuesday, saying the attack “aims to draw Lebanon” further into the Israel-Hamas war. 

Palestinian Red Crescent HQ in Khan Yunis hit; Gaza death toll now at 22,185

“Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the explosion in the southern suburbs of Beirut that killed and injured many,” his office said in a statement.
The strike will add to persistent fears that the nearly three-month-old Israeli war in gaza could become a wider conflagration.
Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Han­iyeh, speaking on Tuesday before Aruri’s death, said Israeli prisoners would only be freed “on terms set by the resistance”.
Aruri, who lived in exile, is accused by Israel of masterminding numerous attacks. He was elected deputy to Haniyeh in 2017, before being officially named the group’s number two.
In October the Israeli army demolished Aruri’s home in the occupied West Bank.
Intense bombardment
Over the last 24 hours, the health ministry in Gaza confirmed that 207 Palestinians lost their lives in 15 Israeli attacks, while an additional 338 individuals sustained injuries in incidents reported on Tuesday. 
The overall death toll from Israeli bombing of the besieged enclave now stands at 22,185 — including 9,100 children — and 57,000 injured.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that a strike by the Israeli army on its Khan Younis headquarters resulted in the death of at least five displaced Pales­tinians. Simultaneously, Israeli raids across the occupied West Bank have claimed the lives of at least five more Palestinians, Al-Jazeera reported. 
Separately, Israel announced the death of a Palestinian prisoner, who was in their custody since October 7, the seventh such incident reported. Palestinian groups have condemned the incident as an “assassination.” 
Al Jazeera described a period of “intense bombardment” in both central and southern areas of Gaza throughout Monday night and in the early hours of Tuesday.
Israeli forces targeted a residence in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah, resulting in a significant number of casualties, with the majority being women and children, Palestinian outlet Wafa News Agency reported.

4,BRICS’ ranks swell as five more states join bloc,Saudi state TV announces the kingdom has officially joined platform.,"DUBAI: Saudi state TV said on Tuesday that the kingdom has officially joined the BRICS bloc of countries.
The BRICS bloc that previously included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa was set to double with Saudi Arabia joining the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Iran, and Ethiopia as new members.
Saudi Arabia’s entry comes amid geopolitical tensions between the US and China, and the expansion of China’s influence within the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister had earlier said the kingdom would study the details before the proposed Jan 1 joining date and take “the appropriate 
decision”. Prince Faisal bin Farhan had said the BRICS group was “a beneficial and important channel” to strengthen economic cooperation.

Saudi state TV announces the kingdom has officially joined platform 

The BRICS memberships of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Iran and Ethiopia officially took effect on Monday.
Despite continued strong ties with the US, Saudi Arabia has increasingly pursued its own path out of concern that Washington is less committed to the Gulf’s security than in the past.
China, Saudi Arabia’s biggest oil customer, has led calls for the BRICS to expand to become a counterweight to the West.
Global South
The expansion could amplify the group’s declared ambition to become a champion of the Global South, although Argentina signalled in November it would not take up an invitation to join. 
The six countries were invited to join the group in August 2023 after the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, CGTN reported.
BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, with five new members — Egypt, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia — formally becoming full-fledged members of the bloc, contains more than 40 per cent of the world’s population and over 30pc of global gross domestic product.
The platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries has received numerous membership requests in recent years.
“Expansion of the BRICS multilateral bloc to include Saudi Arabia and UAE augurs extremely well amid ongoing geopolitical and economic challenges confronting the world economy,” Ullas Rao, assistant professor of finance at Edinburgh Business School of Heriot-Watt University in Dubai, said.
“Both Saudi and the UAE as [among] the richest countries on per capita and home to the biggest sovereign wealth funds, create enormous growth opportunities through investments, trade and commerce.”

5,"Pakistan, US discuss ‘crucial bilateral issues’",ISLAMABAD: Care­taker Foreign Mini­ster Jalil Abbas Jilani on Tuesday underscored the need for building on the...,"ISLAMABAD: Care­taker Foreign Mini­ster Jalil Abbas Jilani on Tuesday underscored the need for building on the newly gained momentum in relations between Pak­istan and the United States. 
He stated this during a meeting with US Amba­ssador to Pakistan Donald Blome, which served as a follow-up to recent high-level exchanges between the two countries, including Army Chief Gen Asim Munir’s visit to the United States. 
The Foreign Office said the meeting focused on “major aspects of bilateral relations”, though specific details were not disclosed. However, it was mentioned that Gen Munir’s recent visit to the US was a topic of discussion. 
The US Embassy, meanwhile, revealed that the dialogue covered a range of crucial bilateral issues, including expanded diplomatic engagement, the resettlement of Afghan citizens to the United States, and other mutual interests. 
In 2023, Pakistan-US relations have been characterised by a mix of security cooperation, economic inte­ractions and diplomatic engagements, alongside occa­sional tensions. Desp­ite the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and resultant challenges, the two countries have continued cooperation in various fields, including health, clean energy, disaster response, trade and investments. 
However, the bilateral relationship has also faced challenges. For instance, US President Joe Biden’s lack of direct engagement with Pakistani leaders and his critical remarks about Pakistan in 2022 had caused some strain. 
Despite these complexities, recent months have seen a series of high-level diplomatic engagements and dialogues focusing on trade, energy, education and defence, indicatingefforts to restore and enhance bilateral relations.
