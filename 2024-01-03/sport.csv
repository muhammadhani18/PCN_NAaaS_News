PERTH: Serbia’s Novak Djokovic eyes a return against Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic during their United Cup match on Tuesday.—AFP

 
PERTH: Novak Djokovic insisted Tuesday a sore right wrist which required on-court treatment was  “not a major concern” as he led Serbia into the quarter-finals of the United Cup.
The world number one dro­pped a set in grinding past the Czech Republic’s Jiri Lehecka 6-1, 6-7 (3/7), 6-1 and required several visits from the trainer.
He did not take part in the deciding mixed doubles, instead watching from the team bench as Olga Danilovic and Hamad Medjedovic defeated Czech pair Miriam Kolodziejova and Petr Nouza 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 10-8.
It put Serbia into a last-eight clash with Australia on Wednesday.
The result means that defending champions the United States are out, with one more day of quarter-final play in Perth to go before the event shifts to a weekend finish in Sydney.
“It happened in the warm-up today before the match,” said Djokovic of the wrist issue, which comes barely a week ahead of his defence of the Australian Open.
“I basically got constant treatment before the match, during the match, after the match, you know, trying to address the issue that I’m facing today in the best possible way.
“I know professional sport in general, these things happen. I think it’s not a major concern, because I still managed to finish the match and managed to play well, even though I maybe wasn’t feeling 100 per cent.
“Hopefully I’ll have enough time to recover for tomorrow’s tie against Australia,” added the 24-time Grand Slam champion.
Czech Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova started the tie by defeating Danilovic 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, handing Djokovic a comeback assignment as he took on Lehecka to take it to the deciding doubles.
“It was amazing, I didn’t have luck in singles but thank god we have Novak with us,” Danilovic said after sending Serbia through in the doubles.
The 113th-ranked Medjedovic added:  “I know how tired Olga was, she gave everything she could, and did it for us.”
Poland will face China in the other Perth quarter-final on Wednesday.
In Sydney, Stefanos Tsitsipas, beaten by Djokovic in the Australian Open final last year, also struggled with an injury, to the lower back.
The Greek world number six was expected to meet Chilean number one Nicolas Jarry, but sat it out, leaving team-mate Stefanos Sakellaridis to step up.
Sakellaridis, just 19 years old and ranked 416, put up an outstanding fight against the 19th-ranked Jarry, but fell short 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.
Greek world number eight Maria Sakkari had earlier earned a commanding 6-0, 6-1 victory over Chile’s outclassed Daniela Seguel.
Tsitsipas returned for the crucial mixed doubles decider with Sakkari, but they lost 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 10-6 to Seguel and Marcelo Tomas Barrios Vera.
“It’s amazing, amazing,” Barrios Vera said.  “It’s our second match as a team, so we’re super happy.”
Tsitsipas, who reached the Aus­tralian Open final last year, losing to Djokovic, was clearly struggling on serve late in the match, grimacing as he held his back.
While watching Sakkari’s singles, he told the host broadcaster  “there are a few chances I might not play and there are a few chances that I might” against Chile. “I’m kinda 50-50 so far. We’ll wait and see.”
A six-time Grand slam semi-finalist, Tsitsipas has 10 ATP Tour titles to his name, but is still searching for a first major win.
In the other Sydney tie, Donna Vekic and Borna Coric overcame Arantxa Rus and Tallon Griekspoor respectively to give Croatia an unassailable 2-0 lead over the Netherlands.

1,Spanish star Hermoso testifies about Rubiales’s World Cup kiss,Rubiales is also accused of “coercion” for allegedly pressuring Jenni Hermoso to justify his actions.,"MADRID: Spanish World Cup-winning star Jenni Hermoso told a judge on Tuesday that the kiss forced on her by former Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales was  “at no point consensual” and that she had come under pressure to defend his actions.
After arriving at the Audiencia Nacional in Madrid just before 10:00 am (0900 GMT), the 33-year-old went to testify before Judge Francisco de Jorge, who is investigating Rubiales on allegations of sexual assault and coercion.
“At the end of her declaration, she ratified the statement made at the public prosecutor’s office that the kiss was completely unexpected and at no point was it consensual,” a judicial source told AFP.
During the incident on Aug 20, the then head of Spain’s RFEF football federation held her head in both hands and forcibly kissed her on the lips after Spain won the World Cup in Australia.
He has said the act was  “a consensual peck” but Hermoso has insisted it was not.
She filed a lawsuit against him in September and told the judge she had come under pressure to defend Rubiales, both on the flight back from Australia and on a subsequent team holiday to Ibiza in the Balearic Islands.
“After the event, the situation experienced by the victim, both on the flight back to Spain and during her stay in Ibiza was one of constant harassment by the parties under investigation, which disrupted her normal life, causing her anxiety and distress,” the source said, quoting Hermoso’s testimony.
Under Spanish law, a non-consensual kiss can be considered sexual assault — a criminal category that groups all types of sexual violence.
Penalties for such a kiss range from a fine to four years in prison.
The 46-year-old Rubiales, who is subject to a restraining order banning him from being within 200 metres (yards) of Hermoso, is also accused of  “coercion” for allegedly pressuring her to justify his actions, which were broadcast live round the world.
The kiss provoked widespread outrage and prompted his suspension by world football governing body FIFA.
Rubiales appeared in court on Sept 15 and in October.
The judge quizzed three others over allegations they also pressured Hermoso — former women’s coach Jorge Vilda, men’s team director Albert Luque and RFEF marketing boss Ruben Rivera.
Numerous other witnesses have testified in court over the pressure faced by Hermoso, among them two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas and two other Spanish team-mates.

2,Nadal roars to win over Thiem in Brisbane singles comeback,"""I had enough work just to be focused and come back on court and remember how to play in a competitive match,"" says Nadal.","BRISBANE: Rafa Nadal marked his singles comeback after being out injured for nearly a year with a convincing 7-5, 6-1 victory over Austrian for­mer world number three Dominic Thiem in the Brisbane International first round on Tuesday. 
The 22-times Grand Slam champion had arthroscopic surgery last June after injuring his left hip flexor during his second round defeat by Mackenzie McDonald at the Australian Open in early 2023. 
Nadal returned to competitive tennis in the new season on Sunday and crashed to a doubles defeat while partnering retired veteran Marc Lopez but showed glimpses of his top form ahead of the Jan 14-28 Melbourne Park major. 
He will now play Jason Kubler in the second round after the Australian wildcard progressed when Aslan Kara­­tsev was forced to withdraw injured with the scores locked at one set apiece. 
“Today is honestly an emotional and important day for me after probably one of the toughest years of my tennis career,” Nadal said. “I had the chance to come back after a year and play in front of an amazing crowd and play at a very positive level on the first day is something that makes us feel proud.” 
Nadal spent time at his academy in Kuwait to prepare for the Australian summer and trained there with fast-rising French teen Arthur Fils. 
He looked like he had never been away as he lost only six points on serve throughout the match and made few unforced errors in an almost perfect display against a quality opponent. 
Nadal’s 1,069th men’s tour-level victory meant he surpassed Ivan Lendl to sit fourth in the all-time list. 
“As you can imagine, today it wasn’t a statistic I was aware of,” Nadal said. “I had enough work just to be focused and come back on court and remember how to play in a competitive match. There were nerves and doubts before the match. But things went well and I’m excited to be back.” 
Earlier, fifth-seeded Ameri­can Sebastian Korda and Argentinian sixth seed Sebas­tian Baez both crashed out. 
Germany’s Yannick Hanfmann downed Korda 7-5, 6-4 while Baez lost to Lukas Klein, with the Slovakian qualifier winning 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
In the women’s draw, former world number one Victoria Azarenka came back from second set jitters to see off Russia’s Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 7-6 (10/8), while Sofia Kenin, a former Australian Open winner, was stunned by Australian wildcard Arina Rodionova 7-5, 7-6 (9/7). 
US Open holder Coco Gauff started her new season with a victory at the Auckland Classic as the 19-year-old defending champion beat fellow American Claire Liu 6-4, 6-2. 
Gauff, who is looking to improve on last year’s fourth-round finish at the Melbourne Park, next plays world number 117 Brenda Fruhvirtova after the Czech 16-year-old defeated Anna Blinkova 7-5, 6-4. 
Second seed Elina Svitolina eased to a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Caroline Wozniacki and next meets 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu who returned following wrist and ankle surgeries to beat Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.

3,Suspects in Kenya court over Ugandan athlete’s murder,NAIROBI: Two suspects appeared in a Kenyan court on Tuesday over the murder of Ugandan Olympic athlete Benja­min...,"NAIROBI: Two suspects appeared in a Kenyan court on Tuesday over the murder of Ugandan Olympic athlete Benja­min Kiplagat who was found dead at the weekend with a stab wound to his neck.
The two men were ordered detained for 21 days by a magistrate’s court in the 
Rift Valley town of Eldoret to enable pol­ice to continue investigations into the killing of the 34-year-old Kiplagat.
The suspects, identified in court documents as David Ekhai Lokere (alias Timo), aged 25, and Peter Ushuru Khalumi, 30, were arrested on Monday.
Kiplagat’s body was discovered on a road on the outskirts of Eldoret in the early hours of Sunday morning with a stab wound to his neck.
While the motive of the killing was still unknown, police said investigations had 
shown that Kiplagat had been  “waylaid” by the two men before he hit their motorcycle with his car.
“The two suspects are known criminals who have been terrorising the members of public,” local police commander Stephen Okal told AFP on Monday.
Kenyan-born Kiplagat had represented Uganda internationally in the 3,000m steeplechase, including at three Olympic Games and six World Championships.
He won the silver medal in the 3,000m steeplechase at the 2008 World Junior Cham­pionships and bronze at the Africa Championships in 2012.
He made the semi-finals of the event in the 2012 Olympics in London and also competed in Rio in 2016.
The Uganda Athletics Federation on Monday issued a statement expressing its  “profound sadness and grief” at Kiplagat’s death.

6,Trott to continue as Afghanistan head coach in 2024,Afghanistan will play three 20-overs matches in India later this month.,"KABUL: Former England batter Jonathan Trott has signed a contract extension as Afghanistan head coach following their remarkable World Cup campaign in India.
Afghanistan finished sixth of 10 teams at the 50-overs World Cup where they registered upset wins over former winners Eng­land, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and came close to humbling eventual champions Australia.
The 42-year-old, who has signed an extension to the end of the year, also oversaw Afghanistan’s T20 series victory against Pak­is­tan and a one-day series win against Bangladesh in his first stint.
“The decision comes in after his successful 18-month tenure, during which he made significant contributions to the teams progress and development,” the Afghanistan Cricket Board said in a statement on Monday.
“Mr. Jonathan Trott expressed his pleasure on the extension of his contract and stated that he is looking forward to spending more time with the squad and building on performances of the recently held Cricket World Cup 2023.”
Afghanistan, currently playing a T20 series in the United Arab Emirates against the home side, will play three 20-overs matches in India later this month.
Trott will then look to get his team playing the same brand of fearless cricket at the T20 World Cup in June in the United States and West Indies.

7,Salah scores twice as Liverpool move three points clear atop EPL,LIVERPOOL: Mohamed Salah’s second-half brace made up for a missed penalty as Liverpool kicked off the new year...,"LIVERPOOL: Mohamed Salah’s second-half brace made up for a missed penalty as Liverpool kicked off the new year three points clear atop the Premier League standings with a 4-2 victory over Newcastle United at a rain-drenched Anfield on Monday. 
Juergen Klopp’s team, who began the day level with Aston Villa on points, now have 45 from 20 games. Villa have 42 points while Manchester City, who have played one fewer game, are third on 40. 
“It was a sensational game from my team,” Klopp told BBC. “We started extremely lively. Super game. I loved so many aspects of the game bar the goals we conceded. “Unbelievable atmosphere. Counter-pressing wise it was for football schools. They have to watch that, take it and keep it. It was everything good.” 
Newcastle, by contrast, remain down in ninth and 11 points off the top four as the spotlight grows on Eddie Howe. 
The Magpies have the second worst away record in the Premier League this season with just five points from 10 games. 
Howe’s men were fortunate not to be blown away by an embarrassing scoreline in stormy conditions at Anfield as Liverpool registered the highest expected goals ever in a Premier League game of 7.53. 
“We’re battling to get our best levels back. The effort and determination was there. As long as we continue to see that we’ll be fine,” said Howe. “We’re missing a lot of players and we’ve had a lot of tough fixtures in a congested December.” 
The 31-year-old Salah, who has 151 Premier League goals for Liverpool, changed his boots at halftime and the switch paid off handsomely. His two goals moved him even with City’s Erling Haaland as joint top scorers with 14 goals. He is the joint top on assists, level with Villa’s Ollie Watkins on eight. 
Liverpool dominated the game, and Salah, who had fired a first-half penalty straight at goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, finally broke the deadlock in the 49th minute when Darwin Nunez cut the ball across to the Egyptian for a close-range finish. 
Alexander Isak scored against the run of play with Newcastle’s second shot of the game in the 54th minute when he ran onto a through ball from Anthony Gordon and knocked it past keeper Alisson into the far corner. 
However, Curtis Jones put the home side back in front in the 74th minute with a tap-in after a pass across goal from Diogo Jota, and Cody Gakpo’s scuffed finish from Salah’s cross wrong-footed Dubravka four minutes later. 
Sven Botman’s header pulled one back for Newcastle in the 81st before Salah, who was playing his last game before departing for the African Cup of Nations, struck from the penalty spot after Jota had been fouled by Dubravka to seal the win in the 86th. 
“It’s a great result for us. The game was very intense and we managed to pick up three points and now we are top of the table. We need to stay calm and win every game,” Salah told Sky Sports. “The players spoke in the dressing room [at halftime]. ‘We have to stay calm’. I missed the pen. I didn’t want to leave for the national team with that performance.”

8,Elgar saddened by decline of Test cricket in South Africa,"CAPE TOWN: On the eve of his 86th and final Test match, Dean Elgar said he was “sad” South Africa would be...","CAPE TOWN: On the eve of his 86th and final Test match, Dean Elgar said he was “sad” South Africa would be sending a weakened team to play two Test matches in New Zealand in March. 
“The situation we’ve been put in is not ideal,” Elgar said on Tuesday, on the eve of the second Test against India at Newlands, where he will captain South Africa in his last match before retiring from international cricket. 
Only two of the players who won the first Test by an innings last week will be travelling to New Zealand — the result of a decision by Cricket South Africa to prioritise the SA20 franchise competition. 
“Irrespective of what has happened behind the scenes there is still a lot of hunger [for Test cricket] from the guys who are playing,” he said. 
Elgar said the positive from the situation was that it was an opportunity “for the guys going to New Zealand to put in performances and to eventually become regular members of the squad.” 
But he quickly said the decision to put the Twenty20 league ahead of Tests had nothing to do with the players. 
“What happens behind the scenes is totally out of our control. It’s out of our hands, the coaches’ hands, the team management’s hands,” said the 36-year-old. “It’s sad that it’s gone in that direction. As players we don’t have control over that, we have to focus on what we can focus on.”
Elgar’s Indian counterpart Rohit Sharma said for him Test cricket was the ultimate format of the game. 
“Obviously for me, Test cricket is the ultimate challenge,” he said at his eve of match press conference. “You would want to see the best players playing in that format. 
“I don’t know what the discussions are in Cricket South Africa but from my perspective I think that the priority and a lot of thought should be given to Test cricket. Luckily we don’t have those kinds of problems in India at this point of time.” 
Sharma said all countries needed to promote Test cricket. 
“It’s something all countries need to protect and give importance to,” said the 36-year-old. “All the nations that are playing, it is their responsibility to keep it nice and entertaining and competitive.”
Elgar said it was up to cricket’s administrators “to make the right decisions for players and the longevity of our format, especially our Test format. “It’s up to players to go out and win and show the hunger for this format. As long as I’m around I’m going to be a Test fanatic and I think a lot of our guys are Test fanatics.” 
Former Australia captain Steve Waugh said South Africa’s decision to send a shadow side to New Zealand shows the longest format of the game is under threat. 
Waugh said the governing International Cricket Council (ICC) and other administrators should step in to protect Test cricket. 
“Obviously they don’t care,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. “If I was New Zealand I wouldn’t even play the series. I don’t know why they’re even playing. Why would you when it shows a lack of respect for New Zealand cricket? 
“If the ICC or someone doesn’t step in shortly then Test cricket doesn’t become test cricket because you’re not testing yourself against the best players.” 
The ICC has little role in scheduling bilateral cricket or domestic T20 leagues, which is done by the boards involved. Its chairman, Greg Barclay, previously told the BBC “there’s not a lot we can do” about T20 leagues dominating the calendar. 
The proliferation of franchise cricket has put the squeeze on bilateral tours in recent years with West Indies in particular struggling to put together their strongest squad. 
The CSA cancelled a tour of Australia scheduled early last year to ensure the presence of their top players in the inaugural edition of the SA T20, which is bankrolled by the Indian Premier League franchises. 
Australia captain Pat Cummins hoped South Africa’s decision did not signal a drift away from Test cricket. 
“I know the South African team aren’t sending their strongest side, I’m hoping it’s just a phase,” Cummins told reporters in Sydney on the eve of the third Test against Pakistan. 
“I don’t think it’s as dramatic decline as it sometimes gets spoken about, but I think there is an issue just with the amount of other cricket out there.” 
Pakistan captain Shan Masood said the situation could have been avoided by better scheduling. 
“All the best sides have to play for the World Test Championship, so it’s a pity that South Africa aren’t being able to send their full-strength squad,” the batter said. “Hopefully somewhere down the line, schedules can be made in a certain way where we see the strongest elevens playing Test cricket.”

9,Pakistan rest Shaheen as Australia eye clean sweep in Warner Week,SYDNEY: Australia will go for the tried and tested as they look to sweep Pakistan in their three-match series and...,"SYDNEY: Australia will go for the tried and tested as they look to sweep Pakistan in their three-match series and send veteran opener David Warner out a winner at his home ground in his final Test this week. 
Pat Cummins confirmed on Tuesday that the same team that won the first test in Perth by 360 runs and a tense second in Melbourne by 79 runs would take the field for the final clash at Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. 
Pakistan have made two changes. There is a Test debut for Saim Ayub, who will open the innings replacing Imam-ul-Haq while senior fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been left out for off-spinner Sajid Khan with captain Shan Masood looking to motivate a team that was mauled in the opener and failed to exploit their opportunities to level the series in the second Test. 
Shan has already made it clear that he is a skipper who looks more on the positives and felt the fact that Pakistan had been competitive at times in Melbourne augured well. 
“You always have to look at the bigger picture after a game like the MCG,” Shan said on Tuesday. “I thought we played some very good cricket. But look, we’re playing the best side in the world ... and if you give them a sniff, they will pounce on any opportunities. 
“We’ve learned the lessons, at least we’ve put ourselves in those positions from where we could compete in or dominate games. We have to make sure that we’re not making a lot of mistakes to close out games, and if we can put in similar efforts to the one in Melbourne, we’ll be winning a lot of Tests.”  
With World Test Championship points to play for, Pakistan made the call to leave out pace spearhead Shaheen and to call in spinner Sajid. First-choice spinner Abrar Ahmed failed a fitness test and will return home without playing a Test on this tour.
Shan had earlier admitted Pakistan were keen to play two spinners in Sydney. 
“We think that it might turn in Sydney. So we want to give ourselves the best possible opportunity,” Shan said. “We’ve kept Abrar on the Australian tour. They have looked after him very well. His rehab process has been going very well. But we have to be absolutely sure he is close to 100% fit.” 
The call to drop Imam comes after the opener made scores of 62, 10, 10 and 12 in the first Two tests. In his place, 21-year-old Saim Ayub will make his test debut. 
In an expecting change to the fielding positions, Pakistan warmed up with Babar Azam in the slips on Tuesday and Abdullah Shafique not featuring in the cordon. Abdullah put down three chances at first slip in the opening two Tests. 
While Australia are planning a winning farewell for Warner, Shan said the tourists would be happy to play party poopers. 
“It’s a big occasion for him and the Australian cricket team but our job is to get David Warner out early,” he said. “But we wish him all the best with this test match and what’s to come forward for him as well.” 
Cummins said that Warner, who has sometimes divided opinion even in his own country, fully deserved to end his Test career on his own terms in his 112th match in the longest format. 
“Warner Week has started,” Cummins told reporters. “I think he’s our greatest three-form player. Three formats over a decade, two 50-over World Cups, one T20 World Cup and in all those campaigns he was front and centre and a big reason for it. 
“Playing more than 100 Tests puts him in an elite category in all three formats. Every time he walks out there, he’s competitive, ready to go, so just a champion of Australian sport and hopefully he gets a good send off this week.”   
Warner said on Monday that he would be also retiring from One-day Internationals, leaving a big gap at the top order for Australia to fill in two formats. 
The 37-year-old goes into his final Test having plundered 8,695 runs at an average of 44.58, with 26 centuries and 36 half-centuries. 
Cummins gave few clues as to who is leading the running to open for the two Tests against West Indies in January, although he did cite Warner’s current partner Usman Khawaja as an example of a non-specialist who forced his way into the team. 
The SCG has a reputation for taking turn, but the hosts did not consider bringing a second spinner into the team to partner Nathan Lyon, Cummins said. 
“The weather looks pretty good this week and that’s not always the case in Sydney,” Cummins said ahead of the Test, starting Wednesday. “The groundsman seems happy with where it’s at. It looks like decent coverage of grass, so it should be a good week ahead.” 
The Sydney Test has a history of being rain-affected with 26 washed out days, the most of the Australian Test venues. But there is only a medium chance of showers this week. 
Meanwhile, Warner made a public plea for the return of his baggy green caps after they went missing from his bag while being transported from Melbourne. 
In a post on Instagram, the veteran said some of his possessions got lost in transit. 
“Someone has taken my backpack out of my luggage from Melbo­urne to Sydney ... inside this backpack was my Baggy Green cap,” Warner said. “It’s something that I would love to have back in my hands walking out there this week.” 
But after months of speculation about his place in the team, Warner will get the send-off he desired in his home city after scores of 164, 0, 38 and six in the Pakistan series so far. 
“Best-case scenario is a [Warner] hundred and maybe a leg-spinner to take the last wicket of the game out of the rough,” Cummins said. “If he could score some runs and go off in style with a few fours and sixes, I think that’d be a pretty fitting end.”

Elgar, 36, is retiring from international cricket after the brief series and will captain the side in the place of injured Temba Bavuma as South Africa chase a 2-0 series victory after winning the first Test by an innings and 32 runs in Centurion.
“It’s business as usual for us. It’s a massive test for us, obviously our highlight Test match of the year, the New Year’s Test at Newlands and it doesn’t get much bigger and better than against really tough opposition in India,” Elgar told a press conference on Tuesday.
Elgar was named man-of-the-match after scoring 185 in the first innings of the opening Test and is key to home hopes of winning again.
“I’m not too focused on what’s going on behind the scenes around myself. It is what it is, and every player who has retired before has gone through much the same thing. For me, it’s another game and we’ll worry about the retirement afterwards.”
Elgar said South Africa had been determined to make a positive start to the series and now seek to finish it off in similar style.
“It being a two-match series, we knew we couldn’t afford to start slowly, unlike some of our series in the past. We really played well [in Centurion] and it was probably the perfect Test, except for some of the catching,” he said. “There are quite a lot of young and inexperienced players in our team but they have a great opportunity. Tomorrow, we need to obviously throw the first punch and we’ve talked about the position we’re in and the occasion.”
Injury to Bavuma provides Elgar with the captaincy in his final Test, a fortuitous turn of events after being replaced as skipper 10 months ago.
“I don’t think you get a bigger accolade or bigger credit from a playing point of view in your career than to be asked to captain your side,” he said.
“I did it in the past for a year and a half and it was probably the best learning experience for me as an individual, not just from cricket but off the field too,” he added.
Regarding the second Test, Elgar said it was important to focus on the match and not his personal situation.
“It’s a massive Test for us, our highlight Test of the year,” said Elgar, who has been linked with English county sides Somerset and Essex.
“We have another game where we have to make a solid start. We’ll worry about the retirement afterwards.”
South Africa’s young side can expect something of a backlash in conditions that will be a little less intimidating than in Centurion and where a chastised Indian side have promised a better performance.
South Africa are unbeaten in six pre­vious Tests at Newlands against India.
Meanwhile, Indian captain Rohit Sharma fended off home criticism by pointing out previous success away from home.
“We might have put in this performance here, but don’t forget what we did in Australia and England,” he said. “We won the series in Australia on the back of our batting. We drew the series in England through our batting and bowling both. These performances can happen. It doesn’t mean we don’t know how to bat outside India.
“Sometimes the opposition per­for­ms better than us,” he said.
Rohit said his young batsmen will simply have to find a way to cope with the “challenging” conditions.
The Indian captain said he did not expect conditions for the second Test to be much different from those at Centurion.
“The pitch looks pretty similar to Centurion,” he said. “Maybe not full of grass but there is enough covering of grass on the pitch.”
Rohit added that team-mates who were in Cape Town said conditions appeared to be much as they were then, when the highest team total in a tightly-contested match, won by South Africa, was 223.
Three of India’s top six batsmen are on their first tour of South Africa and they all struggled at Centurion. Rohit said they would have benefitted from the first game.
“At some stage we all have to be exposed to conditions like this,” he said. “I am sure they will have learned a lot from the first game and tomorrow is another opportunity for them.”
In the mean time, Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has returned to full fitness after missing the first Test with back spasms and could be in line for selection.

11,Yasir confident Pakistan have all it takes to win New Zealand T20 series,LAHORE: Pakistan have all they need in terms of resources to emerge as winners of their upcoming five-match Twenty20...,"LAHORE: Pakistan have all they need in terms of resources to emerge as winners of their upcoming five-match Twenty20 International series against New Zealand, but hard work would be key, the team’s high-performance coach Yasir Arafat said on Tuesday.
The series mark the commencement of Pakistan’s build-up towards the next edition of the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June this year.The national selectors, therefore, have picked up a squad featuring a number of players who have impressed in domestic cricket recently along with the core of regular players including newly-appointed skipper and pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi.
The roster includes the likes of flamboyant mainstays in top-order batter Fakhar Zaman and batting all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed and domestic high-performers in batters Sahibzada Farhan and Haseebullah Khan. 
“Our side is well balanced and we have a few exciting cricketers at our disposal,” Yasir said during a media talk on the sidelines of the final day of Pakistan’s six-day preparatory camp for the New Zealand series on Tuesday. 
“… like Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmad and new boys Sahibzada Farhan and Haseebullah, while many good players are in Australia as well.
“All of them have a few good performances on their back.”
In Australia are the ones who are featuring in Pakistan’s ongoing three-match Test series against the hosts, who hold an unassailable 2-0 lead.
The training camp was attended by players who were neither in the Test squad nor they were playing the on-going Big Bash League Down Under. A few players, who had performed in the recent National T20 Cup were also invited to the camp, despite not being picked for the New Zealand series. 
“The boys have worked very hard in the training camp and if they apply what they have learned here, they may well go onto beat New Zealand in New Zealand,” claimed Yasir.it will be pivotal
to beat New Zealand in New Zealand,” said Yasir, who holds the England and Wales Cricket Board Level IV certification from the Loughborough University. While Yasir’s international career hasn’t been an illustrious one, his coaching ideas revolve around modern day cricket.
The former all-rounder believed Pakistan’s last appearance in New Zealand — a triangular T20 series win in November-December 2022 — proved the team was well-equipped to win the upcoming series, which runs from Jan 12-21 as well. 
“Pakistan had played a triangular series in New Zealand before the last ICC T20 World Cup and won it with Bangladesh and New Zealand as
the other contenders, so, we have a good past and bunch of the players to topple New Zealand,” he said.
The series will be Pakistan’s first white-ball outing since their unsuccessful campaign in the 50-over World Cup, of which the side failed to make the semi-finals. Yasir believed the debacle should be treated as the past and nothing more.
“Many other teams also played badly [in the World Cup] but now they are planning for the future,’ said the 41-year-old. “Pakistan should do the same.” 
One of the players who haven’t been selected in the squad but has been called up for the camp is Pakistan discard Ahmed Shehzad, who had recently expressed dejection over going unpicked for the next season of the HBL Pakistan Super League despite putting up a decent show in the National T20 Cup.Yasir acknowledged Ahmed’s recent performances and claimed that he urged the opener to keep fighting for a place in the national side.
“We did a good number of drills during the camp and Ahmed Shehzad did those all with full focus on that and my message to him is to
keep continuing his performances to put pressure on the selectors,” he said. 
“My motto is to give maximum opportunity to those players who have been ignored despite their performances. 
“It is our habit that we do not appreciate players enough and criticise them for their shortcomings.”

12,Imad to lead Pakistan in Olympic qualifier,ISLAMABAD: Imad Shakeel Butt will lead Pakistan in the forthcoming Olympic qualifier in Oman as the national...,"ISLAMABAD: Imad Shakeel Butt will lead Pakistan in the forthcoming Olympic qualifier in Oman as the national selection committee on Tuesday announced an 18-member national squad for the important event.
Defender Abu Bakr Mahmood was named vice-captain of the squad for the Jan 15-21 event featuring teams from eight countries.
Head coach Olympian Shahnaz Sheikh sounded optimistic about Pakistan qualifying for the Olympics.
Speaking to Dawn following the announcement of the team, the head coach said that the squad looked very balanced and was a mixture of junior and senior players.
“We have 10 players who played the Junior World Cup while the selection committee [also] picked eight senior players,” Shahnaz said, adding that all the players had been given best training during the national camp.
“We hope that we will not only qualify for the Olympics but will also win this qualifying round [in Oman] as well.”
The participating teams in the Oman event are divided into two groups. Pakistan are placed in pool ‘A’ alongside England, Malaysia and China while pool ‘B’ comprises Germany, New Zealand, Canada and Chile.
