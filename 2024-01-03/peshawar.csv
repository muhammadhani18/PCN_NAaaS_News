He said the local office-bearers proposed Mufti Kifayatullah for nomination in the constituency as he was a former MPA and was the strongest among ticket aspirants but the board named Fahad Habib as the candidate.
JUI-F general secretary Mohammad Fayyaz, who belongs to the same union council, warned the party would suffer a setback in the Feb 8 election due to the “wrong” nomination of Mr Habib, who was contesting for the key PK-38 seat for the first time.

Warn party will suffer setback in election

Tehsil councillor Obaidullah Aslam Khan, who is also the parliamentary leader of the JUI-F in Mansehra tehsil council, also resigned from his position.
He said the party’s leadership should give due importance to its workers and local body members while taking decisions.

STRIKE: Traders on Tuesday observed a complete shutter-down strike and blocked roads to traffic complaining about the shortage of doctors and other medical staff at the civil hospital in Darband.
The protesters staged a sit-in outside the hospital after marching on roads.
Holding banners and placards, they shouted slogans against the DHO and health department over a long delay in the immediate filling of hospital vacancies.
The sit-in led to traffic disruption between Darband and Oghi for long hours.
Local prayer leader Maulana Kaleem, who led the protest, said the district health officer wasn’t bothered about poor patient care and lack of facilities at the civil hospital and other health facilities in the district.
Darband tehsil council chairman Dilbar Khan said various delegations of local councillors, traders and people met district health officer Sardar Mushtaq and sought resolution of health issues, but to no avail.
“This sit-in will continue until our demands are met and vacant posts of doctors, including women, paramedics and technicians are filled,” he said.
Councillor Habib Basikhel said the people had been staging street protests for a long time but authorities hadn’t filled vacancies.

7,Police warn Fazl’s son of possible terrorist attack,"There are threats that terrorists might target Maulana Asad during travelling or at his residence, police say.","ISLAMABAD: Police in Dera Ismail Khan have warned former federal minister Maulana Asad Mahmood, the son of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, of possible terrorist attack and advised him to restrict his movement and to keep it secret.
The advisory issued by Saleem Khan, the sub-division police officer (SDPO), Saddar Circle, DI Khan, to former federal minister for communications Maulana Asad Mahmood said that there were threats that terrorists might target him during travelling or at his residence.
“Under these circumstances, avoid unnecessary travel and appearances at gatherings, while keep your movements secret and keep them under limitations,” said the advisory.
It said that not only Maulana Asad needed to keep his security at high alert, but he should also inform security agencies about his movement to prevent any untoward incident.
The copy of the advisory has been forwarded to district police officer of Dera Ismail Khan.
JUI-F has reacted sharply to the advisory issued by the police and its spokesperson Aslam Ghori has said that it seems that the key performance of police and district administration is to issue advisories and notices.
“Just issuance of notices and advisories does not fulfil the responsibility of administration and police department. Their key responsibility is to the contain terror,” he said.
Mr Ghori said that such notices were being issued almost daily but administration, Election Commission of Pakistan and judiciary did not care about the issues of security.
“Politicians have to be in public as elections are approaching. Should we understand that there is some conspiracy behind the news about terrorism? When we talk about peace and law and order issue the chief election commission makes non-serious comments,” he said.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazalur Rehman had told a news conference last week that district administrations was telling political parties that they faced dangerous security situation.
He had warned that if any worker of JUI-F was harmed in terror attack during the election process, chief election commissioner and chief justice would be held responsible. Two days later, his convey came under attack in Dera Ismail Khan, however, no loss of life was reported.

8,PHC seeks details of criminal cases against Murad Saeed,Puts law-enforcement agencies on notice over petition filed by PTI leader’s father,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday directed the police and other law-enforcement agencies to produce details within a week of the criminal cases registered against former federal minister and PTI leader Murad Saeed, who is in hiding to escape his arrest.
Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan of a single-member benchissued notices to the respondents, including KP chief secretary, its inspector general of police, directors general of the National Accountability Bureau and Federal Investigation Agency, and provincial anti-corruption establishment’s director, seeking their respective response to a petition filed by Murad Saeed’s father, Saeedullah, to seek details of “any FIR registered against his son as well as of any order” for his detention under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance.
Advocate Shah Faisal Uthmankhel appeared for the petitioner and contended that his client tried his best to get information about the cases against his son, but the respondents flatly refused to share any information about it.
He said Murad Saeed, who had gone into hiding, had tried his level best to approach the competent court of law for getting legal remedies but the local police had blocked all his ways to approach the relevant courts.

Puts law-enforcement agencies on notice over petition filed by PTI leader’s father

The lawyer contended that the provincial care-taker government through the police and other agencies was bent upon to willfully violate the constitution and had been harassing the petitioner’s son and other family members by conducting raids on their residences and hujras. He contended that after the removal of the PTI’s government in the centre in April 2022, 
“concocted” cases were registered against party leaders, including Murad Saeed.
Mr Uthmankhel requested the bench to grant interim relief to the petitioner and order authorities not to arrest his son in any of the cases registered against him until further orders.
However, the bench wondered how such an interim order could be issued when the number and details of cases registered against the petitioner’s son were not known.
The judge observed that an earlier order of the court against the arrest of a petitioner in any of the cases was suspended by the Supreme Court.
Additional advocate general Danyal Asad Chamkani argued that earlier, a petition was filed on behalf of Mr Saeed but the high court ruled that as no power of attorney was submitted on his behalf, the sought-after relief couldn’t be extended to him.
He wondered how relief could be provided to an accused when he was not present before the court.
POLICE STOPPED FROM ARRESTS: The bench also ordered the local police not to arrest several key leaders of the PTI’s lawyers’ wing, Insaf lawyers Forum, who feared arrest over their heated exchanges and scuffle with the police outside the high court a day ago.
The bench sought comments within 10 days from the provincial government, KP IGP and several other police officials in a petition filed by the ILF leaders requesting the court to order removal of a heavy police force deputed outside the PHC and the district courts, which they claimed were harassing the petitioners.
It also ordered the police to provide details of the FIRs, if any, registered against the petitioners.
Advocates Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, Mashal Azam, Mohammad Azam Khan, Malik Shahab, Inam Khan Yousafzai and Amir Zeb appeared in the case and said a day ago, a large police contingent deployed outside the high court harassed several of them as they helped party leaders file appeals with the election appellate tribunal.
They claimed that they learned that the officials of the East Cantonment police station had registered a report in the daily diary against the petitioners accusing them of interfering in their official work.
The lawyers feared that the report would be converted into an FIR and they would be arrested by the police.
The petitioners also said one of them was chased and harassed outside the high court by officials of the excise and taxation and anti-narcotics department.
The bench directed the excise department’s DG to appear before it on next hearing and explain his position on the matter.

Speaking at a press conference, he said his party’s competition in elections would be with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. “Those who want the elections delayed over security reasons should sit at home,” he said without naming JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who recently said it was not a big issue if elections were delayed.
Mr Khattak said preparations of his party for the elections were in full swing.
He said he was in good terms with the leadership of all political parties, so it was not possible for him to do seat adjustment at one seat of the provincial or National Assembly and contest elections against the same party on the other seats.
“Seat adjustment would be politically harmful for any political party,” he said. He further said if he had fielded candidates at any provincial and National Assembly constituency then how it was possible to do seat adjustment with the other political parties.

11,"Govt to cut textbook size, provide old books to half of schoolchildren",Hopes move will save over Rs3bn for printing books.,"PESHAWAR: The cash-strapped Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to reduce the size of textbooks and provide half of the schoolchildren with old course books hoping the exercise will save over Rs3 billion for printing books.
The decision was made in the last cabinet meeting, according to officials.
They told Dawn that in the last three years, the provincial government didn’t release the funds required by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Textbook Board to publish course books due to financial constraints.
The officials said the government provided books to the students of its schools free of charge.
They said the printing of books in the upcoming academic year 2023-24 was likely to cost Rs8.528 billion but the amount will go down to Rs5.247 billion by cutting the size of textbooks and providing 50 per cent of schoolchildren with the books that were collected from the students after their promotion to next grades.

Hopes move will save over Rs3bn for printing books

The official documents show that the 6-12 graders would utilise 50 per cent of old books to be collected by schools from students promoted to next grades.
Only the books in good condition will be given away to students with the move saving the government Rs1.8 billion, according to the documents.
The students of grade 4-5 will use 20 per cent of the old books saving the government Rs334 million.
Officials told Dawn that besides reducing textbook size, the government had also decided to reduce the size of nursery-grade 12 course books leading to a government saving of Rs1.11 billion.
Sources in the education department insisted that the government’s decision violated the standard textbook size set by the Single National Curriculum introduced by the last Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
They, however, said the move to downsize textbooks and distribute old books to schoolchildren came “under compulsion” as the finance department didn’t release funds for printing textbooks to the board on time.
Officials in the textbook board told Dawn that private companies printed books for the academic year 2022-23 at a cost of Rs10 billion but the provincial government made payments to them in piecemeal.
They said though the board had started bidding for books printing for the next year, the finance department hadn’t made full payment to publishers for the work they did last year. The officials said out of Rs10 billion cost of printing books last year, the finance department had so far released Rs8 billion.
The officials said the delay in the release of funds had disillusioned printers, who were no longer taking interest in the textbook printing bidding for the next academic year slated to start in April 2024.
They said the textbook floated a tender in Oct last year for books printing but no printers submitted proposals fearing that the cash-strapped KP government won’t be able to pay them for printing books.
The officials said they extended the tender date time and again, but in vain.
They said they floated the tender for the second time and its opening date was fixed on Dec 13 but no one among the printers turned up and the textbook board was compelled to extend its opening to Dec 20. They said that the bidding process was in progress.
Sources feared a two months learning loss for schoolchildren in the next academic year saying the publishers won’t be able to deliver orders by the end of May.

13,Former PHC CJ Rashid dies after days in coma,Laid to rest in his Malakand village,"


 
PESHAWAR: Former Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan died at a hospital here on Tuesday a few days after falling into a coma.
The 62-year-old was laid to rest in his ancestral village Thana in Malakand district after his funeral prayers were by people from different walks of life, including judges, lawyers, and high court staff members, in large numbers.
The deceased, who retired as the high court’s chief justice on March 30, 2023, suffered from a kidney issue and a massive stroke sank him into a coma a few days ago. He was admitted at a local hospital where he breathed his last.
Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, other judges, principal officers and staff members expressed grief over the death and prayed for the deceased.
Mr Qaiser was elevated from the bar and appointed an additional judge of the high court on Aug 2, 2011. He was confirmed as a high court judge afterwards.
He served in the high court for around 12 years.
The death of Chief Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth led to the appointment of Justice Qaiser as the acting CJ on Nov 16, 2020. He was made the regular CJ on Jan 9, 2021.

Laid to rest in his Malakand village

Justice Qaiser was born on March 31, 1961, in Thana area of Malakand district.
He was a leading figure from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the 2007-09 lawyers’ movement for judicial independence and was the first lawyer to be arrested after the imposition of an emergency rule in the country on Nov 3, 2007, by the then military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf.
He was sent to the Dera Ismail Khan Central Prison under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance.
Justice Qaiser was popular among lawyers, so he was elected a member of the KP Bar Council for two consecutive terms in Nov 1988 and April 2004. He became a member of the Pakistan Bar Council on Dec 22, 2010, after getting the highest votes among elected members across the country.
Justice Qaiser also remained the additional advocate general of the province from March 17, 2008, to his resignation on March 25, 2010.
He graduated from the historical Islamia College, Peshawar, in 1981 and got his law degree from the Khyber Law College, Peshawar, in 1984.
Mr Qaiser got master’s degrees in political science and journalism from the University of Peshawar in 1987 and 1991, respectively. He was enrolled as an advocate of lower courts in 1984 and that of the high court and Supreme Court in 1991 and 2008, respectively.
As a high court judge and chief justice, he was known for taking keen interest in the issues of public interest, especially healthcare, education, forestry, human rights, tourism and environment.
He had to his credit the introduction of a law to limit schoolbag weight as he, leading a two-member bench, ordered the government in April 2019 to legislate on the matter.
Justice Qaiser also issued orders on different occasions for the removal of mobile phone base transceiver stations over threats to human health due to their installation near populated areas. He also ordered the Federal Investigation Agency and KP Health Care Commission to crack down on illegal human organ transplantation and quackery.

15,"Sherpao fears poor law, order to affect voter turnout in polls",QWP chief says politicians will have to join hands for overcoming challenges.,"CHARSADDA: Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) chairman Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao said here on Tuesday that voters would face difficulties in reaching polling stations owing to the prevailing poor law and order.
Addressing a gathering in Tangi tehsil, he said that candidates would also face problems in running their election campaign. On this occasion, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf nazim Mohammad Nisar Khan announced joining QWP along with his family members and supporters.
Mr Sherpao said that law and order was getting worse with each passing day. He said that political forces would have to join hands and work hard to steer the country out of the prevailing crises.
He said that the country faced three major challenges of political instability, economic crisis and rising acts of terrorism in the year 2023. He said any political party, which would come to power after the 2024 general elections, would have to work hard to address those challenges.

QWP chief says politicians will have to join hands for overcoming challenges

The QWP chief said that the people demanding level playing field should recall whether it was provided to other political parties during the 2018 general elections. He said that experiments with the political system caused colossal loss to national economy, therefore, such practices should be stopped.
He said that the experiment to bring Imran Khan to power caused economic stagnation, inflation and political instability. “What service was done to the country by bringing him to power” he questioned.
Mr Sherpao said that voters must not listen to catchy slogans as those were meant to deceive them. He advised the voters to check the track record of candidates before casting their ballots.
He said that nobody cared to raise voice for the rights of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which was facing financial crunch. He said that the cash-strapped province did not have funds to pay salaries to government employees. 
He said that provision of free treatment under Sehat card was also suspended for want of funds. He said that all uplift projects in the province were put on back burner.
FOG: Thick fog has engulfed the whole district for the last four days. It has paralysed routine life as the number of road accidents has increased and government employees face problems in reaching their places of duty. The traders are the worst sufferers as there is lack of customers in bazaars.
Most of the people remain indoors. A large number of locals suffer from multiple cold-related diseases. Farmers also face difficulties in making gur and cultivating wheat and other crops.
