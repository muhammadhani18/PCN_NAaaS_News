0,Screening for Covid variant increased on borders,Minister says JN.1 variant has been rep­o­rted in some countries and Pakistan is keeping an eye on developments.,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Health Minister Dr Nad­eem Jan has said a new variant of Covid-19 “JN.1 Omicron” has been rep­o­rted in some countries and Pakistan is keeping an eye on developments.
“We have been monitoring the situation. It is a sub-variant of the Omicron but has not been reported in Pakistan yet. I believe there will be fewer chan­ces that the virus would travel to Pakistan as we are vigilant but there is need to be more careful,” he claimed on Tuesday. “We have increased screening at international border and testing of the people. Moreover, provincial and district governments have been also directed to increase testing.”
Also, the National Insti­tute of Health on Tuesday issued a report claiming that 3,609 tests of Covid-19 were held during last week of which 16 samples were found positive, with no mortality. While the positivity rate was 0.44pc, there were no critical pat­ients of Covid-19.
On Dec 19, the WHO declared JN.1 “a variant of interest” due to its “rapidly increasing spread”.

1,Constitutional ‘contradiction’ puzzles CJP,CJ Isa wonders why art­icles 62 and 63 suggest different punishments for same offence by lawmakers.,"• CJ Isa wonders why art­icles 62 and 63 suggest different punishments for same offence by lawmakers
• Counsel terms 2018 ruling ‘incorrect’, says Article 62 dependent on Article 63
• Bench intends to wrap up case by Jan 11, says SC only concerned with legality, not political parties
ISLAMABAD: As the apex court expressed its intention to wrap up the proceedings of a case regarding disqualification of lawmakers by Jan 11, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa on Tuesday questioned why two similarly worded provisions of the Constitu­tion provided different punishments to parliamentarians for the same offence.
The CJP compared Art­icle 62(1)(f) and Article 63(1)(g) and said the former entailed a lifetime ban whereas the latter prescribed a five-year ban from parliament.
The CJP wondered why these provisions prescribed different punishments, even for committing acts which may be “prejudicial to the ideology of Pakistan or against the sovereignty, integrity or security of the country”.
These observations were made by the top judge as a seven-member bench took up a set of 15 petitions to determine wh­e­ther the disqualification period was five years or a lifetime ban. The Elections Act was amended to red­uce it to five years after a Supreme Court judgement in 2018 introduced a life ban for lawmakers over violation of the said article.
The Supreme Court also appointed senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, Uzair Karamat Bhandari, and legal adviser Reema Omar as amici to assist the court on the question of disqualification.
‘Court interested in 2018 verdict’
During the hearing, the court said it was more interested in arguments supporting the April 13, 2018 Supreme Court verdict in the Samiullah Baloch case which had shut the doors of parliament permanently for politicians disqualified under Article 62(1)(f).
Lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan, representing Jehangir Khan Tareen who was also disqualified under Article 62(1)(f), apprised the court that provisions relating to qualification and disqualifications of parliamentarians were introduced in the Constitution under Presidential Order 14 of 1985 through the Revival of the Constitution Order (RCO) by late military dictator Ziaul Haq.
“Is it not ironic that a per­son who violated his oath and destroyed the Con­stitution by holding it in abeyance…put forth these conditions,” the CJP wondered. “Was Zia a non-profligate?”
“These are the matters of divine judgement,” the counsel said, adding that if an individual had committed treason he could be elected to parliament after five years.
 
 

“Did Ziaul Haq commit treason by holding the Constitution in abeyance,” wondered Justice Isa.  “Could the constitution be amended through RCO? Ziaul Haq inserted the clauses on the character of individuals,” the CJP observed, also wondering whether Zia himself had a good character.
“This is ironic that those who come swearing to protect the Constitution break it themselves and then introduce amendments,” CJP Isa observed.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, however, added that articles 62 and 63 got a stamp of approval through the 18th Amendment, which was a democratic dispensation.
CJP Isa observed he would choose provisions provided by the original and pristine Con-stitution not amended by dictators in case a conflict arose between the provisions.
Makhdoom Ali Khan cited the Al-Jihad case to highlight that the judgement itself suggested that in case of such a conflict, the provision suggested by the original constitution should prevail.
Makhdoom Ali Khan argued that both articles 62 and 63 were inserted in the Constitution at the same time; therefore, both should be considered in relation to each other.
The counsel contended that the Supreme Court had incorrectly decided the Samiullah Baloch case by looking at the two provisions through different lenses and added that Article 62 was dependent on Article 63.
About the declaration by the court of law as suggested by Article 62(1)(f), it should be looked at with the standard set out in Section 42 of the Special Relief Act, the counsel said, adding that a negative declaration by the court of law was impossible to obtain.
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan supported Section 232(2) in the Election Act 2017 which prescribed disqualification for five years.
The AGP asked the court to revisit the Samiullah Baloch judgement since it contained certain contradictions. The advocates general also supported this contention.
According to the CJP, the Constitution did not mention the period of disqualification rather the gap was filled by the courts. Justice Shah wondered whether the period provided in sub-constitutional legislation — the Elections Act — was of greater importance than the Constitution. “This matter needed interpretation since under Article 63, a person who commits sedition could still contest the elections,” he added.
The chief justice wondered about the differences between articles 62 and 63 and asked how the character of an individual could be determined. “Your supporter may say you have an exemplary character while your detractors may say you have the worst,” he observed.
“According to Islamic teachings, no one can be said to have an exemplary character,” the CJP observed and added that even Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah would have faced disqualification according to these provisions.
He also observed that an impression should not be created that the case was being heard for or against a political party. “We are only concerned with the constitutionality and legality of the matter,” he stressed.

2,Court overstepped jurisdiction in ‘bat’ case: ECP lawyer,"Counsel says issues raised in party’s plea not subject to ""judicial review"".","• Counsel says issues raised in party’s plea not subject to ‘judicial review’
• Gohar says no plans to boycott elections, despite concerns
• PTI claims 700 nomination papers rejected
PESHAWAR / ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakis­tan’s (ECP) lawyers argued before the Peshawar High Court on Tues­day that its single-judge bench had overstepped its jurisdiction by suspending the commission’s declaration on PTI’s intra-party polls and the subsequent revocation of its election symbol ‘bat’.
Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan was informed by ECP lawyers that the commission was condemned unheard when another bench of the court granted interim relief to the PTI by suspending the ECP’s declaration on Dec 26. The bench after completion of their arguments iss­ued notices to the petitioners, inclu­ding  PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and six other leaders for today (Wednesday).
The bench was hearing a review application by the ECP requesting the court to recall its Dec 26 order as the bench had issued the same beyond its territorial jurisdiction. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel of the PHC had ordered a temporary suspension of the ECP’s decision, instructing the commission to publish PTI’s intra-party poll certificate on its website and restore the party’s election symbol. This said order is set to remain effective until Jan 9, 2024.
Advocates Sikander Bashir and Mohsin Kamran Siddique appeared for the ECP on Tuesday and stated that the writ petition of the PTI came up for hearing before the high court on Dec 26 and the court passed an interim order without issuing any notice to the ECP.
Sikander Bashir stated that the petitioners had sought interim relief for the suspension of the order of the commission of Dec 22, as well as for the publication of the intra-party polls certificate on the commission’s website along with the restoration of party’s symbol (bat). He argued that the interim order in fact decided the whole writ petition which amounted to granting the final relief.
“Under Article 199, the high court of a province is empowered to make an order directing a person performing within its territorial jurisdiction,” he argued.
He contended that the issues raised in the PTI’s writ petition were exclusively within the commission’s purview and generally not subject to judicial review under Article 199.
KP Advocate General Aamir Javed and Additional Attorney General Sanaullah Khan informed the bench the federal and KP governments were not party to the petition. Following the arguments, the bench observed that it would reserve an order. However, after a central leader of the Insaf lawyers Forum, Mashal Azam, turned up and stated that a notice had not been issued to the petitioners on the ECP’s application, the bench set the next hearing for today (Wednesday).
‘PTI will not boycott polls’
PTI Chairman Gohar Khan on Tuesday emphasised that despite serious concerns about the fairness of the electoral process, his party would not boycott the general elections. Mr Khan’s statement came after consultations with former prime minister Imran Khan at Adiala Jail.
Talking to journalists associated with international media outlets, Mr Khan asserted, “There is no plan to boycott the elections, had we planned to do so we would have already boycotted.”
He criticised the ECP for its decision to deprive the PTI of its traditional election symbol and added that the ECP’s move would have implications for the party’s share of women seats, its prospects in the elections of speakers, prime minister and chief ministers, and the Senate polls.
‘700 papers rejected’
Separately, PTI leader Hammad Azhar tweeted that the nomination papers of 700 party candidates in as many as 420 constituencies of national and provincial assemblies had been rejected during the scrutiny process.
 






Mr Azhar also shared a list with his ‘X’ post, saying the nomination papers of PTI candidates in almost 120 constituencies of the National Assembly and nearly 300 provincial assemblies had been rejected.
Separately, Advocate Naeem Ahmad Panjhota also filed an appeal in the appellate tribunal against the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-82, PP-71 and PP-88.

3,CJP seeks ‘once and for all’ solution to enforced disappearances,"ISLAMABAD: Descri­bing the issue as ‘serious’, Chief Jus­tice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa dropped hints on Tue­sday","ISLAMABAD: Descri­bing the issue as ‘serious’, Chief Jus­tice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa dropped hints on Tue­sday to resolve the chro­nic malaise of enforced disappearances “once and for all”, but insisted that the matter could be settled only if all accept responsibility.
“This country belongs to all of us. Even those who may have other viewpoints,” he observed while presiding over a case brought forward by Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan that highlighted how the unlawful practice of enf­orced disappearances continued unabated, haunting generations upon generations.
“Let’s make Pakistan str­ong from within,” Justice Isa said, adding that no outside forces could harm it if the country was strong from within.
The court, before adjourning until Wednesday (today), requested Mr Ahsan’s counsel, Shoaib Shaheen, to present concise points on potential legal actions regarding enforced disappearances.
Justice Isa emphasised that the present case held great public importance and that the court intended to resolve the matter for good.
The CJP, who was heading a three-judge bench, also including Justice Muham­mad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali, observed that many of the individuals cited in the petition were influential figures capable of directly approaching the court, yet none had done so. He also noted that many of the mentioned individuals had reappeared without identifying those responsible for their disappearances.
The Supreme Court cautioned against using the judiciary as a platform for political gains, referencing the precedent set in the Faizabad Dharna case, which upheld the right to peaceful protest.
The counsel, however, insisted on the court’s recognition of enforced disappearances as violations of several constitutional articles. 
He also highlighted the inadequacy of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances in meeting legal and international standards.
The petition mentioned the names of political activists, namely Usman Dar, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Azam Khan, Mohammad Khan Bhatti, etc., all belonging or allied with the PTI. They were allegedly abducted and coerced into changing political loyalties.
Addressing the case of Mr Ahmed, the CJP said that he was not an underprivileged person, and if a person like him could not come to the Supreme Court, then no one else could.
Justice Isa also wondered whether the petitioner’s real grievance was that those disappeared had switched sides. “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen,” he mused.
The discussion also turned to a bill on missing persons presented by former human rights minister Shereen Mazari before the Senate, which later went missing. The chief justice expressed surprise over the disappearance of the bill from the Senate, particularly as it occurred during PTI’s time in power.
“It is strange that a minister is saying her bill disappeared,” Justice Isa wondered, adding that the “missing persons case” had now become a “missing bill case”.
Besides, the counsel had pointed fingers against Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani without making him party in the case, Justice Isa said.
When the counsel cited the name of anchorperson Imran Riaz Khan — who had resurfaced after four months of disappearance — the CJP wondered why the petitioner did not mention journalists like Matiullah Jan and Asad Toor, who still stood with what they claimed about their disappearances. “We will ask questions once you pick and choose,” Justice Isa observed.
Mr Shaheen then highlighted the case of Dr Deen Muhammad Baloch, who had been missing from Balochistan for 14 years. He said Baloch students had been subjected to short-term disappearances, being picked up, kept in secret detention facilities and released several days later.
Justice Isa expressed his surprise that the petitioner failed to mention a sit-in in Islamabad over missing persons, but the counsel said the petition was filed much before the protest started. “You could have filed another petition. This way, the facts could have come before us,” Justice Isa said.
He observed that a detailed list of missing persons should have been provided, including their names and dates when they went missing.
The CJP also wondered whether the chairman of the Commission of Inquiry had ever been changed after it was first formed. The counsel informed him the chairman had not been changed since 2011.

4,"TTP influx continues in merged districts, Senate told",Interior ministry says militants continuously trying to sabotage fence along Afghan border.,"• Interior ministry says militants continuously trying to sabotage fence along Afghan border
• Six barbers from Dera Ghazi Khan shot dead in Mir Ali
• Four militants killed in operation in Miramshah, says ISPR
ISLAMABAD / NORTH WAZIRISTAN: The continuous influx of TTP members in significant numbers, with recruitment, training and placing of suicide bombers, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s mer­ged districts is “a cause of concern”, the Ministry of Interior informed the upper house of parliament on Tuesday.
The ministry’s statement came as the Senate was briefed about the escalating influence and activities of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) following the withdrawal of US troops’ from Afghanistan and the inaction of the interim Afghan government against the banned group.
The interior ministry, in a written response during question hour, highlighted the TTP’s reorganisation and operational expansion during the peace talks in 2022, which has significantly increased its militant activities.
“It has given significant rise to its activities and is seeking the support of other militant groups to increase strength and capabilities. It is mostly concentrated in KP, especially merged districts, with footprints in Balochistan and trying to activate its network in the country,” it said.
 
 

“The arrival of tashkeels of TTP in significant numbers continue in merged districts along with recruitment, training and placing of suicide bombers is a cause of concern,” the ministry said.
The ministry said Daesh — an Arabic acronym for the self-proclaimed Islamic State militant group — was also trying to establish a foothold in Pakistan and resorted to terrorist activities against Shias and religious minority communities to ignite sectarian strife.
It said fencing along the western borders of Pakistan had largely been completed to further strengthen the state mechanism of curbing the illegal movement from across the border. However, it pointed out that the two organisations, particularly the TTP, continued to sabotage the fence.
Pakistan started fencing its porous border with Afghanis­tan in March 2017, after facing a spate of deadly attacks from Afghanistan-based militant groups in the previous year.
The barrier, being built on the 2,640km Durand Line, is near completion. It passes through rugged mountains, densely forested valleys and narrow rock passages.
Militants have ramped up their attacks since they revoked a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022.
In the deadliest attack on security forces in the outgoing year, at least 23 Pakistan Army soldiers were martyred and more than 30 troops wounded on Dec 12 after militants belonging to the Tehreek-i-Jihad Pakistan stormed a compound used by the military in Dera Ismail Khan’s Daraban area.
And just two days ago, on Sunday, three militants were gunned down when they tried to infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghan border in the Bajaur district.
Deportation to Afghanistan
The ministry said data of 1.45 million registered refugees was updated and expanded through the issuance of smart identity cards. “The cards contain basic information, including biometric data, and are compatible with the local systems,” it said.
 
 

It said the rationale for updating and documenting data was to strictly monitor individuals involved in criminal and terrorist activities.
About dismantling the communication networks to combat online extremism, it said the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) was actively monitoring cyberspace.
“A total number of 16,522 complaints were forwarded to social media platforms for blocking of radical/sectarian, anti-state and terrorist content during the year 2022,” it said.
The House was also informed that more than 500,000 illegal immigrants have been repatriated so far under the government’s deportation drive against illegal aliens.
“Around 1.7 million illegal aliens are unlawfully living in the country, the majority of whom are Afghans. They are living without any legal documentation necessary for staying in the country,” the ministry said.
It said 541,210 people had been sent back after the cabinet’s approval of the deportation plan for illegal residents.
Besides, close to 1.15m were still residing in the country, the ministry said, adding that efforts were underway to identify and deport the remaining people.
It said 271,985 people were repatriated via Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 159,161 through Balochistan.
Six barbers  shot dead
Meanwhile, unidentified assailants shot dead six barbers in the Mosaki village of Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan on Tuesday. The victims were residents of Punjab’s Dera Ghazi Khan district.
According to police, the bodies of the barbers, who had been running shops in Mir Ali bazaar for many years, were discovered in agricultural fields after being abducted and executed in the night by unknown assailants.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the killings.
Bodies of the victims were spotted by local people in the morning and they alerted the police about the incident.
The bodies were shifted to a hospital in Mir Ali for autopsy. Local police have launched an investigation into the incident.
Last month, some unknown armed men kidnapped eight non-local labourers from the Spinwam tehsil of the North Waziristan district.
Four militants killed
Meanwhile, four militants, including a suicide bomber, were killed in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Sheen Kot area of Miramshah tehsil of North Waziristan district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Tuesday.
The statement said the IBO was conducted on the reported presence of the militants in the area. It said that during the operation, an intense exchange of fire took place between militants and security forces in which four militants, including a suicide bomber, were killed.
“The killed terrorists remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and were planning to conduct a high-profile terrorist attack, which was averted due to proactive response by the security forces,” the ISPR said.
It said that arms, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the militants.
