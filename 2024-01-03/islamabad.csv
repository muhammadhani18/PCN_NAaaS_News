Ther thick fog disrupted many domestic and international flights and train services, and the motorway remained closed for normal traffic till the afternoon on Tuesday.
“The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Tuesday witnessed the dense fog,” said a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department. “The visibility remained 100 metres in twin cities at 1am and below 50 metres from 5am to 8am, while the sun overpowered the fog after 11am,” he said.
The minimum temperature was recorded at 2.8 degrees Celsius in Islamabad and 3 degrees Celsius in Rawalpindi.
“We forecast the same weather conditions for Wednesday as the fog started creeping in Rawalpindi near the Kashmir Expressway at 8pm on Tuesday, which is likely to grip the twin cities on Wednesday morning,” the official said.
Some journeys were rescheduled at Islamabad International Airport, Rawalpindi Railway Station, and on the roads in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The city traffic moved at a snail’s pace on G. T. Road, as the visibility had not improved until the afternoon. 
The office goers faced difficulties while going to their destinations. Most people arrived late to their offices.
“The flights from Islamabad to Karachi were rescheduled from 10am to 4pm. Flight from Islamabad to Gilgit departed at 3:05pm instead of scheduled time 10am. Other domestic and international flights were delayed,” said airport officials.
“The fog all around Punjab has badly affected trains. Trains to Lahore and Karachi have been late by four to five hours or more,” said a Pakistan Railways official at Rawalpindi Railway Station. The worst affected trains are the Awami Express, Quetta Express, Pakistan Express, Jaffar Express, Karachi Express, Taizgam, and night coaches.
The spokesman for the Motorway Police said that Motorways I, II, and III were opened for traffic in the afternoon. He said that the Motorway police deputed a special squad at some spots for the safety of commuters. He also said that the police were getting the cell phone numbers of the motorway users to provide them with the latest information on weather conditions during their journey on the motorway.

1,FDE recruitments on FIA’s radar,"Agency seeks record of candidates, selection board","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has started a probe into at least 525 appointments of non-teaching staff made by the Federal Directorate of Education a few months ago, allegedly in violation of the recruitment rules.
In a letter sent by a deputy director of the FIA anti-corruption wing, the agency sought the “record of recruitment of 525 non-teaching staff” as well as the information pertaining to the advertisement, selection board, litigation, selected candidates, and domiciles. The FIA also asked the FDE to share the merit list along with the approval of the noting portion.
The FIA sources said that the inquiry was launched following the complaints of the violation of merit and rules during the recruitment process. “During the inquiry, things will become clear,” said a source.
The FDE had advertised low-grade jobs, such as naib qasids, guards, lab attendants, library attendants, sanitation workers, and so on. In response, 47,000 applications were received, out of which 23,000 candidates were declared eligible for interviews during the scrutiny process. Subsequently, five interview panels were notified.

Agency seeks record of candidates, selection board

Then-FDE Director General Dr Ikram Ali Malik, who was removed from his position unceremoniously in July-August, had approved a list of final candidates after the interviews. But he was removed from the position three months before the completion of his tenure, ostensibly due to his opposition to the education ministry primarily on two issues: the abovementioned recruitment process and handing over a 21-kanal plot almost worth Rs20 billion to a private firm for the construction of a private school.
Sources close to Dr Malik said he was under pressure to “accommodate those candidates who had not even applied within the deadline and had no domicile of Islamabad”. Reportedly, he was sacked for resisting these moves. Similarly, the then-deputy director general was also removed from his post after he did not attend a ceremony in which the agreement to hand over the 21-kanal plot to the private firm was signed. The summary to remove DG, surprisingly, was also moved to the federal government on the same day.
A temporary DG was appointed after the removal of Dr Malik, who approved the recruitments after interviewing the candidates were held afresh. Sources stated that there were reports that many blue-eyed candidates were facilitated during the process.
“This is a very simple case; the FIA should check the domicile of all recruited employees. If Islamabad’s domiciles are made after the advertisement for the jobs then it will be easy for the investigation agency to dig out the truth,” said an employee of the FDE.
Rules say that only residents having the domiciles of the capital city are eligible to get low-grade jobs in Islamabad’s government departments.
Like the said recruitment process, the FDE also signed a controversial agreement with the above-mentioned private firm for the private school in F-11.
Subsequently, teachers and principal associations of FDE-run schools, through lawyer Kashif Ali Malik filed a case in the Islamabad High Court against the said agreement. Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, before granting a stay order, hinted at sending this case to the National Accountability Bureau.
The counsel of the petitioners had pleaded that under Article 25-A, the state through the FDE was supposed to provide free and compulsory education to all children. But, in this case, the FDE violated Article 25-A through its decision to give away the plot to a private firm. The stay granted by IHC is still intact.
On the other hand, the education ministry and the FDE had always defended all three issues: removal of DG, recruitment process, and signing agreement for setting up a private school on a government plot.
An officer of the ministry, on several occasions, said that the DG was removed because of his “poor performance” and his sacking had nothing to do with anything else.
He had also stated that the recruitment process was purely made on merit following rules and regulations. Whereas, he had stated that signing the school plot agreement was also legal as it was done after completing all legal formalities. He had said the private school would offer free education to at least 20pc students and after 23 years, the building would be handed back to the FDE.

2,"Federal Ombudsman summons NIH, Drap chiefs over shortage of anti-rabies vaccines",ISLAMABAD: Federal Ombudsman Ejaz Ahmed Qureshi has summoned top health officials for explanation over ...,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Ombudsman Ejaz Ahmed Qureshi has summoned top health officials for explanation over unavailability of anti-rabies vaccines in government hospitals of Islamabad.
According to an official announcement on Tuesday, the ombudsman has issued summons to the heads of National Institute of Health (NIH) and Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) to appear before him on January 9.
The ombudsman has taken the action in response to a complaint from a resident of Islamabad, Nazim Hussain.
In his complaint, Mr Hussain had stated that his son was bitten by a rabid dog and when he approached various hospitals in Islamabad to get his son vaccinated, there was no vaccine available. Responding to the complaint, the federal ombudsman noted that unavailability of such essential vaccines for human life in major hospitals of Islamabad was a matter of deep concern. 
The ombudsman had directed Registrar Mohammad Saqib Khan to conduct an inquiry. The registrar contacted the heads of both these organisations and it was confirmed that the essential vaccine was not available. On this, the ombudsman summoned the heads of both the institutions.
In January 2020, the NIH had announced establishment of an antisera production plant, claiming that it would make the country self-sufficient in producing snake anti-venom and anti-rabies serum. The plant was established at a cost of Rs751 million and it was announced that after start of the production from the plant, Pakistan will not have to import anti-venom, the rabies serum, tetanus toxoid or the diphtheria antitoxin.
The then executive director of NIH, Dr Aamer Ikram, had stated that the country’s annual demand for anti-venom was about 80,000 to 90,000 vials, including 50,000 vials of the anti-rabies serum and claimed that the NIH produced almost a third of the required serums and the rest was imported.
Rabies is a virus which is transmitted to humans through a bite or scratch of an infected animal and invariably becomes fatal once symptoms are developed. However, the death can be prevented if for example a dog-bite victim is provided with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) timely and effectively, as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

4,Baloch protesters give call for countrywide shutterdown today,"ISLAMABAD: The Baloch protesters have called for a shutterdown strike across the country today (Wednesday), saying...","ISLAMABAD: The Baloch protesters have called for a shutterdown strike across the country today (Wednesday), saying that state officials were trying to label the Baloch long march and sit-in in Islamabad as “propaganda”, Dawn.Com reported.
“The state has consistently shown a half-hearted and uncommitted concern regarding our demands from the beginning,” the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), organiser of the protest demanding an end to enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings in Balochistan, said in a social media post.
“Hence, on Jan 3, we are calling for a shutterdown demonstration across Pakistan. We urge people from all walks of life to advocate and respect our call for the shutterdown strike in the name of humanity and the Baloch nation, aiming to preserve our identity,” it added.
Baloch protesters, who have been camping outside the National Press Club for over a week now, had on December 28 given the government a seven-day deadline to fulfil their demands which included the release of all protesters detained during police action, detailed investigation into rights violations in Balochistan, elimination of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, release of all victims of enforced disappearances, restrictions on the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and elimination of “state-sponsored death squads”.
In a video message shared on social media on Tuesday, Dr Mahrang Baloch, one of the protest organisers, said the protest march had begun after a Baloch youth was allegedly killed in custody by the CTD.
“Our movement is against the decade-long enforced disappearances and murders of innocent citizens in Balochistan,” she said, adding that all the residents of the province supported the protest.
Dr Mahrang alleged that the Islamabad police had used force to “sabotage” the long march and numerous “fake” first information reports (FIRs) had been registered against protesters across the country.
“We have been repeatedly told by the administration they are not ready to work on their policy of Baloch genocide,” she claimed.
She further alleged that over 20 Baloch youths had been forcibly disappeared “once again”.
Dr Mahrang demanded that all the Baloch people languishing in “illegal custody” should be presented before courts and given a right to a fair trial.
Further, she urged the nation to support the Baloch people and their call for the shutterdown strike.
The development came after caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar took exception to the support lent to protesters and said those supporting the demonstration could go join the Baloch militants. Mr Kakar had also insisted that those protesting in Islamabad were the “relatives of those fighting against the state” in Balochistan.
“From the inception of our movement, our demands have been clear: an end to all forms of human rights violations in Balochistan and the cessation of the Baloch genocide. We’ve presented these demands to the state through the media,” said Dr Mahrang.
She noted that the protesters sought to seek negotiations with the state regarding these demands.
“Sadly, the world witnesses the continuous irresponsibility and stubbornness of the state, where peaceful protesters endure torture and arrests, and media trials are being conducted against this peaceful movement,” she stated.

The protesters announced to continue their sit-ins daily in all districts till acceptance of their demands. The call for protests has been given by Awami Action Committee (ACC).
The GB government recently increased the subsidised wheat price from Rs20 kg to Rs36 per kg. In June last year, the government led by then chief minister Khalid Khurshid Khan had increased the price from Rs12 per kg to Rs20 per kg.
The protest demonstrations were held on Tuesday at Yadgar-i-Shuhada Skardu, Siddiq-i-Akbar Chowk Chillas, Etehad Chowk Gilgit and various areas of Diamer, Nagar, Hunza, Astore, Ghanche, Ghizer, Shigar and Kharmang.
Large numbers of people from various political groups, civil society organisations, trade unions and transport and tourism sectors participated in the demonstrations, chanting slogans against both the GB and federal governments for increasing the price of the subsidised wheat. They vowed to continue their protest till withdrawal of the decision and acceptance off their demands.
Meanwhile,speaking to the protesters at Etehad Chowk in Gilgit, AAC chief coordinator Ehsan Ali Advocate said the movement had been launched for the rights of the masses.
He said it had been decided that protest sit-ins will be held in all districts for two hours daily till acceptance of their demands. He said the GB government had not consulted the local people before increasing the prices. 
The committee also issued a charter of demands which said the price of the subsidised wheat should be restored to the 2022 level. It also demanded that the Finance Act 2023 should be suspended and all taxes imposed on GB people abolished.
Moreover, it also called for an end to the prolonged electricity crisis. It said GB should be given its share in the NFC award like other provinces of the country. The charter of demand included a demand for 80 per cent royalty of Diamer-Basha Dam net hydel profit and water usage right.
“People related to hotel, transportation and tourism sectors should be given the status of industry. Medical, engineering colleges and a women’s university should be established in GB, and all traditional routes of GB should be restored.” 
Opposition leader in the GB assembly Kazim Mesum and members from opposition benches have already supported the protest against the hike in the wheat price.

Federal Ombudsperson for FOSPAH Ms Fauzia Viqar said that during a briefing given to President Dr Arif Alvi who chaired a meeting during his visit to the FOSPAH Head Office on Tuesday.
Ms Viqar gave a detailed presentation about the role and achievements of FOSPAH in protecting women’s rights. She informed that FOSPAH was providing speedy justice in harassment at the workplace and property cases of women who had been deprived of their ownership rights.
She informed the president that out of 725 harassment cases, registered last year, 517 cases had been decided. She said that an upsurge had been witnessed in the registration of harassment and women’s property cases with FOSPAH due to the awareness campaign about its role and functions. She apprised the meeting that harassment of women and denial of property rights to women were pervasive issues in Pakistan.
According to a statement, appreciating the continued support of the President Dr Arif Alvi, she told the meeting that so far 208 representations against the decisions of FOSPAH had been filed with the President, out of which only 10 were under process with the office of the President while the rest had been decided.
President Alvi underscored the need for taking measures to improve the status of women, provide them employment opportunities and enabling working environment to increase their economic participation.
He said Islam granted property rights to women and it was collective responsibility to give them their due share and create a safer society for them.
The president called for taking appropriate legislative measures at the federal and provincial levels to ensure the protection of women’s property rights, besides discouraging the transfer of property by women to their family members due to pressures.
He said that he was conducting personal hearings of the Ombudspersons’ cases to expedite the process of justice. He stated that highlighting important decisions of FOSPAH in harassment and women’s property cases through media would help increase awareness about the role of the Ombudsman. He said that police at the local level needed to improve their response to women’s complaints in property cases, adding that police officials should be educated about the provisions of the Enforcement of Women’s Property Rights Act, 2020.
The President urged FOSPAH to further increase its outreach and efficiency to provide speedy justice to women in harassment and property cases at their doorsteps. He also advised FOSPAH to enhance its linkages with NGOs and women’s rights organisations in Pakistan to seek suggestions for improving women’s status.
The President said that providing a harassment-free and enabling environment to women in both the public and private sectors was essential for their economic and social empowerment.
He underlined the need for increased engagements with the business community, particularly the chambers of commerce and industries, to provide employment to women as well as sensitise them about the importance and provisions of the Protection against Harassment at Workplace Act, 2010.
Secretary FOSPAH Arif Karim, advisors and officials of FOSPAH attended the meeting. Ends-

10,No political gathering to be allowed in Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh,"Official says decision taken to avoid traffic blockades in Rawalpindi city, especially on Murree Road.","RAWALPINDI: The district administration has decided not to give permission for holding public meetings in Liaquat Bagh and other parks by political parties for their election campaigns to avoid traffic blockades within the city limits, especially on Murree Road.
A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that assistant commissioners had been asked to identify alternative sites for public meetings and submit recommendations within a day or two.
He said the deputy commissioner had asked the administration officials and police to prepare
a plan for public meetings and security arrangements for leaders of main political parties who will come to the city for public meetings till February 6 which is scheduled to be the last day for electioneering.

Official says decision taken to avoid traffic blockades in Rawalpindi city, especially on Murree Road

When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that by January 13 public meetings will formally start after the final list of candidates is scheduled to be published. He said that arrangements had to be made in this regard.
“If candidates and political parties plan their public meetings on Murree Road, Liaquat Bagh and Fawara Chowk, mean roads on Murree Road and Raja Bazaar will have to be closed and it will create hardship for commuters between Rawalpindi and Islamabad and in and around Raja Bazaar.
He said that there was a dire need to adopt measures to secure thickly-populated areas from traffic congestions.
“In federal capital, the Capital Development Authority has allocated Parade Ground for public meetings and we want to allocate spacious places for public gatherings with sufficient space for parking, security and other requirements,” he said.
He said the administration was aware that Liaquat Bagh was important for public meetings during electioneering but there was a dire need to avoid it for convenience of the local residents.
LiaquatBaghhas too much importance in the political history of the country as two former prime ministers were killed there during public
meetings. Pakistan’s first Prime MinisterLiaquatAli Khan was assassinated at Liaquat Bagh on October 17, 1951.
After the assassination, LiaquatMemorial Hall was constructed in the park and it was managed by Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) till 2006.
In 2006, National College of Arts (NCA) Rawalpindi was established and the control of the memorial hall was given to it while the park was given under the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA).
On December 27, 2007, former prime minister and PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in a gun-bomb attack when she was leaving Liaquat Bagh after addressinga publicmeeting.
During the British rule, the garden was known as CompanyBagh,spreading over 30 acres. Due to encroachments, the size of Liaquat Bagh has shrunk to 52 kanals and still its land is being encroached upon by the government in the name of development.

It asked the officials to share these plans with the provincial election commissioners who will forward them to the ECP central control room established at the Secretariat.
The guidelines said strict disciplinary action would be initiated under Section 55 of the Elections Act, 2017 against staff found absent or negligent on security duty.
A letter containing guidelines was sent to the district returning officers and returning officers as well as the Punjab chief secretary and the police chiefs.

Transportation, communication plans to be finalised five days before polling

Under the guidelines, a committee headed by a relevant DRO and comprising the district election commissioner, deputy commissioner or a nominated officer of the deputy commissioner and the returning officer concerned had “been tasked to take assessment of movement plan and requirement of vehicles for transportation of polling staff and election material before poll day and after completion of polling”.
According to the guideline, preferably one vehicle for one location (a polling station) may be hired keeping in view the convenience of polling staff, prompt dispatch of results, and proper security of staff and polling bags.
In case, more than one polling stations are established in one building then the presiding officers and senior assistant presiding officers of such polling stations may be adjusted in one vehicle subject to its capacity.
Similarly, if there is a deficiency of vehicles in the area then more than one polling station can be clubbed for transportation of polling staff/election material by taking into account their vicinity with each other.
Under the guideline, during the delivery of election material from RO’s office and retrieval of election material, the presiding officer along with the senior assistant presiding officer shall be accompanied by a sufficient number of security personnel for each polling station.
In case of the absence of deputed security personnel, the matter shall be immediately reported to the RO. In case of failure to do so, strict disciplinary action will be imposed under section 55 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Similarly, the other security staff to be engaged for manning polling stations are required to move separately as per their separate transportation arrangements for deployment on duty.
The RO concerned is advised to keep complete details: vehicles with registration numbers, drivers with their contact numbers and security staff accompanying the presiding officer.
While hiring a vehicle for the transportation of staff and election material, the guidelines asked to ensure that the capacity and condition of the vehicle were as per the requirement of that particular area.
A senior official claimed that they have completed 90 per cent of the guidelines given by the ECP chief regarding the transportation plan for the smooth conduct of 2024 polls and the rest will be completed within a couple of days.
In light of these instructions, the Punjab IG gave orders to the police, divisional and district administration and regional transport authorities to complete all matters related to the election duty.

This panel discussion titled “Socially and Environmentally Compliant Construction Industry in Pakistan” was held at SDPI where Geir Thomas Tonstol, the Country Director of the International Labour Organisation, Pakistan, said that the construction sector transforms source materials into capital assets, contributing significantly to economic activity thus holding immense potential for poverty reduction and income generation. However, he said, the lack of specialised skills and high risks of occupational hazards have made it one of the riskiest sectors globally.
He also said that the high prevalence of informal employment further weakens social security and workers’ rights and that coordinated efforts are required by the government, employers, and workers with initiatives focusing on promoting greater compliance and fostering decent working conditions in the construction industry in Pakistan.
According to a statement, Dr Saifullah from Development Impact Solutions, highlighting the hazardous working conditions in the brick kiln industry, said that out of 4.4-5.2 million brick kiln workers, 68pc were doing bonded or forced labour, with19pc being under 18 years of age. 
The industry employs an estimated 1.3 million workers, including 23pc women, with 69pc dedicated to molding. He called for enhancing productivity by introducing new technologies to reduce occupational and environmental hazards.
Mr Khalid Mahmood, director Labour Education Foundation, stressed the need to protect workers’ rights for a truly just transition.
Malik Najaf Khan from Sindh People’s Housing for Flood Affectees remarked that land rights were at the heart of the reconstruction efforts and called for empowering affected people through ownership, particularly for women and vulnerable households.
Mr Mehar Abdul Haq, Brick Kilns Owners’ Association Pakistan, called for eco-friendly technologies in kilns, such as Zig Zag, for emissions reduction, energy conservation, and enhanced environmental sustainability. He also called for enhancing registration of kiln workers with the government institutions concerned particularly social protection institutions and strict enforcement and compliance of labour laws, safety standards, and environmental regulations within the brick kiln industry.
He suggested providing capacity-building training for brick kiln workers, regarding environment-friendly and safer brick-making techniques, health safety, and labour rights and incentivising the adoption of eco-friendly technologies. He emphasised ensuring strict adherence to labour laws and the protection of workers’ rights within the brick kiln industry and fostering collaborative partnerships between government agencies, non-governmental organisations, industry associations, and international bodies to develop and implement policies that support environmentally compliant brick kilns.
