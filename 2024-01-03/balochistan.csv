3,SHC orders police to go by law while taking action,Asks police chief to ensure proper enforcement of law to rebuild public trust,"The Sindh High Court (SHC), while ruling on a plea seeking disclosure of lawsuits filed against PTI leader Haleem Adil Sheikh, ordered the provincial police chief on Tuesday to ensure the law enforcers operate in accordance with the law.
The court stated in its ruling that Sheikh, as a Pakistani national, is entitled to fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution. The court expressed concern over the inadequate application of law by the Sindh police. 
It is perplexing that Sheikh was re-arrested in a manner similar to previous ones, indicating that the police intended to keep him detained, the court stated. Despite being granted bail, Sheikh faced re-arrest by police, raising questions about the motives behind these actions. 
It appears that the police are determined to keep Sheikh incarcerated for an extended period, the court stated and reminded the police that public trust in the criminal justice system is built on fair and just actions. The repeated arrests and actions by the Sindh police are eroding this trust.

The IG Sindh is urged to ensure that law enforcement agencies operate in accordance with the law. The need for an independent police force is crucial to rebuild public trust. The Sindh police must be transparent and accountable in their actions to restore confidence in the criminal justice system.
Meanwhile, the judicial magistrate for District South formally charged Ali Zaidi, a leader of Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party, and Haleem Adil Sheikh in a case involving Hassaan Niazi's escape from the City Court.
Both Zaidi and Sheikh were present in the court when it issued charges against them. However, both pleaded not guilty to the charges. Subsequently, the court scheduled the next hearing for January 6 and summoned witnesses. The incident, involving Hassaan Niazi's escape from the City Court, led to the registration of a case against the accused at the City Court police station.
Separately, a district court remanded two suspects in police custody and sent seven others to jail on judicial remand in connection with cases related to aerial firing on New Year's eve. Police presented the suspects before different districts and sessions judges at the Karachi City Court.

According to him, the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) and its private contractor Pak Altas being responsible for the solid waste disposal are efficiently fulfilling their task.

9,Road network awaits reconstruction,KMC’s inefficiency in completing repair work has left major avenues across the city in a rugged state,"Although the purpose of connective infrastructure is to provide a smooth surface for cars to travel seamlessly, outright negligence on part of the development authorities in their reconstruction of the road network in Karachi, has ironically turned commuters’ urban journeys into an endlessly bumpy ride.
Despite the Sindh government allocating a billion rupee budget for development endeavours in the port city, the concerned local bodies have failed to complete their road reconstruction work in time, leaving countless major roads in a dilapidated state for months and years, thereby flustering the commuters who have to endure regular gridlocks and simultaneously bear damage to their vehicles.
“Due to the bumpy roads in Karachi, my motorcycle keeps breaking down every now and then, costing me at least Rs3000 to Rs4000 for its repair. The state of roads has exacerbated my anger issues,” complained Muhammad Amir, a resident of the Federal C area, who further revealed that the local bodies had demolished the old road network six months ago for patchwork at different places but apparently forgot to carpet it back.
Saeed Mughal, a spokesperson for the Karachi Contractor Association seconded Amir’s statement, when he confirmed that poor planning and lack of transparency in awarding construction tenders to the contractors had left almost all roads across the city in shambles.
Read KMC may collect tax via power bills
According to an assessment carried out by the Express Tribune, multiple roads across the city including MA Jinnah Road, New MA Jinnah Road, SM Taufiq Road, Shahra Pakistan, Rashid Minhas Road, University Road, Altaf Barelvi Road, Nishtar Road, Jail Road, Jamshed Road, Hakeem Ibne Sina Road, Sher Shah Suri Road, Garden Road, MT Khan Road, Hub River Road, Korangi Industrial Area Road, Karsaz Road, and Pir Sibghatullah Shah Rashidi Road were in total disrepair, with some having no carpeting and others having huge sinkholes.
“Tenders are assigned to contractors based on favouritism due to which quality roads are not being constructed,” disclosed an official from the KMC on the condition of anonymity, who also divulged that Rs5 billion had been allocated for development in the city but even after six months, the Sindh government had not paid a single penny, due to which all the development activities had come to a standstill.
Dr Nauman Ahmed, a professor at the NED University of Engineering and Technology was of the opinion that in principle the repair work of major roads in the city should have been centralized by the authorities so that those who have land management should be entrusted with these duties. “The Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) should get the repair work of roads done by its engineering department instead of pursuing contractors, which will not only save money but will also speed up the work,” opined Dr Ahmed.
A spokesperson of the KMC while speaking to the Express Tribune on the matter said, “No payment has been issued by the Sindh government for the District Annual Development Program, due to which the development works are delayed. However, some roads are being reconstructed.”
