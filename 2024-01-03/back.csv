0,CJP Isa pushes PTI on back foot,Top judge questions lack of proof to justify ‘enforced disappearances’ of party leaders,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa has pushed the PTI on the back foot by raising questions about the lack of material to justify senior politician and lawyer Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan’s petition on the “enforced disappearances” of party leaders.
There is a chance that Ahsan may himself appear before a three-judge Supreme Court bench led by the CJP on Wednesday (today) to justify his plea.
So far, CJP Isa is not satisfied with Ahsan’s locus standi to approach the SC against the alleged enforced disappearances of PTI leaders.
He observed that apparently the petition was filed for the “benefit” of a political party. The CJP noted that those mentioned in the petition were missing in 2023, but now they had returned and left the PTI.
These individuals did not give any statement about their “enforced disappearances”. It is clear that there is a severe clash between the ‘powerful circles' and the PTI since the change of regime through a no-confidence resolution against former premier Imran Khan.

Their clash further intensified after last year’s riots on May 9. Former CJP Umar Ata Bandial tried hard to give relief to the PTI in difficult times, but he could not succeed. PTI supporters have targeting Justice Isa on social media platforms ever since he took over as the CJP in September last year.
The PTI wants judicial intervention in every important matter but at the same time, a campaign is under way against CJP Isa on social media outlets. However, this strategy has not worked yet.
It is fact that there is charged environment wherein both sides – the PTI and its opponents -- are pressuring the superior judiciary. The PTI seeks the courts’ intervention to provide it with a level playing field in the run up to the next general elections. However, the other sides are opposing the interference of the courts in matters related to the general polls.
A three-judge bench led by acting CJP Sardar Tariq Masood took up the PTI petition for providing the party with a level playing field in the run up to the upcoming general polls. The bench grilled the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not resolving the grievances of the PTI candidates.

Subsequently, the high courts also started giving relief to the PTI. Since the SC's intervention, some judges are facing criticism on social media platforms for their remarks in favour of the PTI leaders.
Now the main question being discussed is whether or not the superior judiciary will compel the ECP to allot the electoral symbol of the ‘cricket bat’ to the PTI. A three-judge bench led by CJP Isa will take up the PTI's contempt petition on Wednesday (today) against the ECP for not implementing the SC's order to resolve the grievances of the party leaders that they have not been provided with a level playing field.
A senior politician says that there is a consensus that if the PTI receives its popular electoral symbol, it will become the biggest party in the upcoming general polls. He believes that the elections will be delayed if the PTI receives its electoral symbol through the superior judiciary.

1,SC wants missing persons’ report,Wonders how commission issues production orders without knowing detention details,"The Supreme Court has directed the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances to submit, within ten days, a comprehensive report detailing all orders issued to law enforcement agencies (LEAs) for the production of missing persons.
Additionally, the court has appointed renowned lawyer Faisal Siddiqi to assist in this matter.
A three-member SC bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa, resumed hearings on Wednesday concerning petitions regarding enforced disappearances, including the alleged abduction of various PTI leaders following the May 9 incidents.
During proceedings, the CJ inquired if the petitioners were content with the performance of the missing persons’ commission. In response, the petitioners and their legal representatives expressed dissatisfaction.
Chief Justice Isa queried the commission’s registrar, Khalid Naseem, present in court, about the commission's leadership and its head’s age. The registrar informed the court that former SC judge Javed Iqbal, 77, has led the commission since its inception in 2011.
Justice Isa also questioned if commission members were receiving salaries without actively engaging in work. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, another bench member, further asked about the frequency of the commission's sessions and the number of recovered missing persons.
The registrar indicated that the commission retrieved 46 individuals in December 2023 and clarified that joint investigation teams (JITs) formed by the commission involve officials from covert agencies.
He also noted that retired SC and high court judges serving in the commission receive salaries equivalent to those of their active counterparts.
CJ Isa raised concerns about the commission members receiving salaries despite already receiving pensions. He pointed out that a retired judge engaged by the government does not receive payment, and there is no mention of remuneration in the commission's SRO—Statutory Regulatory Order.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar highlighted that while the commission was initially established for six months, its term was extended, allowing its continued operation.
The bench questioned how the commission could issue production orders for missing persons without knowledge of their whereabouts. Justice Mazhar emphasized that knowing the detaining agency is crucial for issuing such orders.
""Despite this, the commission has resolved ten thousand cases,"" he added.
CJ Isa stressed the need for a permanent solution and ordered relevant authorities to present a comprehensive report on production orders issued since the commission's inception.
When Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan suggested a new, high-powered commission, CJ Isa acknowledged the existing commission's work.
""We currently seek complete details of missing persons and their families who approached the commission, including their names and addresses. Based on this information, we may consider urging the government to establish a new commission,"" he stated.
The bench disagreed with the proposal of including serving judges in the commission, citing their existing caseload and the commission's full-time commitment. The court adjourned for two weeks.""
