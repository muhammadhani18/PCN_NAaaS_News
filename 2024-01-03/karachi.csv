0,Sindh govt introduces ‘first in country’ teaching licence test,"Creates around 400 grade-16 vacancies of ""elementary teacher"" for BEd graduates.","KARACHI: The Caretaker Sindh Government introduced Pakistan’s first teaching licence test on Tuesday. 
It has created grade-16 posts of elementary teacher for BEd (2.5/4 years) graduates. 
Subject to the provincial government’s recruitment rules, the candidates passing the licence test will be eligible for the posts. 
This step will ensure a higher calibre of educators in public schools and will lead to a culture of teaching excellence in Sindh, according to officials. 
Sukkur Institute of Business Administration’s Testing Services is accepting online applications for the test at https://apply.sts.net.pk until January 11, 2024. 

Creates around 400 grade-16 vacancies of ‘elementary teacher’ for BEd graduates

BEd secondary (1.5 years) graduates will be eligible to apply for the Teaching Licence (Secondary) in subsequent testing cycles.
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Caretaker Sindh Minister for Education Rana Hussain said that this step was only for helping teachers and facilitating their promotion. “If you have done your B.Ed from whichever of the two semesters, you are ready and eligible to sit for the licensing test,” she said. 
She said that it is a proud moment for the Government of Sindh to be the first in the country and the province to come out with teaching licence. “You should use it to your advantage,” she said, adding that the test can be taken at any of three test centres -- Karachi, Hyderabad or Sukkur. 
“We have also taken care to keep the tests on weekends so that your normal teaching schedules don’t get disturbed. So do avail this opportunity to become a professional teacher, she added. 
“So raise your status and be known as a professional licensed teacher,” she concluded.  
It was last year, on May 25, that for the first time in Pakistan, the Sindh Teaching Licence Policy was approved (by the provincial cabinet) with the aim of attracting talented youth to the teaching profession and raising the status of the profession.
The landmark reform are aimed at bringing the same rigour and respect to the teaching profession as enjoyed by other skill-based professions, including medicine, accounting, law and engineering. New entrants to the field of teaching will be both required and incentivised to get professional training before seeking jobs.
New vacancies
Some 400 new vacancies were created for Elementary School Teachers (eligible to teach grades 1-8) across Sindh at BPS-16. 
Previously, Junior Elementary School Teachers (JESTs) were being inducted in BPS-14 and were required to have completed graduation in any field. These new vacancies are only for graduates of the BEd degree programme, who have also cleared the licensing exam.
A growing body of research clearly establishes the value of effective teachers. Econometric research from the past decade shows that effective teachers can deliver three times the learning in a single academic year than ineffective teachers can.
As is well-known, a good teacher can transform a mediocre curriculum into a very rich learning experience. This makes a strong case for education reform to focus on raising teacher quality and support. Teacher licensing is one of the ways to do so.
Teaching licence sets a minimum standard for new entrants, which will raise the status of the teaching profession in public perception. This has been seen in several other professions, both in Pakistan and globally. In the short term, improved public perception provides the justification for raising teachers’ salaries. In long term, it helps attract talented youth to the profession. 
Preparation of policy 
The policy preparation was preceded by a year-long research and consultation led by the Aga Khan University’s Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED), which culminated in a ‘White Paper’ which was jointly launched by AKU-IED, Sindh Teachers Education Development Authority (STEDA) and Durbeen in June of 2022. Consultations were held among a wide range of stakeholders – Pakistani universities, school managements, teachers, teachers’ unions, students and their parents. Scholars from several other institutions, including Ziauddin University, contributed to the policy writing efforts. 
Existing full-time government school teachers can choose to continue employment as per the status quo, or if they meet the requirements under the policy, they may opt for the licensing exam and expedite their promotions. Contractual teachers in government schools, who meet the requirements, can expedite regularisation through the licensing process.
In subsequent licence testing cycles, the government will introduce the Teaching Licence Secondary (grades 6-12) and the Teaching Licence Primary (grades 1-5).

1,Number of appeals against rejection of nomination papers in Sindh tops 90,"Awab Alvi, PTI's former MNAs Alamgir and Aftab Jahangir are among appellants who filed appeals against RO's orders.","KARACHI: Around 70 more appellants on Tuesday approached the elections tribunals against the decisions of returning officers about rejection and acceptance of nomination papers.
Awab Alvi, a son of President Arif Alvi, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s former MNAs Alamgir and Aftab Jahangir and Aurangzeb Farooqui of Pakistan Rah-i-Haq Party were among the appellants who filed their appeals against ROs’ orders on the second day of the process.
Officials at the Sindh High Court said that they have so far received over 90 such appeals during the last two days and over 70 on Tuesday alone. 
Around 20 appeals were submitted on Monday. Wednesday (today) is the last day to file such appeals. Six election appellate tribunals, established across the province, will decide such appeals by Jan 10.
The nomination papers of Awab Alvi were rejected from NA-241(Karachi South-III) and the candidatures of former lawmakers Alamgir and Aftab Jahangir were declined from NA-236 (Karachi East-II) and NA-244 (Karachi West-I), respectively.
The leader of Pakistan Rah-i-Haq Party through his lawyer also filed election petition as his nomination papers for PS-88 (Malir-V) were rejected by the RO concerned.
PTI’s candidates Amjad Iqbal Afridi, who filed his papers for NA-242 and NA- 243(Karachi Keamari I & II), Aslam Khalid for NA-248 (Karachi Central-II), Subhan Ali Sahil (NA-243) and Muzammil Aslam for NA-241 (Karcahi South-III) also approached the election tribunals after their nomination papers were rejected.
Besides, some candidates of Pakistan Peoples Party and Awami National Party and a large number of independent aspirants also challenged the decisions of ROs.
The candidatures of Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) leaders Dr Fehmida Mirza, her spouse Dr Zulfiqar Mirza and their sons were rejected from two NA and three provincial assembly seats from Badin.
While talking to media on the premises of SHC, Barrister Hasnain Mirza was of the view that identical objections were raised against the candidature of his parents in the past and the SHC had dismissed the same.
He further said that his candidature was rejected for NA-222 (Badin-I) and PS-70 while the nomination papers for PS-71 were accepted.
The RO of NA-223 (Badin-II) had turned down the candidatures of Dr Fehmida and Dr Mirza as well as their son Hassam Mirza on similar grounds and the RO’s orders said that the lawyers of two banks and contesting candidates had filed objections against the couple while Election Commission of Pakistan in its report also said that the names of both candidates fell in the default list received from the State Bank of Pakistan.
They are likely to approach the election tribunals on Wednesday.

2,"PPP accuses PML-N, JUI-F of ‘conspiring together’ to run away from elections",Nisar Khuhro claims fear of defeat behind Fazl’s suggestion to delay polls; says putting off Feb 8 election will be contempt of SC.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Tuesday accused its former allies, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), of ‘conspiring together’ to get the Feb 8 general elections delayed after sensing their defeat. They were also seeking ‘guarantees’ before the day of polling, it noted. 
PPP Sindh president Senator Nisar Khuhro at a news conference in Bilawal House asserted that elections must be held on February 8 “come what may”, cautioning that any move to cause delay in the elections would be taken as a contempt of Supreme Court, which had intervened to ensure the date of polling after much uncertainty. 
The PPP leader also warned that a delay in the elections would not only weaken democracy in the country, but would also provide terrorist groups a space due to absence of strong administration and elected representatives in the country. 
“It [suggestion to delay polls] has all been started by Maulana Sahib [JUI-F chief Fazlur Rehman]. He is referring to deteriorating law and order as an excuse to delay the polls. We ask Maulana Sahib what guarantees he’s seeking under the garb of this excuse? Let it be very clear to everyone that it’s not the timely polls, but delay in the polls that would deepen the fear of terrorism in the country.”

Khuhro claims fear of defeat behind Fazl’s suggestion to delay polls; says putting off Feb 8 election will be contempt of SC

He also accused PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif of remaining silent on the suggestion of delaying the elections by maintaining that he himself didn’t want polls to be held on February 8. 
Khuhro claimed that the former prime minister [Nawaz Sharif] was looking for an escape from the elections in fear of defeat even in his stronghold, Punjab. “And the proof is that he has not yet launched his party’s election campaign in Punjab,” said the Senator. 
“They both want to run away from the polls. So one ally is suggesting a delay and the other is staying silent on such an anti-democracy proposal. They are well-aware that they are no more popular. The people will reject them. So the escape is the best possible solution they have found out.”
Senator Waqar Mehdi, PPP Sindh general secretary, seconding Senator Khuhro’s stance, questioned the emerging electoral alliance in Sindh where the PML-N was aligning with the JUI-F and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) against PPP only “to attack the Constitution”. 
The alliance in elections against the PPP wasn’t a new phenomenon, he said. 
“But this time [for Feb 8 polls] they [PML-N, MQM-P and JUI-F] are not joining hands against the PPP. They are uniting to attack the 18th Constitutional Amendment showing their real anti-democracy face. But these parties have already lost credibility by changing sides as they all are signatories of the same amendment made more than a decade ago and have now turned against it only for vested political interests.” 
Responding to a question, Senator Khuhro said his party had not yet decided the names of candidates for the Feb 8 elections and it would take another few days to issue the final list.

The city’s municipal commissioner, on the directives of Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, has urged the Karachi commissioner to help make the ban effective and regarded by all political parties.
“It has been observed that various political parties are using municipal infrastructure for political purposes by installing party flags and banners,” the municipal commissioner’s letter said.
“Also, as the general elections are scheduled to be held in the near future, there has been an increase in political wall chalking. It may kindly be noted that such use of municipal infrastructure not only gives an untidy look to the city, but also adds to operational expenses of the [city] council. Therefore, it is requested that all political parties may be instructed not to use municipal infrastructure for political purposes and refrain from hoisting flags and banners on street light poles, pedestrian bridges, bridges & underpasses, gantries and other infrastructure.”

5,Most commercial buildings in city have  no fire safety system: report,Poor quality electrical wiring blamed for most incidents of fire,"KARACHI: Exposing severe emergency management flaws in the metropolis, an audit survey reveals that some 260 out of 266 commercial buildings having offices and workplaces on three main thoroughfares — Sharea Faisal, I.I. Chundrigar Road and Shahrah-i-Quaideen — do not have any fire safety system and 60 per cent of these multi-storey structures don’t even have an emergency exit for quick evacuation.  
The initial report of fire security audit of buildings along three major roads, prepared by the fire department, came to surface on Tuesday when city mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab Siddiqi shared its key findings, calling the situation ‘very critical’.  
The mayor asked the authorities concerned, including Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and respective district administrations, to take immediate steps to address the challenge and avoid any major incident.  
“We had decided to carry out fire security audits in multi-storey buildings of Karachi,” he said in a statement.

Poor quality electrical wiring blamed for most incidents of fire

“The fire department has completed the audit survey of 266 buildings situated along the key roads, Sharea Faisal, I.I. Chundrigar Road and Shahrah-i-Quaideen. We found that only six buildings have a fire safety system in place. The 60 per cent of these buildings don’t even have a fire exit.” 
In November last year, the Karachi mayor ordered a ‘fire security audit’ of all high-rises located along three major arteries following a fire in a high-rise on Rashid Minhas Road which claimed 11 lives. All the victims were suffocated to death due to lack of ventilation and emergency exit in the multi-storey building.  
The terms of reference of the audit says: To assess fire safety measures including escape routes and emergency exits, basic fire safety equipment, including smoke detectors, fire watch guards, fire extinguishers, fire hose, etc, electric wiring and general condition of electrical equipment, electric meters, including switches, plugs, etc; and to make recommendations to the building managements.  
Barrister Wahab had assigned Chief Fire Officer of the fire department Ishtiaq Ahmed to lead the safety audit.  
The mayor said action would be taken against those buildings which were found without any fire exit.  
Sharing details of the audit report, he said the team of experts also found poor quality electrical wiring in 70 per cent of the 266 buildings, which is one of the major reasons for fires.  
“Similarly, there were only 90 buildings which have smoke detectors and fire alarms,” said Mayor Wahab.  
“The report also recommends the deputy commissioners to cooperate with the fire department and provide all required assistance in case of any fire incident in their areas. We have also asked the SBCA and formally sent the recommendations. The authority has been asked to do its job to ensure fire safety in these buildings.”

7,SHC describes police conduct as unprofessional,Disposes of petition seeking details of cases against PTI leader,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday observed that the manner in which Sindh police conducted itself was unprofessional and reflected a lack of independence and autonomy in the force.
While disposing of a petition seeking details of cases against provincial president of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Haleem Adil Sheikh, the SHC further said that a common man’s faith in the criminal justice system was at rock bottom and such conduct of police would further erode such confidence in the system.
The single-judge bench, headed by Justice Omar Sial, also directed the provincial police officer to ensure that the force he commanded always followed the law with complete independence and autonomy.
Hassan Adil Shaikh, son of the PTI leader, had petitioned the SHC in May, seeking directive for police to inform the court how many cases were registered against his father.

Disposes of petition seeking details of cases against PTI leader

The bench in its order said that one could disagree with the political ideology of Mr Sheikh and the path he chose to appease his party and, perhaps, in a quest to gain prominence within the party and intentionally, resorted to a conduct which may very well be categorised as breach of penal code making him answerable on several counts, but being a citizen of Pakistan, he was entitled to the fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Constitution and the same could only be suspended in accordance with the Constitution and law.
After going through the history of such FIRs, the bench said it was evident that Mr Sheikh had a case to answer, but the manner and the timing of his arrests and re-arrests were unusual, to say the least.
“There are indications of a modus operandi deployed by the Sindh police, the intent of which seems to be to keep Sheikh behind bars for as long as period as possible,” it added.
It also noted that for such reason, police had repeatedly arrested him after he had been admitted to bail and the cases in which his arrest was required, though known to police, were being disclosed in shifts to him.
“The manner in which the Sindh police has conducted itself is unprofessional and, if not malafide, certainly reflects a lack of independence and autonomy. The Sindh police must not forget that the common’s faith in the criminal justice system is at rock bottom, and such conduct from the Sindh police further erodes the common man’s confidence in the system”, the order said.
The detained PTI leader has been booked and arrested in all the FIRs against him and unless a law enforcement agency registers another case, there also seem to be no pending investigations in which he could be arrested, it added.
The bench deposed of the petition and said that the requisite information had been provided to the lawyer for petitioner and he had made no further prayer.

Shah told media persons at the residence of columnist Muhammad Khan Abro here on Tuesday that opposition parties had no candidates in Sindh to contest general election against PPP.
He said that People of Punjab were upset with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, hence PPP was poised to win a large number of seats in the province paving the way for the party to form government in centre.
He said that Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification for life was wrong ab initio. Hence, the question of lifelong disqualification must arise now, he said.
He said that PPP had worked so hard for people in Sindh hence no rival party would be able to field candidates in general election 2024. As far as the economy was concerned, PML-N was squarely responsible for it as all the ministries were held by the party, he said.
Shah claimed that people in Punjab were also disappointed in Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as they had experienced PTI’s bad governance as well. They opposed Imran Khan’s dictatorship and ended his dictatorial regime, he said. 
He said that PPP had not had a level playing field in general elections. PTI leader’s nomination forms had been rejected because he was involved in May 9 incidents, he said.
He said that when PTI founder was prime minister, he took a wrong decision by giving shelter to Afghan refugees in Pakistan and “we are currently facing bad consequences of that decision”.
He said that he was contesting for PS-77 in general elections. The candidates whose nomination papers had been rejected should field appeal with the Election Tribunal to have their candidatures restored, he advised.
He said that everyone had freedom to participate in the election, there were more than 12 candidates fighting against him.
Shah said that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was killed judicially and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari would fulfill the dream of his martyred mother, Benazir Bhutto. PPP would build houses for 2.1 million flood victims, he said.

The enraged protesters gathered on Quetta Road, and set old tyres and junk items on fire, suspending the vehicular traffic.
They were raising charged slogans against Sui gas officials who, according to them, had made their life miserable with the loadshedding and low gas pressure in the district.
Holding gas bills in their hands, Muhammad Safar, Dar Muhammad, Ilyas Manjhu, Mai Heeran, Musmat Sharifan and others, residents of Gulab Machi village, said they paid the bills on time, even then their village like many other villages across the district had been awaiting gas supply.
Some of them told local reporters that despite paying gas bills on time, domestic consumers had been facing severe problems in the extreme cold as the gas department had suspended supply to their village for the past several months.
They added that they had been frequenting the gas office, but no one listened to their grievances there.
The protesters demanded of the officials concerned to take notice of their protest, otherwise, they would extend its scope unless the gas supply was resumed to Gulab Machi village.

A meeting of the party leaders chaired by the SUP president Syed Zain Shah here said the party had no trust in the ROs appointed in Sindh because they were partial. The ROs were showing open biasness during scrutiny of candidatures as they did during local government elections, said the meeting.
The meeting expressed concern over the ROs’ attitude and said transparent elections could not be held in their presence as the bureaucracy was on the payroll of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). 
The meeting asserted that all former ministers, advisers and MPAs as well as officers were busy providing protocol and running election campaign in government vehicles.
The funds of local government departments were being spent on election campaign and LG representatives, including chairmen and LG employees were expending funds at their disposal on PPP’s candidates, it said.
The meeting said that Pakistan was facing economic and political instability and any government formed without accountability would be doomed.
