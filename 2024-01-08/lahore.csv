They celebrate it to show unabashedly to the world that it rightly...,"They have killed their language. Not just that. They celebrate it to show unabashedly to the world that it rightly deserved to be extinct as if it was an aberration. Who are they? They can’t be Pashtun, Baloch and Sindhi. All these people are normal human beings which simply means that each group has its language, the language that is natural to it and loves to use it. Pitted against them are Punjabis, Punjabi Muslims, to be exact, who as Punjabis are historically a distinct ethnic group but have come to insist that they are an ahistorical one.  
If one challenges such a notion of their selfhood, they present another scenario; they are a product of unique historical conditions. They are a precious legacy bequeathed by Muslim invasions which they call Muslim conquests. Who came riding the crest of glory to their land? None other than Arabs from the south (Sindh) and Turks from the north (present day Afghanistan). And they were generals of kings and warlords who in their imperial thrust invaded Punjab not out of some pious motives but rather for their lust for wealth and assets.  
Saints and scholars entered the vanquished land later in safe environment that protected them, but simultaneously strengthened the grip of foreign ruling clique.
From the process of conversion emerged the Punjab’s local elite, which was substantially less than elite. It developed the habit of aping the foreign Muslim masters in matters of cultural values and social mores. An outlandish display of self-negation was highly visible in the local clique’s changing relationship with their mother language in the process of self-alienation triggered by foreign cultural avalanche. It developed contempt for what came from the past with a view to cozying up to its new masters. Such a new outlook prompted loathing even for the things which posed no threat to its new faith. One such thing was their language which was not in contradiction to their religious belief. The irony of the situation was lost on them as they were unable to realise that invaders loved their languages; Arabs loved their Arabic and Turks had deep affection for Persian. Persian of Turks and Iranians did not make them lesser Muslims. But Muslim Punjabi clique treated its language as if it dissuaded them from holding fast to their new religion.
Language if looked at historically shows us that it’s bigger and stronger than faith; it can be a receptacle of multiple faiths and yet be what it is, a language not constricted by the confines of a particular faith. Arab Christians and Arab Jews and Arab Muslims speak the same language.
Luckily, there were poets, saints, Sufis and Gurus of local linage and foreign extraction who saved the Punjabi language to an extent by making it a vehicle of their literary expressions in order to get connected with the masses. That’s the golden period of Punjabi literature (1100 to 1900 CE).  
The colonial occupation of the Punjab in 1849 accentuated the ongoing process of self-alienation which suited and still suits the invaders of every political or religious hue. That being rooted makes one strong, know all the invaders; Aryans Arabs, Turks, British and Americans. That’s why invaders’ first assault is on the language(s) of the vanquished aiming at blurring their historical memory.  
First and foremost, it is the language which preserves and protects the collective memory and identity of a group. The commissioner of Delhi joining the debate on the issue of language in the Punjab wrote to the government of the Punjab in 1862; “Any measure which would revive Goormukhee, which is the written Punjabi tongue, would be a political error.” He further says that such an act would revive the memory of their historical identity. Despite the cogent arguments presented by an enlightened officer J. Wilson, Deputy Commissioner of Shahpur (it was district headquarters of the area including Sargodha) for adopting Punjabi, for example, it was rejected as the language of education for political reasons.  
He writes: “I wish to draw attention to what I consider to be serious faults in our system of primary education in the Punjab, and suggest improvements. (1) It fails to attract more than a small proportion of the boys we wish to educate, and especially of those belonging to the agricultural classes, in which I include not only land-owners and tenants, but also artisans and village menials-- (2) It is conducted for the most part in a language foreign to the people. To an ordinary village boy, Urdu is almost as foreign as French would be to an English rustic. The Punjabi boy is not taught to read the language he speaks, but a language many of the words in which he does not understand until they are translated for him into his own Punjabi.” 
Arrogance laced colonial ignorance coupled with ‘Hindustani prejudice’ blocked the way of development of Punjabi language.  
Dr. Leitner, a great educationist and the Principal of Government College Lahore, exposed this colonial shenanigan when he wrote in 1882: “The British found it more convenient to carry on official business in English and Urdu with their existing skills. They shared the prejudice of Hindustanis.” The prejudice was against the Punjabi language. This ‘prejudice of Hindustanis’ has been internalised by Punjabi ruling clique. It has now morphed into a ‘Punjabi prejudice’ against the Punjabi language in the wake of the Pakistan Movement. The things have come to such a pass! And times, to borrow words from poet Bulleh Shah, are so topsy-turvy that unnatural has become natural in homes and bazaar i.e. the suppression of Punjabi, the natural language of the Punjab.  
In classical Sanskrit plays, we see the male protagonists talking to their peers in Sanskrit. They switch from Sanskrit to Prakrit when they converse with their women and servants. “At the very least, the male Sanskritists had to be bilingual in order to talk to their wives and servants and children,” writes Wendy Doniger in her book The Hindus. Now it’s other the way round. English and Urdu speaking males at times can talk in Punjabi in their informal gatherings but speak to their staff and servants in Urdu. Women invariably speak Urdu which is alien somewhat like Sanskrit. Quite the opposite of what happens in Sanskrit plays.  
The murder of language is murder of history and culture and all that constitutes historical identity of an ethnic group. But among the Punjabis there is neither a feeling of shame or sense of loss. They stalk the land that’s dead and gone. — soofi01@hotmail.com

Following a complaint of robbery, police claimed, they rushed to Adda Saran where the robbers opened indiscriminate fire on the policemen. The police retaliated and an exchange of firing started between them and the suspects. Later, police recovered a robber in injured condition while his four accomplices managed to escape.

3,"LGH, PINS heads at daggers drawn over infrastructure, resources",CM forms committee to resolve the matter amicably,"LAHORE: The principal of the Lahore General Hospital (LGH) and the executive director of the Punjab Institute of Neuro Sciences (PINS) have locked horns over the jurisdiction of some land/departments and utilisation of resources, prompting the caretaker chief minister Punjab to intervene and hand over the matter to a high-level committee to bring both of the officials ‘on the same page’. 
The matter reached the CM Secretariat when the dispute intensified and heads of both institutes claimed that the said departments and infrastructure belonged to their hospitals and they would not backtrack from their positions. The situation remained tense at both the health facilities during the last many weeks, interrupting the smooth functioning of the healthcare to the patients. 
On the directions of Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the health secretary constituted a seven-member committee on Sunday. Headed by Punjab caretaker health minister Prof Javed Akram, the committee comprises Postgraduate Medical Institute (PGMI) & LGH Principal Prof Sardar Al-Fareed Zafar, PINS Executive Director Prof Dr Asif Bashir, ex-principal of PGMI Prof Ghiasun Nabi Tayyab, ex-ED of PINS Prof Khalid Mehmood, the special secretary health (operations) and additional secretary development. 
The committee shall ascertain the workload of the institutes for determining the appropriate utilisation of resources. 

CM forms committee to resolve the matter amicably

“The committee shall furnish a comprehensive solution regarding the demarcation of the administrative areas between both the institutes”, reads the notification. 
It stated that the committee shall also propose short-term measures for optimal and smooth service delivery for the patients in terms of necessary relocation of resources. 
There are reports that the committee would hold its first meeting today (on Monday). 
On the other hand an official, privy to the development, said the dispute between the two institutes was not new one as both sides had been in the conflict since the establishment of PINS many years back. He said the PINS administration had been complaining with the passage of time that the LGH management was utilising its resources and the same allegations were leveled by the LGH against it. 
The issue again came to the limelight when Prof Dr Asif Bashir took charge of PINS as its executive director and he was under pressure from his senior faculty and other doctors who complained that the neuro institute had insufficient space to run the healthcare treatment and the departments. He took up the matter with the LGH administration, claiming that the teaching hospital (LGH) was using premises of PINS even after establishment of the separate government institute. 
According to some reports, the PINS management has also occupied some rooms of the LGH by unlocking them and the step had brought both the institutes to the verge of clash some months back. 
Recently, the official said, the PINS executive director asked the LGH management to vacate a block which was housing its surgical units II and III, claiming that the building was in the administrative control of the institute. 
LGH Principal Prof Al-Fareed Zafar resisted the move, saying that the block belonged to his institute and any such move might create risk of derecognition of the teaching hospital. 
Prof Bashir further claimed that before the establishment of PINS, there were six wards of the neurosurgery and they were occupied by the LGH without prior intimation to his institute.  
He took up the matter with the CM, saying both the LGH and PINS were located on the 216 kanal land. Of them, PINS was housing 500 beds on only 11 kanal land while the 1,500-bed LGH was occupying the rest (most of the part). 
The official said the PINS head conveyed that he wanted to establish a state-of-the-art spine centre and paeds neuro department to expand the scope of treatment for the neuro patients and that his institute required space. 
In response to the claim and justification of the PINS head, the PGMI principal was of the view that any ‘encroachment’ by the institute might inflict dent to the teaching status of the LGH. According to him, the official said, 150 doctors, including senior medical teachers, were discharging duties while the disputed block was also housing an advanced laparoscopy centre, the only one in any state-run hospital of Lahore. 
The medics are getting training at the centre and refused to hand over the premises to the PINS, he said.

4,Polio drive targeting over 22m Punjab children begins today,"LAHORE: The first National Immunization Days (NIDs) of 2024 will commence on Monday (today) all over Punjab,...","LAHORE: The first National Immunization Days (NIDs) of 2024 will commence on Monday (today) all over Punjab, confirmed the head of the polio programme and Punjab Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Coordinator Mr Khizer Afzaal here on Sunday.
In Lahore, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad, the campaign will continue for seven days, while in other districts it will last five days.
The coordinator says that over 200,000 polio workers and supervisors will participate in the drive to immunize 22.50 million children under the age of five against polio.
The officials taking part in the drive include 16,605 area in-charges, 3,991 union council medical officers, over 84,884 mobile polio team members, 4,884 fixed team members and over 2,664 transit team members.
The EOC coordinator directed the districts to make polio campaign a success, saying the first national campaign of the year will lay a strong foundation for a polio-free year and eventually eradication of the virus.
“It is imperative that we start the year with a strong campaign and continue the momentum against the virus. Amid polio virus circulation in other provinces, Punjab has not reported any polio case since October 2020, which is an achievement of the programme”, he says.
The positivity rate of polio environmental samples has also gone down by 1 per cent, Afzaal says, adding that because of successful implementation of polio campaigns, samples from all environmental sites have turned negative.
However, the movement of population from core reservoirs to Punjab is one the major causes of virus importation in the province, cautions the coordinator.
The Punjab polio programme head praised polio workers, saying that they have been reaching out to the children in some of the hardest to reach areas with to cover every child with the polio vaccine and ensure a polio-free world for future generations.
He also warns the workers against showing complacency in executing the programme as the country can’t afford to let polio virus return to the population-wise largest province.
Mr Afzaal says the Punjab government, through health department, is ensuring the safety and security of “our front line heroes’.
“Government and health department have pledged to make all out efforts to provide essential support to the workers and facilitate them during unforeseen challenges”, he says.
The coordinator reiterates that multiple doses of polio drops offer the best protection against the virus, highlighting the need to vaccinate every single child to achieve population immunity and prevent virus circulation.
“Parents must welcome polio teams whenever they come and knock at their doorsteps. Local communities must be reassured that immunisation is a safe and effective means of safeguarding their children against this virus. 2024 is the year when Pakistan aims to interrupt transmission of polio virus in the country and the polio programme is working steadily towards that goal”, the EOC head says.

Looming poverty, unemployment and limited access to balanced diet for most of the rural population has resulted in deficiencies and imbalances in the intake of energy and nutrients which is resulting in stunting (low height), wasting (low weight) and micro-nutrients deficiencies.
According to the National Nutritional Status of Children survey conducted in 2018, there were 40.2pc of the children aged 0-59 months who stunted, 17.7pc wasted, 28.9pc were underweight. To address the malnutrition in children and pregnant and lactating mothers, the Nashonuma Programme was launched by the health department in collaboration with the BISP and WFP in all 158 districts of the country.In Chiniot, 7114 pregnant and lactating women and children aged 0-59 months whose mothers were beneficiaries of the BISP, were registered. They are now being provided antenatal and postnatal health care through a network of 424 lady health workers (LHWs), 33 basic health units, three rural health centres, two tehsil headquarter hospitals and a district headquarter hospital.
District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer Dr Sohail Tariq told Dawn that the department is identifying pregnant women (beneficiaries of BISP) through door-to- door surveys by LHWs. They have also started a free ambulance service 1034 having a network of 11 ambulances to transfer pregnant women to nearby health facility where doctors examine them and conduct ultrasound. They are given necessary medication, food supplements before shifting to home.
Each woman gets a cash transfer of Rs 3,000 though her registered Jazz account.
“The antenatal care has helped us in conducting safe deliveries at public sector health facilities. There were 16,102 deliveries carried out during year 2023 and none of the fatality of mother or the newborn was reported,” Mr Sohail Tariq said.
Moreover, children aged 0-59 months whose mothers were registered beneficiaries were also registered under this programme. They were provided food supplement packs on a monthly basis.Muhammad Asif Raza, Deputy Commissioner/Administrator of DHA, told Dawn the health authority was also focusing on elimination of other reasons of stunting which included frequent infections, poor hygiene and sanitation, lack of safe drinking water, household food insecurity, poverty, minimum acceptable diet, poor birth spacing, poor maternal nutrition, low maternal education.”We are providing awareness to mothers to prevent their children against frequent infections, improving health and hygiene in rural areas through special campaigns under “Chamkain Gay Dehat”.

Muhammad Adil was traveling from Lahore to Kasur in his car. When he reached near the village Paki Havali, the car stopped due to running out of petrol. Meanwhile, two robbers on a motorcycle held Adil at gunpoint, and shot him when he resisted. 
He was initially taken to the Kasur DHQ Hospital and later referred to Lahore General Hospital in critical condition.
The assailants fled and the police have started investigation of the incident.
LAND RETRIEVED: The district administration claimed to have reclaimed valuable land from influential land grabbers in the village of Raja Jang, within the jurisdiction of Raja Jang police, 20 kilometres from Kasur.
The 10 kanals, estimated at about Rs150 million, were recovered from the grabbers, says a press release issued by the district administration. However, the press release did not provide information about the identities of the influential land grabbers or any legal actions taken against them.
As a common practice, administrations retrieve land but often refrain from taking legal action against influential grabbers. 
The administration typically does not impose heavy fines on grabbers to deter them or set an example. Instead, grabbers, often with political backing, go unpunished, enabling them to seize additional pieces of state land.

IMRAN KHAN: An appellate tribunal at Rawalpindi seat of the LHC reserved its verdict on an appeal of PTI founding chairman Imran Khan against rejection of his nomination papers from NA-89 of Mianwali.
Earlier, Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar completed his arguments on behalf of the former prime minister.  
He said the RO, in the impugned decision, unlawfully relied on a decision by an Islamabad sessions court regarding the conviction of the appellant in Toshakhana case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Asked as if the appellant had disclosed the gifts of Toshakhana, the lawyer said he was not discussing the merits of the Toshakhana case. He argued that the disqualification under Article 63 (1) (h) of the Constitution does not stand after the suspension of the sentence.
He pointed out that the sentence of the appellant in the Toshakhana case had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.
The tribunal comprising Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz would announce the verdict on Jan 10, the last day of deciding appeals against the decisions of the returning officers.  
Hearing of an appeal against the rejection of Imran Khan’s nomination papers from NA-122, Lahore, could not be held before an appellate tribunal at the principal seat due to paucity of time.
The tribunal is likely to hear the appeal on Monday (today).

As per the police, the suspect Arbaz Khan, a resident of Mankera, Bhakkar district, contacted Zafar Iqbal, an expat who ran a travel agency in Saudi Arabia, on a social media platform, introduced himself as a senior superintendent of police (SSP) and developed good terms with him.
Later, Arbaz told Zafar that his sister and  a cousin were visiting Saudi Arabia, asking him to take care of them. Zafar  obliged Arbaz and hosted his relatives.
According to the complainant, the suspect remained in contact with him and would many times appear in police uniform during video calls. 
The complainant said that once the suspect asked him if he could bring a costly watch, a mobile phone set and a laptop during his next visit to Pakistan, promising to pay him the price of these items.

16,LDA’s hockey stadium to be leased for sustainability,LAHORE: Lahore Development Authority’s (LDA) governing body has approved a proposal to lease out the Johar Town...,"LAHORE: Lahore Development Authority’s (LDA) governing body has approved a proposal to lease out the Johar Town Hockey Stadium — a major sports facility of international standard — in a bid to run it in a professional and sustainable manner. The need to outsource to facility was felt after its management committee failed to run it under professional and self-sustainable model, Dawn has learnt.
According to a document available with Dawn, the hockey stadium in Johar Town (D-II block, Khayaban-e-Firdausi) was constructed in 2012 by the LDA to facilitate the government revive and promote hockey with the budget amounting to Rs45.410 million after approval by the governing body in a meeting held on March 31, 2012.
After completion, in order to run the affairs of the stadium efficiently, an honorary management committee was constituted by LDA in a meeting held on Dec 6, 2012 on the directions of the then chief minister. The body consisted of Olympian Chaudhry Akhtar Rasool, and the then directors general (DGs) of LDA and Sports Department.
The committee in its first meeting decided to run the stadium as self-sustained project and all efforts will be made to make it a successful venture. However, the stadium could not be run under a self-sustainable model. Moreover, the management committee kept requesting the government for provision of financial grants from LDA time to time to run the affairs of the facility.
In the fiscal year 2012-13, the LDA, on the request of committee, provided funds amounting to Rs4.80 million, followed by another Rs4.80 million provided in 2014-15. In 2015-16 and 2016-17 fiscal years, the LDA provided Rs4 million, thus the total funds the committee obtained were amounting to Rs17.60 million.
“It was observed that despite financial support extended by LDA on different occasions, the hockey stadium suffered financial losses and is still in feeble condition to establish itself a sustainable venture. In view of the circumstances, the LDA authority in its meeting on May 5, 2021 decided to dissolve the management committee and directed to carryout repair and up-gradation works of the stadium,” read minutes of a very recent meeting of the LDA governing body presided over by caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
According to proposal narrated in the meeting, presently all repair and maintenance activities have been completed. Similarly, all utility bills have also been paid. Therefore, in order to revive the national game of Pakistan and operate the stadium under a sustainable model, the stadium should be outsourced/leased to a professional organisation that can run it on self-sustainable manner through transparent / competitive manner.

18,"Low yield, import issues behind record surge in cotton prices","LAHORE: Cotton prices in the local market have registered a record increase during the last week, apparently because...","LAHORE: Cotton prices in the local market have registered a record increase during the last week, apparently because of a significant and ‘unexpected’ drop in the domestic production and problems in the import of lint from abroad.
Last week, cotton rates went up by Rs1,500 per maund to reach the mark of Rs20,000 per maund, the highest price during the last four and a half months.
Observers expect the rates are set to go further up because of limited availability of quality cotton in the domestic market and a significant fall in the local cotton production against the projections in Punjab.
Karachi Cotton Brokers Forum chairman Naseem Usman says textile mills remained active in the purchase of quality lint in the local cotton market during the first week of the new year that pushed the prices up. He says that trade volume was also better as compared with the last few weeks.
He believes that the cotton production report by the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association basically played a role in a bullish trend in the market as it confirmed that the crop output by the season end might not cross the 8.5million bales mark against the revised target of 11.15m bales.
The PCGA statistics suggest that the country may need to import 4.0m bales to meet requirements of the local textile industry, which consumes around 15m bales per annum.
Cotton Ginners Forum chairman Ihsanul Haq says domestic cotton prices increased by a record Rs1,500 due to limited availability of the commodity in the market and he expects that the price increase trend will continue in the coming weeks.
He recalls that at the beginning of the ongoing crop year, cotton prices reached Rs23,000 per maund, the highest level in the country’s history, before falling to Rs17,000 per maund due to certain reasons, including lower domestic output against the figures projected by the agriculture authorities.
Haq says that as of Dec 31, 2023 Pakistan produced only 8.17m bales, which has raised concerns that the total production of cotton this year will be less than 8.5m bales. Meanwhile, due to certain global issues, including the attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, there are problems in the import of cotton by sea, he adds.
This has sent the domestic cotton market into bullish mode as the Karachi Cotton Association made a record increase of Rs1,300 per maund in the spot rate of cotton during the last week.
As a record 272 textile mills from Pakistan are participating in the Heimtextil, an international textile fair starting from Tuesday (January 9) in Frankfurt, Germany, it is expected that they will get a good number of export orders for various textile products.
Mr Haq says that this factor, plus the continuing trend of China making lint purchases from the United States, Pakistan will further add to the prices in the domestic cotton market.
He says that cotton growers are happy with the bullish trend as the prices of phutti (raw cotton) in different markets have gone up to Rs9,400 per maund and this may help persuade them to sow the crop next year, hoping good profits.
However, if the present cold wave continues for some more time, it may delay cotton cultivation in areas where the process starts in the second or third week of February, Haq fears.
