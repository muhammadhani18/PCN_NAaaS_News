0,Fresh cold snap expected from Tuesday,"While temperatures may dip, likelihood of single-digit readings remains low","Residents are gearing up for another spell of chilly weather as a fresh wave of cold is anticipated to hit the city from Tuesday onwards.
Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has predicted that the cold winds, blowing faster than usual, will escalate the intensity of the cold, causing the minimum temperature to plummet to around 10 degrees.
On Sunday, the city witnessed a notable drop in temperatures, with the minimum temperature recorded at 13.5 degrees and a maximum of 26.5 degrees Celsius.
The PMD Early Warning Centre has forecasted the onset of a new cold wave on Tuesday, attributing the heightened cold intensity to strong northeast/easterly winds.
The PMD Chief Sardar Sarfraz has said that the recent western system brought cold winds, affecting the city.

While the temperatures may dip, the likelihood of single-digit readings remains low. Sarfraz noted another western system expected to enter Balochistan by the end of the month, hinting at further weather changes. However, the morning fog had disrupted the visibility.
The winter in the port city, though mild as compared with the northern parts of the country, is enough to send people racing to food streets to enjoy coffee, soup and Gajar Ka Halwa.
The used clothing stalls in downtown are also doing a roaring business.
Motorcyclists, in particular, need heavy jackets to fend themselves against cold blasts of wind at night.
Moreover, biker families can be seen carrying babies in cutest of woolies like rompers depicting fairies and cartoon characters.

1,PPP faces formidable alliance in Sindh,GDA leaders confident of winning majority of seats and forming coalition govt in province,"As the swiftly approaching General Elections scheduled for February 8, 2024, draw near and new alliances take shape in Sindh, the pivotal question surfaces whether the newfound alliances will make inroads into the stronghold of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), ruling the province for the last three consecutive terms?
The recent meetings between Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader and former prime minister Shahbaz Sharif, leaders of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) led by Pir Pagara, and Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQMP) to form an election alliance have stirred concerns among PPP ranks.
The critics within the party are characterising this move as an attempt to shrink its mandate as it was done in the 1990s and 2000s.
As political opponents strategise to defeat the ruling party in Sindh, PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and other party leaders are actively recruiting electables, specifically the influential figures residing in Sindh, with the aim of maximising the party's vote share.
Recent additions to the party's ranks include the Mahars of Ghotki led by Ali Gohar Mahar and the Mahar of Shikarpur led by former federal minister Ghous Bux Mahar, both of whom were previously affiliated with GDA and considered arch-rivals of PPP.
Other notable additions include Dr Amir Abbas Soomro, the grandson of Allah Bux Soomro, Aslam Abro of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), who defeated a PPP candidate in the last general election from Jacobabad, and MQM leaders Raza Haroon and Advocate Anees, along with Dr Sikandar Shoro of Jamshoro, among others.
According to informed sources, PPP also attempted to engage with former chief ministers Liaquat Ali Jatoi and Arbab Ghulam Rahim, but negotiations between them failed to materialise.
Furthermore, political analysts acknowledge the challenge of defeating the PPP's rule in Sindh in the current scenario. However, they believe that a joint strategy by the anti-PPP political alliance could significantly impact the party.
Citing the PPP's track record of the past 15 years, marked by governance issues, lawlessness, poor infrastructure, and a failure to uphold the party's core principles, pundits suggest that an effective alliance could exploit these weaknesses.

A senior writer Dr Ali Rind said that the lack of transparency in Sindh's elections, stating that the process is often managed by electables with the assistance of government officials. Despite the challenges, he acknowledges the party's established network at the district level, emphasising that political alliances may struggle to overcome its influence.
Zulfiqar Halepoto, a writer, political analyst and environmentalist, contends that the PPP is at risk of losing some seats, including its stronghold in Larkana. Consequently, the party has strategically fielded Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari from Kamber Shahdadkot seat NA 196.
""In the last general election, the Rashid Soomro of JUI-F gave a tough time to Bilawal in Larkana which is why the party has decided to field him in two seats one in Larkana and other Kamber. If Bilawal loses from Larkana, he can win from Kamber with the help of two feudal lords of party belonging to Chandio and Magsi tribes,"" he said adding that for the first time, the PPP leaders was not contesting the election from Lyari, that has been its stronghold apparently because they are scared of losing the seat too as it was done in last election.
On the other hand, Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) leaders express confidence that they would form the coalition government in Sindh by winning the majority seats. ""PPP has done nothing, but promote corruption, nepotism and bad governance. The 15 years performance especially the post flood situation is blot on its face as it has completely neglected the poor people who lost everything in 2022 rains,"" GDA leader, Sardar Rahim said.
Talking about the former prime minister Shahbaz Sharif's meeting with Pir Pagara, he said that they would make an election alliance with help of MQM and can form the coalition government in Sindh. Responding to Shahbaz Sharif's meeting with Pir Pagara and MQM, Saeed Ghani of PPP said that the 10-party election alliance in the last general election had faced the defeat and again, PPP would defeat them winning two third majority from Sindh.
""Those Sindhi nationalists who used to criticise MQM and PML N have now joined the anti-PPP alliance too. It has been difficult for them to win even the UC election, so how can they defeat the PPP in the province,"" Ghani said.
The upcoming polls in Sindh promise a riveting political spectacle, with the PPP fighting to retain its stronghold against a determined opposition seeking to capitalise on perceived weaknesses. Whether the PPP's established network and strategic alliances will withstand the challenge or if the GDA-led coalition can usher in a new era of governance, remains to be seen.

2,"Egg, poultry meat prices rise as mercury drops",Administration silent on arbitrary hike in prices,"With the intensification of the chilly weather condition, the rates of chicken meat and eggs have surged in the city.
The cost of a dozen of eggs has inched up from Rs360 per dozen to Rs400 per dozen in the last few days.
Similarly, the rate of per kilogramme of poultry meat has escalated from Rs550 per kg to Rs620 during the week. Alarmingly, many shopkeepers are selling eggs and chickens at arbitrary prices as per the locality, and the civic administration's efforts to enforce official rates have proven ineffective.
Notably, no official price list is visibly displayed at any chicken shop in the city, and eggs are not being sold at the officially designated prices.
The city administration has, unfortunately, given a free hand to profiteers, ceasing the issuance of official price lists in an attempt to curb overcharging in chicken and egg sales.

Despite the Commissioner Karachi, Muhammad Saleem Rajput, setting the retail price for a dozen eggs at Rs290, this official rate has not been implemented.
Eggs are being sold at Rs110 above the official rates and there is no administrative check.
Shopkeepers argue that the surge in the prices of chicken and eggs at the wholesale level is primarily attributed to the imbalance between supply and demand.
The cold weather has led to an increased demand for eggs and poultry, consequently driving up the prices.

5,Populace far away from electoral process,Karachi’s exorbitant problems require permanent solutions and no one seems to have them,"With general elections now just around the corner, the usual excitement and campaigning is amiss in Karachi; and most of it is down to an absence of hope and the realisation amongst the populace of broken promises of the past.
Be that as it may, Karachi Division is a crown jewel for electoral purposes. The division, which consists of 7 districts, is a battleground for 22 National Assembly seats and 47 Sindh Assembly seats. And current trends suggest that no political party has a majority in the division.
Khawaja Bilal Sethi, a social activist based in the city, feels that this is down to the lack of solutions being presented by political parties to Karachi’s problems.
“The division as a whole faces significant challenges such as lack of jobs and essential facilities, like education and healthcare. Apart from the city, the division is marred with problems like poor infrastructure and a rising crime rate.
Unfortunately, no political party has an answer to any of these issues,” explained Sethi. It is pertinent to mention that it is not just social activists like Sethi who feel that no one can end Karachi’s misery.
Dr Muhammad Ali, an associate professor at the Karachi University, who has a keen eye on the division’s politics, concurring with Sethi, was of the view that the only stopgap solution for the division’s problems was for all of its political stakeholders to work together.
However, with such unity seemingly impossible, Dr Ali predicted that no single party would secure a majority in the division and that votes would be distributed between parties based on factors such as language, community, and ethnicity.

Senior political analyst, Muneeruddin, agrees with the associate professor’s prediction. “Presently, no single party can achieve a clear majority in the political and electoral landscape of Karachi.
Even the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which has been in power for more than a decade in the province, cannot claim to be popular in the division.
If the PPP was popular, its Chairman, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and other central party leaders, would have contested the election from here,” he asserted. “Like the rest of the country, the tanking economy has taken a toll on everyone, and therefore people are not interested in the electoral process. The populace lacks hope and is aware of the broken promises of the past,” added Muneeruddin.
Even if the political stakeholders of the division were to start a robust election campaign and offer some semblance of hope the populace, it is unlikely that people will turn up to vote come election day, according to Dr Sabir Michael, a senior social affairs expert. “Karachi is presently a hub of problems and no one is sincere enough to solve them.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the division’s populace will be interested in voting for any particular party. It is also unlikely that whoever is in government will promptly address the division’s issues,” cautioned Dr Michael, while talking to The Express Tribune.

6,WASA development work triggers business woes,Repercussions of sewage system disruption felt beyond Tulsidas Pumping Station,"The ongoing development work by the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) to interconnect the 32-inch diameter rising main line from Tulsidas, the general bus stop, commonly known as Badin bus stop, has led to significant issues on the Haali Road.
The drainage system at the Tulsidas Sewerage Pumping Station was adversely affected, resulting in the overflow of dirty water from drains and sewers in the surrounding areas.
The repercussions of the sewage system disruption were felt beyond Tulsidas Pumping Station, with dirty water accumulating in other sections of the road during the afternoon. Similarly, the sewage water gathered on Alamgir Cantt Road, heading from Hyderabad city to Latifabad.

The accumulation of dirty water on the main highways around the pumping station caused severe traffic disruptions and intermittent traffic jams. Owing to the accumulated water, the business activities suffered, particularly the water under the Sakhi Wahab flyover and beyond the Makki Shah police station.
The dirty water on roads forced many shopkeepers to close their businesses prematurely. Due to the sewage on central highways, citizens faced transportation challenges, leading some motorists to opt for alternative routes.
The media cell of WASA had issued a statement on Wednesday, indicating that the interconnection of the main would take place from January 5 to 7. This initiative aimed to address long-standing sewage issues near key business centres of city.
Despite prior notification of potential drainage disruptions, citizens and shopkeepers expressed surprise at the lack of proactive measures. They argued that alternative drainage systems should have been arranged for the three-day period

9,10-km protest march held against corporate farming,Awami Tehreek says agricultural revolution possible only by distributing land among peasants,"The Awami Tehreek (AT) organised a 10-kilometer protest march in Thatta district on Sunday to express opposition to the auction of over a million acres of agricultural land in Sindh.
The participants, led by the party's President Lal Jarwar, deplored that precious land of Sindh will be given for corporate farming under the guise of agriculture revolution which is in essence only possible by distributing land among landless peasants.
AT activists, who claim to be the true followers of late Rasool Bux Palijo rather than his son, Ayaz LAtif Palijo, walked for several kilometers, also demanded removal of encroachment from Keenjhar and Haleji lakes; Kohistan and Bhanbhor; and from the coastal regions.
They kept raising slogans like 'stop land grabbing', 'deny corporate farming', 'stop auction of Keenjhar Lake' and 'stop auction of Karoonjhar Hills'. ""The rulers have distorted the secular and democratic Pakistan of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,"" said Jarwar while addressing the protesters.

He said the rulers did not learn any lesson from the 1971 debacle, adding that the local people are being forced out of their abodes because their lands are being occupied in Thatta district.
He blamed the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) for allowing its former provincial government to sell thousands of thousand acres of land in Thatta to international companies. He alleged that tens of thousands of acres of land had been forcefully acquired for mega housing schemes.
He warned that the K-IV project is a death warrant for Keenjhar as the lake's water will be diverted to the housing schemes and the people of Thatta will be deprived of their water share.
""The rulers of Sindh have attacked Sindh's national identity by destroying Sindh's natural lakes and tourist and cultural sites."" The AT's Noor Ahmed Katiyar, Hoorunnisa Palijo and other leaders warned that the people of the province will resist the projects which are meant to grab their land.
