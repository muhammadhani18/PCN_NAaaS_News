0,‘Sham’ election in Bangladesh keeps Sheikh Hasina in power,"PM calls opposition BNP a ""terrorist organisation"" as turnout remains low.","DHAKA: Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has won re-election for a fifth time, following an opposition boycott, with her party taking at least half of seats and counting ongoing, an election official said.
“The ruling Awami League party has won more than 50 per cent seats,” an Election Commission spokesman said.
However, election officials were still cou­nting votes on Sunday when the official declared her victor amid a boycott of opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party that she branded a “terrorist organisation”.
Ms Hasina’s government has been accused of rampant human rights abuses and a ruthless opposition crackdown. Her party faced almost no effective rivals in the seats it contested, but it avoided fielding candidates in a few constituencies, an apparent effort to avoid the legislature being branded a one-party institution.
The opposition BNP, whose ranks have been decimated by mass arrests, called a general strike and urged the public not to participate in what it called a “sham” election.
 







PM calls opposition BNP a ‘terrorist organisation’ as turnout remains low

But Ms Hasina, 76, called for citizens to show faith in the democratic process. “The BNP is a terrorist organisation,” she told reporters after casting her vote. “I am trying my best to ensure that dem­ocracy should continue in this country.”
‘Why would I go to vote?’
Results are expected as early as Monday (today) morning, with television channels broadcasting early counts from several polling stations putting ruling party candidates ahead.
Chief Election Commissioner Habibul Awal told reporters the turnout, based on preliminary figures, was around 40 per cent.
There were widespread reports of carrot-and-stick inducements to encourage turnout aimed at bolstering the poll’s legitimacy.
 
 

BNP head Tarique Rahman, speaking from Britain where he lives in exile, said he worried about ballot stuffing. “I fear that the election commission may inc­rease vot­er turnout by using fake votes,” he told AFP.
Many said they had not voted because the outcome was assured. “When one party is participating and another is not, why would I go to vote?” said Mohammad Saidur, 31, who pulls a rickshaw.
“We all know who’s going to win,” said Farhana Manik, 27, a student.
Some voters said earlier they had been threatened with the confiscation of government benefit cards needed to access welfare payments if they refused to cast ballots for the ruling Awami League.
“They said since the government feeds us, we have to vote for them,” Lal Mia, 64, told AFP in the central district of Faridpur.
Fear of ‘further crackdown’
The BNP and other parties staged months of protests last year, demanding Ms Hasina step down ahead of the vote.
Officers in the port city of Chittagong broke up an opposition protest Sunday, firing shotguns and tear gas canisters, but election officials said voting was largely peaceful, with nearly 800,000 police officers and soldiers deployed countrywide.
Meenakshi Ganguly, from Human Rights Watch, said Sunday that the government had failed to reassure opposition supporters that the polls would be fair, warning that “many fear a further crackdown”.
Politics in the world’s eighth-most populous country was long dominated by the rivalry between Ms Hasina, the daughter of the country’s founding leader, and two-time premier Khaleda Zia, wife of a former military ruler.
Ms Hasina has been the decisive victor since returning to power in a 2009 landslide, with two subsequent polls accompanied by widespread irregularities and accusations of rigging.
Ms Zia, 78, was convicted of graft in 2018 and is now in ailing health at a hospital in Dhaka, with her son Tarique Rahman helming the BNP in her stead from London.
Mr Rahman told AFP that his party, along with dozens of others, had refused to participate in a “sham election”.
Ms Hasina has accused the BNP of arson and sabotage during last year’s protest campaign, which was mostly peaceful but saw several people killed in police confrontations.
The government’s security forces have been dogged by allegations of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances — charges it rejects.
The United States, the biggest export market for the South Asian nation of 170 million, has imposed sanctions on an elite police unit and its top commanders.
Economic headwinds have left many dissatisfied with Ms Hasina’s government, after sharp spikes in food costs and months of chronic blackouts in 2022.

1,Death toll of IS-claimed Kabul blast rises to five,"UN mission in Afghanistan says total casualties were at least 25, calling “for an end to targeted attacks on civilians"".","KABUL: The death toll from an attack on a bus in western Kabul claimed by the militant Islamic State (IS) group rose from two to five on Sunday, police said.
Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran gave an initial toll of two dead and 14 wounded in an explosion on a bus in the capital’s Dasht-i-Barchi neighbourhood — an enclave of the historically oppressed Shia Hazara community — on Saturday evening.
In a statement on Sunday, he revised the toll to five dead and 15 wounded, adding that the survivors had been hospitalised and their conditions were stable.
He said the blast was caused by explosives planted on the bus and that “police are still investigating the incident to find the culprits and bring them to justice”.
The UN mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, said the total casualties were at least 25 in a post on social media on Sunday, calling “for an end to targeted attacks on civilians, greater protection for Afghanistan’s Hazara community and accountability for perpetrators”.
Hours after the blast, the regional chapter of the IS group claimed on Telegram that it was behind the explosion, the latest to hit the area in recent months.
In November, at least seven people were killed in an explosion on a bus in Dasht-i-Barchi that was also claimed by IS.
Mohammad Ashraf, a resident of Kabul, had told TOLOnews that several explosions have taken place in the area in the past 10 to 20 days. This explosion is not the first and it will not be the last.“
However, Zabihullah Muj­ahid, the Islamic Emirate’s spokesman, had claimed that investigations into the incident had started.
The number of bomb blasts and suicide attacks in Afghanistan has reduced dramatically since the Taliban ended their insurgency after seizing power in August 2021, ousting the US-backed government.
However, a number of armed groups, including IS, remain a threat.

2,Internet outages hit PTI’s bid to launch manifesto,Spokesperson says document to be revealed in a few days.,"ISLAMABAD: A bid by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) to launch its manifesto for the 2024 general elections and raise funds through a telethon was stymied on Sunday after a total blackout of social media sites was reported throughout the country.
This is the second time in recent months that internet services were disrupted as the PTI planned to host an online event. On Dec 17, the party organised a virtual power show, which also suffered due to a disruption in internet services.
On Sunday, many social media users failed to join the online event through their accounts.
“Live metrics show a nation-scale disruption to social media platforms across Pakistan, including X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube,” internet tracking agency Netblocks said on Sunday evening.
 






Netblocks Director Alp Toker told AFP the disruptions were affecting network providers across the country.

Spokesperson says document to be revealed in a few days

“Such nation-scale social media targeting political activities is almost unprecedented at this scale — Venezuela is one other country that has used similar measures to limit opposition speeches and rallies,” he said.
Over the past few days, the PTI had been creating hype about its manifesto, which was supposed to be launched on Sunday night. However, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan told Dawn that the party would now be able to share its manifesto “after a couple of days”.
Last month, Mr Hasan said that a number of people were contributing to the manifesto document, which would be launched before elections. Former finance minister Shaukat Tarin was one of the key members of the PTI’s manifesto committees, but he parted ways with the party in December 2023.
 






Telethon disrupted
The former ruling party said it had anticipated social media curbs and asked its supporters to attend the telethon through social media sites. But after online disruptions, it urged them to join the transmission via VPN. However, the VPN being shared by PTI representatives required Rs1,999 per month to sign up.
Dawn was able to view a part of the transmission on YouTube. At the time, the virtual event — moderated by Ali Malik and Jibran Ilyas — had an audience of over 7,000 people. Around 10:20pm, it was informed that the party had collected $44,000 and Rs30 million.
 






Erstwhile PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Khan welcomed people and shared a message on behalf of Imran Khan, who is incarcerated in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.
“Imran Khan is in jail to protect your rights… Pakistan’s fate is democracy and we are making efforts for a country in which the judiciary and people would be free, every citizen would get respect and we will achieve our target,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator Sania Nishtar said there were 16 social welfare programmes during the PTI government to support people. “We introduced health cards, a cash transfer programme, and also took steps to address the issue of stunting among children,” she said.
Laiba Dar, daughter of Usman Dar, said that Imran Khan gave a “vision to the youth”. She said that even if her father was forced to quit the party, she and her grandmother would stand by Imran Khan.

3,Maldives suspends ministers over ‘clown’ jibe against Modi,Shiuna had called Modi a “clown” following the prime minister’s visit to the Indian territory of Lakshadweep.," 

Malsha Shareef

MALE: Maldivian Presi­dent Mohamed Muizzu suspended three deputy ministers on Sunday for making “derogatory remarks” against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government said.
Muizzu, who won September elections on promises that included removing a small contingent of Indian troops operating maritime aircraft from his archipelago, banned the deputy ministers — Malsha Shareef, Abdulla Mahzoon and Mariyam Shiuna — from work pending an investigation.
Shiuna had called Modi a “clown” following the prime minister’s visit to the Indian territory of Lakshadweep, a cluster of atolls just north of the Maldives.
The three suspended ministers — all from the youth ministry — criticised Modi on social media, officials said.
“The Maldives government is aware of derogatory remarks on social media platforms against foreign leaders and high ranking individuals,” the official statement added.
“These opinions are personal and do not represent the views of the government of Maldives.”
A senior administrative official claimed that Muizzu had suspended the trio and ordered an investigation. He said Male was concerned about repercussions, as Indians were the largest group of foreign visitors to the Maldives, where tourism accounts for almost one-third of the economy.
On Jan 4, Modi posted on social media praising the “pristine bea­ches” of India’s Lak­shad­weep islands, which lie about 130km north of the Maldives at their closest point. He also posted photos of himself snorkelling, and suggested the islands should be on the must-visit list of any adventure-seeking tourist.
Known as an expensive holiday destination with secluded resorts, the Maldives has also become a geopolitical hotspot.
Global east-west shipping lanes pass the nation’s chain of 1,192 tiny coral islands, stretching around 800km across the equator.
Muizzu, who was seen in elections as a proxy of the pro-China former leader Abdulla Yameen, toned down his anti-Indian rhetoric after coming to power though he said he would not upend the regional balance by replacing Indian forces with Chinese troops.

4,US court prevents California from banning guns at public places,California’s appeal of the injunction will now be heard in April.,"CALIFORNIA: A federal appeals court has allowed a judge’s ruling that barred California from enforcing a new law that bans the carrying of guns in most public places on the grounds that it was unconstitutional to take effect.
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals dissolved an order by a different 9th Circuit panel from a week earlier that suspended an injunction issued by a judge who concluded the Democratic-led state’s law violated the right of citizens to keep and bear arms under the US Constitution’s Second Amendment.
Last week’s order had temporarily stayed the injunction and allowed the law to take effect on Jan 1, but gun rights groups then asked the 9th Circuit to reconsider and a different panel of judges on Saturday finally dissolved the order suspending the injunction.
“So the politicians’ ploy to get around the Second Amendment has been stopped for now,” C.D. Michel, a lawyer for the gun rights groups, said in a statement.

California’s appeal of the injunction will now be heard in April

California’s appeal of the injunction will now be heard in April. The state’s attorney general in court papers had argued “tens of millions of Californians will face a heightened risk of gun violence” if the law was blocked.
“This dangerous decision puts the lives of Califor­nians on the line,” said Daniel Villaseor, a spokesperson for Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who signed the measure into law in September.
The law was enacted after a landmark ruling in June 2022 by the conservative-majority US Supreme Court that expanded gun rights nationwide.
The Supreme Court in that case struck down New York’s strict gun permit regime and declared for the first time that the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment protects a person’s right to carry a handgun in public for self-defence.
The ruling, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association vs Bruen, also set out a new test to assess the 
constitutionality of gun laws by holding they must be “consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” 
California was among a group of states with similar laws as New York, and following the US Supreme Court’s decision moved to revamp its firearms regulations.
Under California’s new law, people could not carry concealed guns in 26 categories of “sensitive places” including hospitals, playgrounds, stadiums, zoos and places of worship, regardless whether they had permits to carry concealed weapons.
The law, Senate Bill 2, also barred people from having concealed guns at privately owned commercial establishments that are open to the public, unless the business operator posts a sign allowing licence holders to carry guns on their property.

5,Private industry leads America’s first Moon landing since Apollo,Peregrine Lunar Lander set to blast off today.,"CAPE CANAVERAL: The first American spacecraft to attempt to land on the Moon in more than half a century is poised to blast off early on Monday — but this time, private industry is leading the charge.
A brand new rocket, United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur, should lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:18am for its maiden voyage, carrying Astro­botic’s Peregrine Lunar Lander. Weather so far appears favourable.
If all goes to plan, Peregrine will touch down on a mid-latitude region of the Moon called Sinus Viscositatis, or Bay of Stickiness, on Feb 23.
“Leading America back to the surface of the Moon for the first time since Apollo is a momentous honor,” Pittsburgh-based Astro­botic’s CEO John Thornton said ahead of the launch.
 







Peregrine Lunar Lander set to blast off today

Until now, a soft landing on Earth’s nearest celestial neighbour has only been accomplished by a handful of national space agencies. The Soviet Union was first, in 1966, followed by the United States, which is still the only country to put people on the Moon.
China has successfully landed three times over the past decade, while India was the most recent to achieve the feat on its second attempt, last year.
Now, the United States is turning to the commercial sector in an effort to stimulate a broader lunar economy and ship its own hardware at a fraction of the cost, under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme.
A challenging task
The space agency has paid Astrobotic more than $100 million for the task, while another contracted company, Houston-based Intuitive Machines, is looking to launch in February and land near the south pole.
“We think that it’s going to allow… more cost effective and more rapidly accomplished trips to the lunar surface to prepare for Artemis,” said Nasa’s Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration.
Artemis is the Nasa-led programme to return astronauts to the Moon later this decade, in preparation for future missions to Mars.
Controlled touchdown on the Moon is a challenging undertaking, with roughly half of all attempts ending in failure. Absent an atmosphere that would allow the use of parachutes, a spacecraft must navigate through treacherous terrain using only its thrusters to slow descent.
Private missions by Israel and Japan, as well as a recent attempt by the Russian space agency have all ended in failure — though the Japanese Space Agency is targeting mid-January for the touchdown of its SLIM lander launched last September.
Making matters more fraught is the fact it is the first launch for ULA’s Vulcan, although the company boasts it has a 100 per cent success rate in its more than 150 prior launches.
ULA’s new rocket is planned to have reusable first-stage booster engines, which the company, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, expects will help it achieve cost savings.
Scientific instruments, human remains
On board Peregrine are a suite of scientific instruments that will probe radiation and surface composition, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts.
But it also contains more colorful cargo, including a shoebox-sized rover built by Carnegie Mellon University, a physical Bitcoin, and, somewhat controversially, cremated remains and DNA, including those of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, legendary sci-fi author and scientist Arthur C. Clarke, and a dog.
The Navajo Nation, America’s largest Indigenous tribe, has said sending these to the Moon desecrates a body that is sacred to their culture and have pleaded for the cargo’s removal. Though they were granted a last-ditch meeting with White House, Nasa and other officials, their objections have been ignored.
The Vulcan rocket’s upper stage, which will circle the Sun after it deploys the lander, is meanwhile carrying more late cast members of Star Trek, as well as hair samples of presidents George Washington, Dwight D Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.
