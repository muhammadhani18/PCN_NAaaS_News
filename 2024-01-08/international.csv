0,Israel cabinet slated to vote on war budget,"JERUSALEM: Israel’s cabinet is set to approve a 2024 wartime budget on Thursday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich...","JERUSALEM: Israel’s cabinet is set to approve a 2024 wartime budget on Thursday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Sunday, after ministers approved 9 billion shekels ($2.5 billion) in financial support for military reservists.
“The state of Israel puts the reservists and their families at the center and this is the anchor of the budget for 2024 that we will deliver this weekend,” Smotrich said in a joint statement with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.
Israel last year approved a two-year budget for 2023 and 2024, but the aggression against Hamas in Gaza has shaken government finances, requiring budget changes and additional spending.
In December parliament approved a special war budget for 2023 of nearly 30 billion shekels to help fund the crisis and compensate those impacted by Oct 7 raid. Smotrich’s spokesman clarified that the budget vote would likely take place on Thursday but offered no further details.
The Finance Ministry has said that the war will likely cost at least another 50 billion shekels in 2024 and result in a near-tripling of its budget deficit to around 6 per cent of GDP, in a projection that fighting will last through February.
The Bank of Israel is urging the government to rein in spending unrelated to the war to balance out the additional defence and home-front expenses, saying looser fiscal policy could slow the pace of interest rate reductions.

1,"Fire leaves 7,000 Rohingya homeless in Bangladesh camp","“The cause of the fire currently remains unknown, and we are assured by the government authorities that an investigation into the cause of the fire will be carried out,” says UNHCR.","DHAKA: A fire swept through a Rohingya refugee camp in southeastern Bangladesh in the early hours of Sunday, destroying about 800 shelters and rendering thousands homeless, officials said.
Fire service officials and Rohingya volunteers brought the blaze under control around three hours after it hit Camp 5 in Cox’s Bazar, a border district with Myanmar, shortly before 1am.
Apart from homes, several other facilities like learning centres were also gutted, Bangladesh’s Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner in Cox’s Bazar, Mohammed Mizanur Rahman said, adding that there were no casualties.
UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, said nearly 7,000 have been made homeless by the blaze and around 120 facilities, including mosques and healthcare centres were damaged.
“We have made all arrangements […] they are being given food and temporary shelters,” said Mohammad Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees.
Nearly a million members of the Muslim minority from Myanmar live in crammed, bamboo-and-plastic camps in Bangladesh’s border district of Cox’s Bazar, most of them having fled a military crackdown in 2017.
“The cause of the fire currently remains unknown, and we are assured by the government authorities that an investigation into the cause of the fire will be carried out,” UNHCR said.
Fires often break out in the crowded camps with its makeshift structures. A massive blaze in March 2021 killed at least 15 refugees and destroyed more than 10,000 homes.

Seoul’s military said that North Korea had  “conducted artillery fire with over 90 rounds north of Yeonpyeong island from 1600 to 1710 (0400 to 0510 GMT) today”.
They accused the North of  “repeated artillery fire” within a buffer zone created in 2018 under a now-defunct tension-reducing deal, saying the bombardment posed  “a threat to the peace on the Korean Peninsula.” 
North Korea’s military said it had carried out  “maritime live-fire training” with 88 rounds of artillery but said the drills were  “directionally unrelated” to the maritime border.
The exercises  “did not pose any intentional threat” to South Korea and were part of the North’s  “normal training system of our military,” it said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
No North Korean artillery shells fell south of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime border in the Yellow Sea, and no casualties were reported, according to the Yonhap news agency.

3,Tripledemic fears spreading fast in US,"Three major respiratory viruses — flu, Covid-19 and RSV — continue to increase in parts of the country","WASHINGTON: The United States is currently grappling with a surge in three major respiratory viruses — flu, Covid-19, and RSV — raising fears of a potential ‘tripledemic’ during its first post-pandemic respiratory season, according to recent reports.
Over the weekend, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a stark warning, citing an increase in coronavirus cases globally, particularly with the emergence of the JN.1 variant, which has become the most prevalent as of December 23.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlighted the dominance of the JN.1 variant, projecting it to represent 39-50 per cent of circulating variants.
While existing vaccines, tests, and treatments are still effective against the JN.1 variant, the CDC underscores the importance of continued monitoring. Globally, the WHO reports a 52pc rise in Covid-19 infections, attributing challenges to reporting accuracy due to decreased surveillance and vaccination efforts worldwide.

Three major respiratory viruses — flu, Covid-19 and RSV — continue to increase in parts of the country

The JN.1 variant, originating in the US and evolving from the Omicron variant, has now spread globally. Complicating matters further, there is a surge in flu cases in the US, with vaccination uptake lagging.
Disturbingly, about eight million fewer people received the flu shot in the US by mid-December compared to the same period in 2022. Additionally, only a fifth of American adults have received the latest Covid-19 shot, and flu vaccine uptake remains low.
Earlier optimism in the autumn, buoyed by the availability of RSV vaccines and updated Covid-19 vaccines, has waned. Accessing the vaccine for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, has proven challenging for many.
Covid-19 hospital admissions have been on the rise since November, and wastewater detection indicates significant increases in virus levels at 69pc of monitored sites. Flu activity across the country is currently deemed ‘elevated and continues to increase in most parts of the country,’ according to the CDC.
Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at UTHealth Houston, has confirmed simultaneous surges in flu and Covid-19 cases. In an interview with The Hill newspaper, which covers Congressional activities, Ostrosky emphasised the need for heightened vigilance.
Global health organisations stress the importance of monitoring, understanding, and combating respiratory viruses. They urge communities to prioritise vaccination and adhere to preventive measures to effectively tackle the triple threat of Covid-19, flu, and RSV.
The situation is evolving rapidly, and health authorities are closely monitoring developments to mitigate the impact of this triple health challenge.

4,Woman pulled from rubble five days after Japan quake,SUZU: A woman in her 90s trapped for five days under rubble caused by a huge earthquake in central Japan was rescued...,"SUZU: A woman in her 90s trapped for five days under rubble caused by a huge earthquake in central Japan was rescued against the odds, but snow and storms were further complicating relief efforts on Sunday.
At least 128 people died in the magnitude-7.5 tremor on New Year’s Day and its aftershocks — a toll that is sure to rise, with 195 others reported missing, according to local authorities.
The shockwaves toppled buildings, sparked a major fire and triggered tsunami waves over a metre high on the Sea of Japan side of the main island of Honshu. The hope of finding survivors usually fades three days after a destructive quake.
But an elderly woman spent five days under the wreckage of a collapsed house in the city of Suzu on the hard-hit Noto Peninsula before being saved on Saturday. She was taken to hospital and was able to hold a conversation, according to public broadcaster NHK.
“Hang in there!” rescuers were heard calling to the woman in police footage from the rainy scene published by local media. “You’re gonna be OK!” they shouted.  “Stay positive!”

5,Erdogan backs former environment chief to win back Istanbul,ISTANBUL: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday entrusted a former environment minister to run for mayor of...,"ISTANBUL: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday entrusted a former environment minister to run for mayor of Istanbul and avenge the worst political defeat of the Turkish leader’s two-decade rule.
Murat Kurum will represent Erdogan’s Islamic conservative Justice and Develop­ment Party (AKP) in March 31 municipal elections in which control of Turkey’s main cities will be up for grabs.
The secular opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) seized back control of Istanbul for the first time since Erdogan ruled the city as mayor in the 1990s in watershed 2019 polls. That vote also saw the opposition win back the capital Ankara and keep power in the Aegean port city of Izmir.
The opposition’s control of Turkey’s three main cities shattered Erdogan’s image of political invincibility and underscored the levels of resentment rising against his dominant rule.
The president’s rivals campaigned against perceived corruption and a sweeping political crackdown that followed a failed 2016 coup attempt. Erdogan bounced back last year to win a tough re-election that came in the throes of an economic crisis in which the annual inflation rate topped 85 per cent.
He has since set his sights on winning back Istanbul — the city where he grew up playing street football and where he launched his political career as a self-proclaimed champion of Turkey’s pious Muslims and the poor.
“We say no stopping until March 31, keep going,” Erdogan told cheering supporters during a party congress in Istanbul. “We stand before our nation with candidates who run for solutions rather than excuses, who act with humility rather than arrogance,” he said.
Kurum graduated from Konya’s Selcuk University with a degree in civil engineering and served as Erdogan’s environment and urbanisation minister from 2018 until last year. Turkish media reported that the 47-year-old Ankara native came out on top of an internal party poll Erdogan oversaw last month.
Kurum also worked in Turkey’s housing development administration and became a member of parliament representing one of Istanbul’s districts last year. His wife Sengul has held a senior position at Turkey’s powerful RTUK media regulator since 2021. Kurum’s background as an urban planner fits with Erdo­gan’s claims that Istanbul has become run down and dysfunctional under opposition control.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Ima­moglu edged out Erdogan’s ally in a 2019 election that gained international headlines for being controversially annulled. Imamoglu won a re-run vote by a massive margin that turned him into an instant hero for the opposition and a formidable foe for Erdogan. The 52-year-old is widely seen as the opposition’s best bet at winning back the presidency from Erdogan’s AKP in 2028.

BEVERLY HILLS: Margot Robbie, Oprah Winfrey and Leonardo DiCaprio will mingle with other top stars at the Golden Globe awards, Hollywood’s first big celebration since twin strikes shut down most of show business last year.
The red carpet, champagne-fueled awards ceremony will honor the best of film and television selec­ted by a new group of 300 entertainment journalists from around the world, part of reforms made after a diversity and ethics scandal among voters.
“Barbie,” the summer blockbuster starring Rob­bie as the iconic doll, leads all nominees with nine nominations. Historical drama  “Oppenheimer,” about the making of the atomic bomb, follows with eight nods.
The Globes kick off Hollywood’s annual awards season, which culminates with the Oscars on March 10, and will bring top stars together after six months of strikes by actors and writers in 2023. The ceremony will give celebrities the chance to shine a spotlight on their films and TV shows after months when promotion was prohibited.
“I’m a little biased, but this is the best awards show and we’re going to have fun,” said comedian Jo Koy, who will host his first major awards show starting at 8pm. The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS and streamed simultaneously for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime.
Acting nominees inclu­de Robbie and  “Barbie” co-star Ryan Gosl­ing, plus  “Oppenheimer” stars Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, who starred in Martin Scorsese’s  “Killers of the Flower Moon,” also are up for trophies. Winfrey is among the night’s presenters.

7,Trump demands release of Capitol attackers,"“They’ve suffered enough [...] I call them hostages. Some people call them prisoners,” says Trump.","CLINTON (Iowa): Donald Trump on Saturday downplayed his role in the siege of the US Capitol on the third anniversary of the attack, arguing that those prosecuted for storming the building should be freed.
Speaking at a campaign event in Clinton, Iowa with the first Republican nominating contest little more than a week away, Trump called those jailed in the wake of the Jan 6, 2021 attack  “hostages” and said they had been mistreated by the Biden administration.
“They’ve suffered enough,” Trump said.  “I call them hostages. Some people call them prisoners.”  Speaking to more than a thousand supporters in a school gymnasium, Trump repeated his unfounded claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent and cast himself as a victim of political persecution. “I got indicted because I challenged the crooked election,” Trump told the crowd.
Trump faces a bevy of state and federal charges for his attempts to subvert the election, but has not been charged with instigating the 2021 insurrection, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol as legislators were certifying President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory.
Biden has repeatedly called Trump a threat to democracy on the campaign trail, and that messaging has emerged as an central theme of his campaign so far. Vice President Kamala Harris spoke of the Jan 6 assault at length during an event in South Carolina on Saturday.
At recent campaign events in Iowa, Trump’s supporters — and even supporters of other Republican presidential hopefuls — have downplayed the significance of Jan 6, and many have embraced conspiracy theories regarding the events of that day.

8,Two more journalists killed in Israeli aggression in Gaza,"Al Jazeera strongly condemns killings, says it was a ‘deliberate attack","TWO more Palestinian journalists lost their lives in Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, bringing the number of journalists killed in the violence since Oct. 7 to 109.
According to an official statement, the victims were identified as Hamza Wael Al-Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh, and Mustafa Thuraya. Hamza was a correspondent for Al Jazeera, while Mustafa was working with AFP. Both lost their lives in an Israeli airstrike targeting their car in the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. 
The two journalists were on their way to Al Mawasi, a safer area towards the southwest where their vehicle was hit by the missile, as reported by Al Jazeera. A third journalist travelling with them, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured.
Hamza was 27 years old, while Mustafa was in his thirties.

Al Jazeera strongly condemns killings, says it was a ‘deliberate attack

Mustafa had worked with AFP since 2019 and had also worked with other international media outlets.
The  two of them had been tasked with filming the aftermath of a strike on a  house in Rafah and their car was hit while they were on their way back,  AFP correspondents said.
“Hamza was everything for me ... while we are full of humanity they (Israel) are full of murder and hatred,” Wael said on Al Jazeera television.
Footage showed him in tears as he hugged his son’s body at a hospital, surrounded by other journalists and relatives.
“The world should see with two eyes, not with an Israeli eye. They should see everything happening to the Palestinian people,” he added..
“What did Hamza do to them (Israelis)? What did my family do to them? What did the civilians do to them? They did nothing to them, but the world closes its eyes to what’s happening in the Gaza Strip.”“We are in shock,” Christophe Deloire of the media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders wrote Sunday on X, formerly Twitter, calling the situation a “never-ending slaughter”.
Perpetual losses
In a press release, the Palestinian government’s media office  strongly condemned the “heinous crime” perpetrated by the “Israeli occupation army against journalists.”“Israel aims to intimidate journalists in a failed attempt to obscure the truth and prevent media coverage,” the press release said as reported by Andalou Agency.
Al-Jazeera Media Network condemned the killing of the two journalists and said it had been a deliberate attack.
“We urge the International Criminal Court, the governments and human rights organisations, and the United Nations (UN) to hold Israel accountable for its heinous crimes and demand an end to the targeting and killing of journalists,” the network said in a statement.
Previously, Wael lost his wife, his son who was younger than Hamza, daughter and grandson to Israeli aggression at the end of October. He was in the middle of live reporting where he got the call from the hospital. 
Then in mid-December, he was badly injured in an attack which also killed his workmate Samer Abudaqa.
The number of journalists who have either lost family members or passed away themselves continues to increase.
In December, Anas al-Sharif lost his father in an Israeli air raid that targeted his family’s residence in Jabalia.
Just a few days earlier, on December 6, Moamen Al Sharafi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera Arabic, witnessed the tragic death of 22 members of his family when an Israeli attack struck the house where they were taking shelter in the Jabalia refugee camp.
In late October, broadcast engineer Mohamed Abu Al-Qumsan faced the devastating loss of 19 family members, including his father and two sisters, during Israeli air raids on the same refugee camp. Earlier, Issam Abdullah, a journalist for Reuters was killed by an Israeli tank on October 13.

Israel’s army said it had  “completed the dismantling of the Hamas military framework in the northern Gaza Strip” and its forces would now focus on central and southern areas of the territory.
The prospect of a wider regional war loomed with army spokesman Daniel Hagari warning that Hezbollah was  “dragging Lebanon into an unnecessary war”. The group fired more than 60 rockets at an Israeli military base on Saturday in response to this week’s killing in Beirut of Hamas’s deputy leader.Netanyahu was under growing pressure on Saturday with demonstrators gathering in Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to call for early elections and the resignation of his government.
“Bibi Netanyahu and all the rest of his idiots are ruining Israel and they are destroying everything we hoped and dreamed of,” Shachaf Netzer, 54, said. “Everybody here wants an election.” 
‘Uninhabitable’
Civilians in Gaza Strip have borne the brunt of the unrest as the scale of the destruction has triggered mass displacement and a deepening humanitarian crisis.
With swathes of the territory reduced to rubble, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said  “Gaza has simply become uninhabitable”.
The World Health Organisation says most of Gaza’s 36 hospitals have been put out of action by the fighting, while remaining medical facilities face dire shortages.
International aid group Doctors Without Borders said it had evacuated its staff from Al Aqsa hospital in central Gaza after a bullet penetrated a wall in the intensive care unit.
“The situation became so dangerous that some staff living in the neighbouring areas were not able to leave their houses because of the constant threats of drones and snipers,” said Carolina Lopez, the group’s emergency coordinator at the hospital.

WASHINGTON: An American intelligence assessment found that it would be difficult for Israel to succeed in a war against Hezbollah amid ongoing fighting in Gaza, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.
US President Joe Biden has dispatched his top aides to the Middle East with “a critical objective: Prevent a full-blown war from erupting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hez­bollah,” the US newspaper said.
Israel, however, has warned that it may soon launch a major military operation in Lebanon to stop regular border clashes.
“We prefer the path of an agreed-upon diplomatic settlement,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday, “but we are getting close to the point where the hourglass will turn over.”
According to the Post, US officials fear that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may expand the war to Lebanon to silence his critics and to secure his political future.
“In private conversations, the administration has warned Israel against a significant escalation in Lebanon,” the report added. If it were to do so, a new secret assessment from the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) “found that it will be difficult for Israel’s army to succeed because its military assets and resources would be spread too thin given the conflict in Gaza,” the Post reported.
The report pointed out that Hezbollah has well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of missiles and rockets and it would be a formidable force to deal with. The newspaper also noted that Hezbollah wants to avoid a major escalation and the group’s leader, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, wants to stay clear of a wider war.”
The DIA has warned that Israel’s military, including air forces, may face challenges in Lebanon due to fatigue, resource strain, and more dangerous missions compared to Gaza. 
The Biden administration has conveyed this warning to Israel, the report added US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is already in the region to discuss specific steps to avoid escalation during his visit to Israel. Efforts include working on an agreement to reduce tensions at the Lebanese-Israeli border and exploring a proposal for the Lebanese government to control part of the border.
Israel’s deep fears about the threat from Hezbollah influenced Biden’s decision to intervene, and as did its concerns about how Netanyahu might react to the situation.
The Post noted that there were differing perceptions within the US administration about Netanyahu’s interest in a negotiated resolution with Hezbollah. Some see it as bluster, while others suggest political motivations tied to the Gaza unrest.
Diplomatic efforts include exploring a land demarcation agreement and discussions with the Lebanese government, though Hezbollah is unlikely to agree while the Gaza conflict persists.
While reviewing Netanyahu’s political logic, some Biden administration officials noted that his “need for success” after the failure to detect the Oct 7 raid might lead to a broader conflict in the region.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, were on separate trips to the region to try to quell spillover from the unrest into Lebanon, the West Bank and Red Sea shipping routes, where Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis have vowed to keep up attacks until Israel halts its campaign in the Palestinian enclave.
Despite global concern over the death and destruction in Gaza and widespread calls for a ceasefire, Israeli public opinion remains firmly behind the operation, although support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen sharply.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Saturday  visited Beirut, where he met a senior figure in Hezbollah’s political  wing as part of efforts to avoid Lebanon being drawn into the war, an EU  source confirmed.
Borrell also held talks with the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammad Raad, Lebanese media reported.
“It  is imperative to avoid regional escalation in the Middle East. It is  absolutely necessary to avoid Lebanon being dragged into a regional  conflict,” Borrell told a news conference in Beirut.
Borrell said he would go to Saudi Arabia next to discuss  “a joint EU-Arab initiative” for peace.
The  Hamas-allied Hezbollah movement has been trading near-daily fire with  Israeli forces since early October, and fired dozens of rockets at an  Israeli military base in response to the killing of a senior Hamas  figure in a suspected Israeli strike in Beirut on Tuesday.
Hezbollah  said it had targeted the Israeli military’s Meron air control base with  62 missiles in its  “initial response” to the killing of Saleh  al-Aruri, Hamas’s deputy leader, in Beirut.
The Israeli army  reported  “approximately 40 launches from Lebanon” and said it struck  Hezbollah  “military sites” in response.

12,Beirut airport screens hacked by Hezbollah critics,"BEIRUT: Beirut airport on Sunday came under a cyberattack, Lebanon’s state news agency said, with footage shared ...","BEIRUT: Beirut airport on Sunday came under a cyberattack, Lebanon’s state news agency said, with footage shared by local media showing anti-Hezbollah messages had replaced screen displays at its terminal.
Hezbollah has exchanged near-daily cross-border fire with its arch foe Israel since October 7, with the Lebanese movement saying it was acting in support of its Palestinian ally in Gaza.
Media reports said the airport message urged the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah not to  “drag the country into war”.
Lebanon’s National News Agency said  “the cyberattack on the departure and arrival screens at the airport disrupted the BHS baggage inspection system.” It added that authorities were working to restore the screens  “and to maintain normal movement at the airport”.
Local media circulated images of the message criticising Hezbollah, displayed onscreen alongside the emblem of the Christian  “Soldiers of God” group. The group has declined to comment when contacted. It later released a video statement appearing to deny involvement in the cyberattack, describing it as  “the work of the devil”.
The message said the airport was  “not the airport of Hezbollah and Iran”, according to the reports.
“Hassan Nasrallah, no one will support you if you drag the country into war,” it added, addressing the group’s leader, also saying  “we will not fight on behalf of anyone.” The killing on Tuesday of Hamas’s deputy leader in Hezbollah’s southern Beirut stronghold, which a US defence official said was carried out by Israel, has raised fears of escalation.
“You’re going to blow up our airport by bringing in weapons. Let the airport be freed from the grip of the (Hezbollah) statelet,” the airport message said.
On Saturday, Hezbollah said it fired more than 60 rockets at an Israeli military base in response to the strike that killed Hamas’s number two, Saleh al-Aruri.
Hezbollah is the only Lebanese group to have held on to its weapons arsenal after the end of the country’s 1975-1990 civil war.
