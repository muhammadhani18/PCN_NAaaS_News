0,Shadowy funds in a fragile democracy,It is extremely challenging to precisely identify the various and diverse sources of election funding unless someone on the inside reports it.,"Illicit wealth amassed by individuals involved in black market activities can resurface and be legitimised during the election cycle in Pakistan. 
This is likely to obscure the political landscape and cast doubt on the credibility and fairness of the fragile democratic process. 
The Election Commission’s political finance cell may find limited legal avenues to block this influx, posing challenges to maintaining the integrity of the electoral system.
What is even more disconcerting is the lack of attention given to a subject that essentially shapes the integrity of the democratic project in Pakistan. There seems to be a notable absence of systematic research or studies on the economics of elections in the country. Journalistic endeavours on the matter only skim the surface, relying on hearsay and guesswork due to the absence of pertinent data. 
Certain fragmented pieces of evidence support the notion of wealth entering the system from undisclosed origins. With the lack of oversight on funds transfers for financing election campaigns by the State Bank, Election Commission (ECP), or any other official body or civil society platform, those keen on understanding the economics of elections have had to resort to informal surveys and brief interviews with relevant stakeholders to glean some insight into the reality.

‘It is extremely challenging to precisely identify the various and diverse sources of election funding unless someone on the inside reports it’

The investigative groundwork for this report has revealed that repositories of savings in the country, including banks, saving schemes, private fund management companies, real estate, etc, maintained a relative calm all through election phases that recur at five-year intervals since 2008. 
While election campaigns involve requisitioning services from printers, painters, advertisers, caterers, decorators, transporters, private jet operators, social media warriors, channel operators, commodity dealers, paid workers, etc, a substantial amount of money changes hands, contributing to an upswing in economic activity.
Attempts to solicit input from the hierarchy of the State Bank proved unsuccessful. Privately, some bankers, speaking anonymously, confirmed that after the election date announcement and the finalisation of nomination papers by the ECP, no significant fluctuations in the withdrawal levels have been observed now or in previous elections. 
Hamid Raza Khalid, Director General of the Central Directorate of National Savings, echoed sentiments similar to those of bankers. Speaking over the phone from Islamabad, he stated: “We have not observed increased withdrawals linked to elections.” 
Realtors and fund operators contacted were somewhat evasive, but feedback from several individuals active in those sectors indicated sluggish business and a lack of urgency among sellers looking to liquidate their investments.
In response to an inquiry on this matter, Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, CEO of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), expressed keen interest in the subject and recognised its relevance. He lamented the scarcity of research on the topic and underscored the imperative for enhancement in the laws governing the financial aspects of elections. 
Rashid Chaudhry, National Coordinator, Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), remarked, “Given the absence of a mechanism to trace and track the money trail of private election expenditures, estimated to be in billions of rupees, the likelihood of funds flowing from unknown sources remain strong.”

It is the electorate’s right to know who is funding whom and for what purpose

While the Election Act establishes spending limits for candidates aspiring to secure seats in the federal or provincial tiers of the legislature, it inadvertently creates loopholes in the legal framework, allowing them to surpass these limits without any adverse consequences. 
According to the election law, all participants are mandated to open a dedicated election account for routing campaign financing at the time of filing nomination papers. There is, however, no requirement to disclose the sources of funds deposited into this dedicated account. 
A candidate running for a seat in the National Assembly can legally expend up to Rs10 million, while candidates for provincial assemblies have a limit of Rs4m. However, the law absolves contestants from the obligation to account for all expenditures made on their behalf by others.
Even in the optimistic scenario where all 336 National Assembly seat contestants adhere to the spending limits, considering just three candidates per constituency, a straightforward calculation, multiplying Rs10m by 1,008 candidates (three times 336), yields a staggering figure exceeding Rs10bn. Presently, there are a total of 22,751 candidates vying for positions in national or provincial assemblies.
With the looming deadlines before the polls, it seems the Election Commission has been preoccupied, perhaps not finding time to address the need for closing regulatory loopholes to enhance financial transparency. Despite reaching out to the political finance wing of the ECP for their insights, their response was not received at the time of filing this report.
Zubair Faisal Abbasi, a development policy expert based in Islamabad, was candid in sharing his perspective, drawing from his recent involvement in the interaction of the ECP with civic bodies.
In response to a query on this matter, he stated, “Under the current legal arrangements, it is extremely challenging to precisely identify the various and diverse sources of funding unless someone on the inside starts reporting on it. This became evident in the case of a particular political party in Pakistan, where irregularities were reportedly committed.
“The political finance cell of the ECP collects financial records from all contestants. The challenge lies in the fact that not everyone complies with reporting, and perhaps not every response undergoes thorough scrutiny by the ECP. The legal mechanisms to enforce the rules and follow-up actions have, so far, been largely ineffective. 
“It appears there is a need for ‘sunshine rules’ to ensure transparency in the transfer of funds for electioneering. The declared amount of spending by candidates often falls short of the extravagance witnessed in society during the election period. It is the electorate’s right to know who is funding whom and for what purpose.”

1,China’s growth spurs hope,"Beijing’s economic recovery is good news for Pakistan, given the country’s heavy reliance on its heavyweight neighbour.","China seems to have successfully spurred a ‘modest’ post-pandemic economic recovery amid a myriad of problems, ranging from slump in the real estate sector, stagnant domestic demand, mounting local government debt, deflation, oversupply in some sectors (due to lower exports), soaring youth unemployment and dwindling foreign investment.
That China has defied predictions of economic gloom is good news for the global economy as well as countries like Pakistan that are heavily reliant on Beijing for investments, trade and budgetary support.
Beijing’s economic performance after it lifted the Covid Zero restrictions early last year also impressed the International Monetary Fund to revise China’s GDP growth projection from an earlier five per cent to 5.4pc for 2023, and 4.6pc for 2024, which also represents an increase from its previous estimates. 
American investment bank, J.P. Morgan, has described 2023 as a roller-coaster of a year for China. “From a growth perspective, the economy looks set to deliver around 5pc real GDP growth, which is respectable, but slower than the pre-Covid period,” it had noted in a note last month.

Beijing’s economic recovery is good news for Pakistan, given the country’s heavy reliance on its heavyweight neighbour

In December, China’s Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), considered an economic policy bellwether and the most important policy-making event, set out priorities for 2024, including science and technology innovation, stronger demand, stability, rural development and integration, and low carbon and ecological investment. It concluded that “China’s economy has achieved a recovery, with solid progress made in high-quality development in 2023.”
At the same time, it also conceded that “impediments to recovery remain”, citing inadequate demand, overcapacity in several sectors, weak social expectations and numerous risks and hidden dangers, which need to be overcome to further revive the economy. But it stressed that “favourable conditions outweighing unfavourable factors in China’s developmental landscape, and the fundamental trend of the economic recovery and long-term positive outlook has not changed”.
According to China’s state media, the conference has hinted at ramping up policy adjustments to support an economic recovery during this year. “It is necessary to strengthen counter-cyclical and cross-cyclical (meaning taking action sooner, in smaller steps and with a longer time frame in mind) adjustments of macro policies,” the CEWC said, calling for a balanced pursuit of progress and stability, and advocating for the consolidation of stability through continuous progress.
This means China will “continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy and strengthen innovation and coordination of policy tools” as Beijing prioritises high-quality development. In other words, Beijing will boost spending and create liquidity in the banking sector to push domestic demand.
It changed its fiscal stance in the third quarter of last year by accelerating spending, helping local governments with their debt problems and announcing stimulus packages for infrastructure investment and housing construction. It has also broken the long-standing 3pc of GDP “glass ceiling” on budgetary deficits. 
Analysts expect the fiscal stance to be 1.5-2pc of GDP more expansionary this year, assuming Beijing will set a 3.8pc GDP fiscal deficit target and fully implement the CN¥1 trillion or $140.7 billion infrastructure stimulus to spur stagnant demand.
The CEWC’s priorities focus on scientific and technological innovation to advance a modern industrial system, countering assertions of economic slowdown. Key areas of focus include boosting domestic demand, deepening fiscal and tax reforms, high-level opening in industries such as healthcare and services, and ensuring stability in the financial sector, particularly in the property market.
The CEWC, according to the state media, is not oblivious to the impending challenges that might impair the 2024 goals. Being aware of the situation, it stressed continuing to build a market-oriented, legal and international business environment. 
It emphasised the need for more openness to effectively address the obstacles for foreigners to come to China for business, study, and tourism and do a good job in implementing the eight steps to support high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.
When China sneezes
When China sneezes, it is said, Asia catches a cold. Several Southeast Asian economies are already facing pressure as foreign suppliers that grew fat supplying raw materials and machinery to Beijing are confronting lean times on the back of weaker-than-the-expected economic growth in China. 
There is no guarantee that this pain will not spill over to other countries and regions if China’s recovery is hampered in the near- to medium-term. The delay in the full recovery of China’s economy is a problem not just for China but also for the entire world.
Even though Pakistan has a negligibly small share in the Chinese supply chains, the Uni­ted Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 2020 included it in the list of 20 economies across the world that were affected the most after the world’s second-largest economy suffered slowdown because of novel coronavirus.
Pakistan’s former ambassador and permanent representative to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Manzoor Ahmed, says, “China imports about $3bn worth of goods for Pakistan while Pakistan’s imports from China are about $23bn. We are not among China’s top 30 export destinations, while China is our second biggest importer.
“Our exports are mostly raw materials such as metals (copper, zinc), about $1bn, textiles (mostly cotton yarn), about $1bnb and agricultural products, including rice. Our exports are low but growing at over 10pc. Any slowdown in China will have some impact on our exports, but not too much. Imports are not likely to be impacted.”
However, he notes that China’s economic slowdown drives down global demand for oil and other commodities, which results in a lowering of their prices. “While Pakistan benefits from lower international oil prices being a net energy importer, it loses export revenues on its commodity exports like rice and yarn.” 
Although Beijing has continuously supported Pakistan in its difficult times, he thinks if the Chinese economy doesn’t rebound quickly to pre-Covid levels, the Chinese investments related to the Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative will likely not pick up.
Haroon Sharif, who was a state minister for investment promotion in the Imran Khan government, argues that Pakistan heavily relies on Beijing for budgetary support, infrastructure investments and trade. “Now is the time to encourage business-to-business joint ventures to create jobs and boost exports, both to China and the rest of the world. 
“The Chinese companies are looking for joint ventures with credible businesses here to set up factories in different industrial sectors. At least 200 Chinese companies are already operating here and doing very well. But those are focused only on the domestic Pakistani market. We need to encourage business-to-business cooperation in export industries.”

2,Karachi’s tax dilemma,The imposition of municipal utility charges is likely to divide the city into ‘have’ and ‘have not’ divisions,"Our municipal institutions are revenue-starved. Be it the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), towns or the union committees, the problem is the same. 
To consolidate finances, the KMC has been pursuing the imposition of municipal utility charges and taxes (MUCT) for some time now. The decision to collect Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) in Karachi is yet to take any concrete shape. 
Several weeks ago, the mayor succeeded in passing a resolution through the City Council to move ahead with his idea of engaging Karachi Electric (KE) to collect this levy. The matter has landed in the Sindh High Court. A strong opposition has been voiced by different quarters, especially the opposition ranks in the City Council.
Conversations with ordinary people inform that the current economic recession and the depressing situation do not make it an opportune time to impose any new levy. The citizens are already grappling with the issues of power shutdowns and poor levels of service in water, sewerage and drainage. 
Overall inflation that stayed around 40 per cent during 2023 has crippled the life of the ordinary in the metropolis and beyond. It is argued that burdening ordinary folks with another financial charge is grossly unjustified. 

The imposition of municipal utility charges is likely to divide the city into ‘have’ and ‘have not’ divisions

People also decry the poor performance of the KMC on many counts. For instance, no intervention has been done to undertake the most vital maintenance works that the metropolis requires. Roads, streets, lanes, water mains, drainage channels, sewerage lines, solid waste management spaces, footpaths, pedestrian bridges, natural water drains (nullahs), traffic signals, green belts, bridges and other components of essential civic infrastructure has completely or partially broken down. While some tasks fall under the control of other civic agencies, KMC is supposed to lead being the premier elected municipal forum of the metropolis.
Our people are often confused between taxation and utility charges. Taxation is a levy imposed by an administration on citizens, institutions or both concerning the fulfilment of certain conditions. Property tax is charged from the owners of immovable property, and motor vehicle tax is collected from users of vehicles in stipulated categories. Each category clearly defines the inclusion and exclusion of user groups according to their respective characteristics. 
The important point is that the KMC has taxed a set of public goods which must be freely accessible to all without hindrance. The improved environment is a long-denied right of the people. This argument derives from the fact that this city contributes the highest proportion of direct and indirect taxes to the national exchequer. Thus, a better living environment and the corresponding infrastructure become a matter of right, not a charged privilege.
Our provincial and local administration complain about a lack of financial resources. After the passage of the 18th constitutional amendment in 2010, the provincial share in the National Finance Commission award has significantly increased. 
Billions of rupees are transferred to the provincial coffers every year. Sindh also receives a special allocation on account of the abolition of the Octroi and Zila tax. As Karachi accounts for more than one-third of the province’s population, one assumes that a proportional amount would be allocated for shoring up the urban infrastructure and related needs. But nothing of the sort has been done. 
Disappointingly, the provincial finance commission, a body responsible for allocating and distributing funds to the districts in the province, remained largely dysfunctional.
Karachi is also the prime location for real estate development, generating billions in value addition. However, the city only collects a paltry Rs2 billion or thereabout in this most crucial tax form. 
Property tax is one of the foremost taxes imposed upon urban and sub-urban properties on those owners who are the direct beneficiaries of capital investments and general price escalation of their properties due to multiple factors. Similarly, Rs8.5bn was collected through motor vehicle tax, despite the city reporting registration of over 900 cars/other four-wheelers and over 1,000 motorcycles every day.
Many more challenges will emerge if the KMC receives a go-ahead for collecting MUCT. It is observed that the MUCT is likely to divide the city into ‘have’ and ‘have not’ divisions. The upper- and middle-income localities, commercial areas and posh localities shall be the focus of this levy and perhaps consequent spending. 
Unregularised areas, expanding low-income neighbourhoods and peri-urban areas will eventually be left to their own low fates. Pressure from taxpayers will not allow public infrastructure spending to address less privileged locations. High visibility but low relevance projects shall keep evolving around the old contexts. It is already a well-known fact that roads and highways have marginally benefited low-income localities. 
Additionally, the conflict of jurisdiction is also an issue which needs to be streamlined. The residents of such neighbourhoods which do not fall under the control of KMC shall continue to get services through varied formats, while the residents in the municipal limits will be burdened with the payments of levies. 
The coverage of new levies must consider the nature and scale of users. For instance, road user charges must be revisited, and probably made commensurate with the road development schemes that have been recently built. Benefits to motorists should not be charged to pedestrians or property owners. 
It may be noticed that the lion’s share of investment has gone into roads, expressways, flyovers, interchanges and by-passes. In the majority of cases, road widening schemes have deprived pedestrians of the basic right of proper sidewalks. Pedestrian crossings are too few. High velocities of traffic have rendered crossing of streets as prohibitively dangerous. 
The status of solid waste management in the city is utterly dismal. Whereas contractual complications did not allow the involvement of a foreign firm in this service, the existing performance of KMC on this count is far below the desirable standard. 
Our municipal agencies complain about a low revenue base. This fact merits a review of the recovery of existing levies. The city has enormous potential for revenue generation with respect to property taxes. Under-statement of property values and poor collection practices are only two of the various ailments in this sector. 
The water supply in the city is almost free for those who get it from the pipes or those who obtain it through informal means. Though the collection of water charges has improved, it is still below 60pc of the number of consumers. In total contrast, a vast number of consumers obtain it through super expensive water tankers. 
No monitoring is done to impose and effectively collect motor vehicle tax from the motor cars and motor bikes which now exist in millions. They are a genuine source of revenue pertinent to motor vehicle tax. Non-utilisation fees on vacant plots are another head that can be explored to its logical end. 
Lessons can be drawn from other cities in South Asia. For example, Dhaka generates about 70pc of revenue from own sources. The remaining is obtained from intergovernmental grants and other options. 
The KMC must revisit the concept and application of municipal charges. The proposal of new taxation must emanate from the premise of beneficiaries and affectees. Those who benefit must share the cost of investment. 
Adequate allocation must be ensured for less developed locations in terms of basic infrastructure. An equalisation fund can be created to establish the mechanism of public spending in less privileged localities. 
These types of funds draw a certain percentage of taxes collected from affluent localities to develop less developed contexts. In addition to the exposed components of infrastructure, emphasis must also be given to revitalising underground drains, conduits and pipelines. 
The tariff and schedule of charges need to be fixed after a scientific review of the ground realities. Participation of stakeholders can add substantial value to the whole exercise.

3,Finance: Time to tread cautiously,A modest rate cut just to signal to the markets that the days of a tight monetary policy are gone won’t help revive industrial pro,"Despite higher energy and interest rate costs and even amidst stagnant industrial output, Pakistan’s merchandise exports are growing — thanks to strong overseas demand, reduced bureaucratic impediments to export growth and a shift in export earnings from textiles to agricultural products and food.
On the other hand, merchandise imports continue to fall despite the recent decline in the US dollar value against the rupee — thanks to effective bureaucratic and banking controls on foreign purchases and a visible fall in domestic demand as the economy refuses to grow fast enough to bolster demand.
The merchandise trade deficit is falling, contracting the current account balance deficit and easing pressure on dollar demand. It is a small wonder, then, that the rupee keeps making modest gains in value day after day.
But will this trend, witnessed in the first half of FY24 (July-Dec 2023 but more so in Oct-Dec), continue through the second half of the year (Jan-Dec 2024)? That’s a million-dollar question.

A modest rate cut just to signal to the markets that the days of a tight monetary policy are gone won’t help revive industrial production

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has insisted that Pakistan lifts all formal and informal controls on imports. The Funds demand will likely become louder after the expected 11th January approval of the second tranche of a $3bn loan. 
After the general elections on February 8, the newly elected government will find it too challenging to continue import controls. It will be anxiously counting on the third and final tranche of the IMF loan, expected sometime in March-April, before seeking a larger long-term loan to address structural issues behind the balance of payment problems. 
The caretaker government may have to swallow the first bitter pill (of freeing up imports) before the elections if the Fund’s demand becomes “urgent”. That depends on the IMF. 
Volumetric growth in goods’ exports in July-Dec 2023 ($737m) is too little compared with the savings in import payments ($5.08bn) during the same period. This means the shrinkage in the merchandise trade deficit ($11.148bn in July-Dec 2023 from $16.965bn in July-Dec 2022) is qualitatively poor and undoubtedly unsustainable even in the short run. 
Containing the trade deficit further more sustainably means the elected government will have to achieve a much faster rate of growth after easing import controls. Will it be possible amidst vanishing space for adequately subsidising energy or interest rates for exporters? Your guess is as good as mine. 
Energy prices are not only set to remain at their current highs in coming months, but further upward revisions look inevitable as IMF-World Bank dictated energy reforms continue and the energy sector’s circular debt stocks remain still too large (Rs2.6trillion at the end of December 2023). 

The great game of geopolitics requires the country to develop a cohesive national policy not only on the economy but also on national security 

The days of reckless interest rate subsidies are already over, and the practice cannot be resumed, as the IMF doesn’t want it to happen. Some hope for the the general easing of interest rates from March onwards. 
However, headline inflation in December was at 29.7pc. Given the possibility of the inflation rate remaining close to or even above 25pc in January and February, there is not enough space for the central bank to consider a substantial cut in its current policy rate of 22pc. And a modest rate cut just to signal to the markets that the days of a tight monetary policy are gone won’t help revive industrial production and commercial practices.
Pre-election political nervousness, worsening law and order situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federal Board of Revenue’s plan to tax retail businesses at all costs and no respite seen in the operational costs of industrial and commercial activity amidst elevated levels of inflation are already having a disastrous impact on small domestic businesses. 
The corporate sector’s confidence has risen recently, though — thanks to some policy interventions of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the civil-army-run investment facilitation council, and timely external debt servicing despite forex shortages and a surge in gross tax revenue collection. In July-Dec 2023, the FBR collected Rs4.467 trillion in tax revenue, surpassing the target of Rs4.425tr.
However, two things are worth watching in the coming months: (1) Pakistan’s ability to line up foreign funds from friendly countries to fill in external financing gaps as well as its ability to attract foreign investment through SIFC and (2) growth in tax revenue after the February 8 general elections.
The army’s role in SIFC and through it in almost all key economic decision-making, plus the role it has acquired for steering the promised Green Revolution, may help revive the economy in the short run, that is, if the newly elected civilian government remains committed to the SIFC model of power sharing. 
But will an elected government work with the same zeal under a new emerging order of SIFC-brand of political economy as the caretakers are working? Well, that depends on who comes into power, with whose blessings, and equipped with what kind of political vision. 
The great game of geopolitics with such cruel manifestations like the spreading Israel-Hamas war, the recent deadly terrorist bombings in Iran, and the fragility of Pakistan’s external sector economy require the country to develop a cohesive national policy not only on the economy but also in other areas of collective life — national security included.
The unending tug-of-war between the political class and the establishment at this stage is obviously undesirable. Both sides must realise this. That said, the establishment must cease from the temptation of ushering in a political party of its choice. 
It must be ready to work with whoever comes to power to develop a long-term economic roadmap under the unquestionable supervision of the people’s parliament and the country’s Constitution.

4,The saga around KB Feeder’s lining,"The Kalri Baghar project’s bidding was tainted by irregularities, leading to an international competitive bidding process.","The lining project of Kalri Baghar (KB) Feeder Upper is now set for international competitive bidding (ICB) after the cancellation of national competitive bidding (NCB) by the Sindh government in the wake of irregularities in a process that irked the Sindh caretaker government. It has also decided to appoint an independent project director (PD) through a competitive process.  
KB Feeder’s lining is part of the larger Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, commonly known as K-IV. The project K-IV would ensure a dependable and sustainable supply of 650 million gallons per day (MGD) to Karachi from Keenjhar Lake. 
K-IV has two phases, and Wapda is currently building Phase-I of K-IV to be completed by October this year and ensure 260 MGD to Karachi from Keenjhar in the first phase. The completion schedule is extended from March 2024 to Oct 2024 as per reports of the recent visit of the Wapda chairman. 
The lining project of the 38-mile-long KB Feeder is a vital component of K-IV, for this would primarily ensure much-needed water supply for Karachi after having been approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Eenec) at the cost of close to Rs40 billion on a 50:50 basis by federal and Sindh governments in Jamshoro and Thatta districts. 

The Kalri Baghar project’s bidding was tainted by irregularities, leading to an international competitive bidding process

NCB was allowed by the secretary of irrigation on Oct 16, 2023, with certain conditions after the request of Kotri Barrage Chief Engineer Haji Khan Jamali, who was the project director. The process, however, was marred by irregularities. 
Sindh Law Minister Umer Soomro, being chairman of Sindh Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (SPPRA) by virtue of his post, smelt a rat in the bidding process and brought it to the notice of Secretary Irrigation Dr Niaz Abbasi on Dec 20, prompting the latter to ask Mr Jamali to stop bidding. However, it was not stopped, and bid evaluation was uploaded by the PD while deviating from the procedure.  
Secretary Irrigation had to recommend that Chief Secretary Sindh issue a show-cause notice to PD in the last week of December. Embarrassingly, the notice was issued on Dec 26, 24 hours before the chief engineer was to retire from service on Dec 27, 2023.  
Mr Soomro informed the secretary that the PD had not been appointed through a competitive process as per the order passed by Sindh High Court Sukkur Bench on May 11, 2023. He observed that the project was of paramount importance while the PD was set to retire on Dec 27. Furthermore, the notice inviting tender of works was split into nine groups ‘deliberately’ to circumvent ICB.  
According to the law minister, the bidding procedure’s most vital aspect was that the irrigation department procuring agency never disclosed the price or quotation. But the price of each tender of lining was given in NCB, which in itself was a blunder and against the transparency of the procedure.   
The project was divided into nine packages by PD, which the secretary said violated SPPRA Rules, which bar splitting of works unless mentioned in project cost-I. 
The prequalification of contractors, a prerequisite for public sector projects, was not done under regulatory guidelines. The prequalification ensures that the company has the credentials, expertise and potential, both financially and technically, to execute the project.  
“Cost is never mentioned in the tender for a project when bids are called. But in the lining, the project cost was disclosed, which means that contractor(s) can easily play on it,” said a senior irrigation officer. “Once a package is divided into groups, ensuring timely completion and getting along with different contractors becomes impossible. We can hardly allow bifurcation of the project after complying with rules,” he commented. 
The outgoing chief engineer’s insistence was that revoking permission for NCB by the irrigation secretary would delay the project as it was approved after long efforts. He wrote to the secretary on Dec 22 that he had withdrawn permission on Dec 21 sans any reason, which would lead to court litigation and loss of exchequer. The secretary didn’t agree and sent a detailed reply to the retired chief engineer. 
“Nowhere in the world is technical and financial evaluation of a project like KB feeder worth Rs40bn can be done in just six days. This was done in the lining project, which is just mindboggling. That’s why the law minister and I put their foot down to reverse the process and start it afresh,” Dr Niaz Abbasi told this writer.  
Sindh regularly presses the federal government for assured water supplies of 2,400 cusecs for the provincial capital from the federal government — out of the national pool — as agreed by the latter when the Water Accord 1991 was finalised. 
Sindh currently provides 1,200 cusecs of water through KB Feeder for the metropolis, which is 680 cusecs over and above the 520 cusecs as the provincial share of Sindh for its metropolitan city as agreed in the Accord. This issue is now pending with Council of Common Interests (CCI) after Sindh sent a representation. 
Indus River System Authority (Irsa) spokesman Khalid Idris Rana said provincial supplies are mentioned under para-2 of Water Accord 1991, thus Sindh should provide water out of its share for Karachi. However, former Sindh irrigation secretary Zarif Iqbal Khero contested Irsa’s viewpoint, saying it misrepresented facts.
Sindh believes Irsa doesn’t distribute water among provinces as per para-2 and has rather invoked a controversial “three-tier” formula, which places the province at a great disadvantage regarding water distribution. 
The then irrigation secretary Babar Effendi had proposed that till the issue is settled, the provision of additional water supply for Karachi can be met by lining Kotri Barrage’s three canals, for which National Engineering Services of Pakistan did a study of the lining of KB feeder. 
A committee has been notified under the chairmanship of the Sindh government’s Planning & Development Board chairman to finalise the appointment of a PD for lining the project through a competitive process. Request for proposals are to be published in newspapers, and then the ICB will take place after 45 days of its publication.

9,The ongoing digital payment spurt,"Online transactions through banks, microfinance banks, and EMIs clocked in at 561m for Q1-FY24 as against 141.3m done over the counter.","Ever since the pandemic gripped the world and disrupted everything, Pakistan’s payments industry has seen a rapid shift towards digitisation, led by exponential growth in mobile banking.
In fact, 80 per cent of all banking transactions (excluding branchless banking) are digital already, while only 20pc remain over-the-counter and continue to become a smaller part of the pie. On top of it, the new electronic money institutions (EMI) have now reached a meaningful scale, doing over Rs200 billion in the last fiscal year.
Since then, that growth has continued, as the State Bank’s (SBP) latest Payment Systems Review for Q1-FY24 shows. Overall, the e-banking transactions through banks, microfinance banks and EMIs clocked in at 561 million, as against 141.3m done over the counter.
This doesn’t include branchless, where the quantum is far bigger, with volumes of 878.9m in the first quarter. However, in terms of value, the dominance of paper was visible with a throughput of Rs17 trillion, up from Rs15.8tr.
A large chunk — 69pc of the value and 41pc of volume — in digital transactions comes from funds transfer. The second largest component still happens to be automated teller machines (ATM), processing 208.6m transactions worth Rs2.96tr in Q1-FY24.

Online transactions through banks, microfinance banks, and EMIs clocked in at 561m for Q1-FY24 as against 141.3m done over the counter

That’s actually one of the caveats with what we regard as digital, as it includes both real-time online branches (RTOB) and ATMs. In my narrow view, neither of them should really be counted as they are more paper-based from a customer’s point of view.
Therefore, let’s stick to point-of-sales (POS), e-commerce, internet, and mobile banking (MB). So, let’s go over the key trends from the latest edition and put the numbers in context.
For starters, mobile banking throughput clocked in at Rs8.3tr in Q1-FY24, from Rs4.2tr in the same period last year. This translated into a growth of 96.8pc — the highest for any channel by a distance. On the other hand, the increase in transactions of 63.6pc was, in comparison, much lower but took the volumes to 212.5m.
While much less impressive than MB, internet banking also had a pretty healthy quarter. Throughput jumped 32.9pc to cross Rs5tr in Q1-FY24, breaching the threshold for the first time. Volumes also grew 22.43pc to 49.1m, from 40.1m in the same period of the last fiscal year. As a result, the average transaction size reached Rs102,269 — the biggest for any retail channel in our review.
For the last year or so, e-commerce has been a bit of a dark spot among the digital retail channels. The growth has been quite muted; volume-wise, the latest quarter’s 9.6m is still below the peak seen in October-December 2021. However, acquiring throughput has continued to edge up and reached Rs39.6bn in Q1-FY24, from Rs33.5bn in the same period last year.
On the other hand, point of sale has continued to outshine most other channels as throughput reached Rs323bn in Q1-FY24, up 49.3pc from Rs307.5bn in the same period last year. Volume-wise, the growth rate of 40.8pc was even more impressive and second only to mobile banking. As a result, total transactions hit 59.8m, up 42.8m in the first quarter of FY23.
“While there’s been significant growth in digital payments activity, we haven’t even scratched the surface yet as most spending remains concentrated to a select few big merchants. Only 118,000 machines are live at the moment and even fewer retailers. Most of Pakistan’s five million small- and medium-enterprises are still entirely cash based and mostly outside the tax net too,” said Saad Niazi, co-founder and CEO of Keenu, one of the leading POS operators in Pakistan.
“In order to truly push digital payments into the mainstream, we need to bring these merchants online. That requires efforts from all stakeholders, including the Federal Board of Revenue, while the SBP must incentivise incumbents to deploy more machines without operating on negative margins for the sake of market share. The industry needs to see some way to make a return from their investments,” he added.
There was some improvement in terms of infrastructure and acceptance as well. On the issuing side, total payment cards increased by 2.7m over the previous quarter to 54.3m as of Q1-FY24, while the EMIs also took their total e-wallets to 2.4m.
Similarly, acquiring activity increased by adding 421 e-commerce merchants and 3,156 POS terminals.
This time around, the SBP experimented with a new reporting approach as it presented data by type of transaction instead of channel, which made comparison to previous reports a little trickier. No breakdown was available for Raast either. Hopefully, with the proper rollout of its person-to-merchant module, that’d change, and we’d see information at a more granular level.

10,Shifting sands of oil politics,"Imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, two of the largest oil producers in Opec, are expected to account for roughly only 10pc.","New details and statistics continue to emerge, pointing to the shrinking geopolitical clout of major Arab oil producers. The countries in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies in the Opec+ are no longer the sole arbiters of the supply side of the global energy dynamics. Markets are no longer in their absolute control. And this carries major geopolitical consequences for them.
The changing trends are becoming more evident by the day. Courtesy of the shale revolution and resultantly its crude output touching 13.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent months, the United States is today the world’s largest oil producer. In contrast, Saudi Arabia’s output is roughly around 9m bpd. Roughly speaking, the US output is 1.5 times the Saudi output.
And while the US is the world’s largest producer, one needs to concede that its consumption is also the highest in the world. This means that despite producing at unprecedented levels, the United States is still an oil importer.
However, unlike the gone-by era, Washington no longer depends on Arab oil producers, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and the like, to meet its requirements. Roughly 80 per cent of its imports are from the Western hemisphere, says Ken Roberts in a recent Forbes piece.

Imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, two of the largest oil producers in Opec, are expected to account for roughly only 10pc of the total US demand

Canada and Mexico alone are now supplying about two-thirds of the US oil imports. Canada is, by far, the largest source of US oil imports, at 55.67pc through October. Mexico is second, at 12.09pc — meaning these two countries account for over two-thirds of all US oil imports by value. Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Guyana are also in the top 10, pushing the total from the Western Hemisphere above 80pc. 
On the other hand, in 2023, US oil imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq — two of the largest Opec oil producers — are expected to account for roughly only 10 per cent of the total US demand. That’s the second lowest percentage on record, according to the latest US Census Bureau data, through October.
Providing some context, Mr Roberts said that for six of the seven years between 2012 and 2018, just the Saudi’s and Iraqi’s accounted for more than 20pc of US oil imports. Today, it is 10pc — roughly half its share of the US oil market in the last decade.
The Opec+ policy of cutting output to balance the markets and putting a floor beneath it is also proving to be a double-edged sword, contributing to the drop in its global market share. It may have helped bring in some support to the crude markets, yet it has also reduced the Opec share in the market, Charles Kennedy said in a recent Oilprice.com piece.
Opec could potentially face further loss of market share in early 2024 following the recent departure of Angola, weakening global crude demand, and the rising output by non-Opec producers, a Reuters recently underlined based on its calculations. Reuters is of the view that Opec’s production is set to slip below 27m bpd without Angola, good for less than 27pc of the total global supply of 102m bpd.
Traditionally, Opec has managed to maintain a market share in the 30-40pc range. However, record shale production by the United States has cut into that deeply, Reuters added. To protect its market share, Opec cannot sustain cutting its output for long. At some point shortly, it may be forced to change its direction, some assert.
While analysing Opec’s market share, one also needs to point out that the US Department of the Interior has signed off on three new oil and gas lease auctions in the Gulf of Mexico. This also indicates that the Saudi and the Opec grip on the oil markets could loosen further, Simon Watkins pointed out in a recent write-up.
These auctions will augment many other new explorations and developments of conventional and shale projects announced over the past year by the US’s big oil and gas firms. This includes the greenlight for US oil giant ConocoPhillips’s $8 billion Willow oil and gas drilling project in Alaska, he emphasised.
Consequently, Saudi Arabia and its Arab oil-producing allies are losing some of their political clout and leverage in Washington. The first indications of this began emerging during the Obama era. In 2015, despite the insistence of the Saudis to actively help the Syrian opposition to get rid of Bashar Al-Assad’s regime, Obama refused.
Further, the Saudis were also baffled by the lack of support by the Obama administration in 2011 to the beleaguered Hosni Mubarak regime in Egypt. Riyadh kept requesting Washington to help prevent the downfall of Mubarak, yet, to no avail.
And the reason behind not conceding to the Saudi requests was apparent. The US was no longer dependent on Saudi oil. Hence, staying oblivious to the requests of the oil-rich Saudi Arabia, Washington preferred taking an independent approach in its policy directions. The missing oil factor was evident in the US calculations.
These were eye-openers to Riyadh. The ongoing shift in Saudi foreign policy, drifting away from the US and striving to foster a still closer relationship with the Chinese camp, is also noteworthy. Riyadh is paying back the US in the same coin. 
Further, China, and not the United States, is now the world’s most important and largest crude buyer. Financially speaking, to Saudi Arabia and Opec, Chinese crude purchases are now their lifeline.
And then alternatives to oil are also on the horizon. Electric vehicles are taking over from traditional internal combustion engines in a big way. This is beginning to put pressure on global crude consumption dynamics.
Consequently, the ongoing emphasis throughout the energy-rich Arab world is to diversify their economy away from oil. Most oil producers now realise that to ensure their prosperity, they cannot rely on oil as their sole source of earning. They need to earn through other sources.
Hence, there is a desperate Saudi drive to invest in sectors other than oil — from golf to soccer and Nintendo in Japan to Vale Basic Materials in Brazil.
Interestingly, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) was the top spender among global sovereign wealth funds last year, accounting for about a quarter of the $124bn splashed by state-owned investors, according to a preliminary report by research consultancy Global SWF, CNBC reported. 
The research said the Saudi fund boosted its deal activities from $20.7bn in 2022 to $31.6bn in 2023. The PIF, controlled by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, currently has estimated assets of $776bn, the CNBC report added.
Oil is losing its glitter. It will still be in use for decades, yet it will not remain a strategic product for long. Its implications will be felt in every sector — from economics to politics. We are a witness to this ongoing transition.

Bank Alfalah Limited recently achieved two significant milestones, as per a press release. It launched its 1,000th branchas well as surpassed Rs2tr in deposits. Bank Alfalah has been able to double its deposits from Rs1tr to Rs2tr within only two and a half years. The journey has been of over 26 years ago, starting in 1997, when investors from Abu Dhabi, led by the Chairman, His Excellency Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, acquired three branches of Habib Credit and Exchange Bank Limited in Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi. With the vision to transform the banking landscape in Pakistan and improve access to finance, the institution was renamed ‘Bank Alfalah’, which has consistently prioritised innovation and customer-centricity for over two decades. 
Developing a new SME index
The Bank of Punjab (BOP) and Reenergia-Ipsos entered into an agreement last week for the development of a “Pakistan SME Environment & Performance Index (BOP-PAK-SEPI)”. The index, the first of its kind, will track the environment and the performance of SMEs in Pakistan on a periodical basis. SEPI will incorporate the existing Business Enabling Environment Index for Pakistan (BEEIP) developed with financing support of USAID for Pakistan by Reenergia-Ipsos. 
It shall be a dynamic tool providing the much-needed detailed insights into the performance of the SME sector as a whole along with supplying granular details on SME sub-segments and clusters, thus helping towards more informed policy-making, regulations and targeted financial interventions as well as capturing demographic cuts along the lines of women-led and export-oriented SMEs.

12,Islamic banking — need of the hour,A pragmatic path towards Sharia-compliant banking needs to be carved together with all relevant stakeholders.,"As a global concept, Islamic banking has established itself on a sound and solid footing. Almost every country with a substantial financial base offers Islamic banking operations parallel to conventional financing. However, the situation in Pakistan is rather complex. 
Pakistan’s constitutional structure makes it compulsory for the state to shift from conventional banking to Islamic banking after the unanimous decision of the Federal Shariat Court on April 28, 2022. Here, it is important to have a brief on the constitutionality of Islamic financing in Pakistan. 
First, we need to acknowledge that the Objectives Resolution making Islam the very basis of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is now a substantive part of the Constitution by virtue of Article 2A of the Constitution. Moreover, Article 38(f) obligates the state to eliminate Riba as early as possible. 
Although both these provisions are not enforceable by the superior courts on the same footing as in the case of fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 8 to 28 of the Constitution, these principles are quite unique in global constitutional history. 

A pragmatic path towards Sharia-compliant banking needs to be carved together with all relevant stakeholders 

More so, the Islamic principles in Pakistan’s Constitution are also declared as “Salient features” of the Constitution by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in various landmark decisions. 
Without regard to the aforesaid provisions and determinations of the superior courts, there is a separate judicial forum in Pakistan termed the Federal Shariat Court (FSC), and then there is the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
The precise function of the FSC and Shariat Appellate Bench is to determine whether any law on the statute book operative in Pakistan is repugnant to the injunctions of the Quran and Sunnah. If yes, the FSC has every right to strike down the same under Article 203D(2) of the Constitution, hence the 2022 judgment of the FSC. 
The FSC, after a very lengthy and scholarly debate, handed over a 318-page judgment declaring interest-based conventional banking as repugnant to the injunctions of Quran and Sunnah. The FSC has provided a deadline of December 31, 2027, for the complete elimination of interest-based banking in Pakistan. 
Although the decision of FSC is ipso facto stayed till the finalisation of appeal by the Shariat Appellate Bench by virtue of the proviso to Article 203D(2) of the Constitution, yet the state has to make preemptive arrangements for tackling this phenomenon. Tomorrow, if not today, we have to adopt the Islamic banking mode. 
For this to happen, the state has to engage all conventional banks to shift their banking model to an asset-backed Islamic banking model. Here, it must be noted that there are subtle interpretational differences between religious schools of thought within Islam. 
Before investing any further time and expense on any particular school’s methodology, the state should come forward and place the matter before a collective forum comprising bankers, economists, accountants, ulemas, politicians and other academics/practitioners etc. 
The same exercise was conducted back in the 1980s, whereby the Council of Islamic Ideology came forward with a roadmap on converting the entire conventional banking into Islamic banking. 
However, that document, along with other such laborious works, including the decision of the FSC of 1991, the Supreme Court Shariat Appellate Larger Bench’s decision of 1999 and the Supreme Court’s review judgement of 2002, must be put under thorough discussion. The models followed by Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Iran may also be considered for undertaking this holistic exercise.
The situation at hand, therefore, demands a pragmatic approach with due regard to the legal as well as international financial obligations. Islam prescribes a balanced and pragmatic approach to the solution of intricate problems. Conversion of conventional banking is one of them. The question of Islamic banking must not be left to the corner as was done in the last 30 years. 
Factually speaking, Pakistan, in the present global scenario and because of its financial compulsions, cannot divorce itself from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We are currently in an IMF support programme, and the next government will likely continue with the IMF.
The issue with the IMF is that it doesn’t accept the difference between the state of Pakistan and the government of Pakistan. The argument that the judiciary and its decisions (be they of the Federal Shariat Court) are independent of the government’s influence is not considered by the IMF in any discussion. 
The IMF treats Pakistan as a borrower entity, and no further constitutional limitations on the government of Pakistan are accepted by the IMF. In this scenario, Pakistan, as a sovereign state, has to take a collective stand and carve out a pragmatic path towards Islamic banking. 
The federal and provincial governments, along with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the judiciary’s concurrence, have to devise a practical way forward so that the investment climate in cash-starved Pakistan doesn’t get hampered.    
The SBP’s initiative of establishing Islamic banking windows by commercial banks deserves appreciation. The successful operation of Islamic banking windows by commercial banks is surely an achievement worth capitalising on. However, much reformation in legal and fiscal domains is still awaited.

13,Discouraging corporate Pakistan,The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) recently published a report suggesting what the incoming government can do for ...,"The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) recently published a report suggesting what the incoming government can do for an economically stronger Pakistan. Among its many suggestions was fixing the disproportionate tax incidence.
Arguing that the current taxation regime incentivises the informal economy, the PBC said the lamentable tax-to-GDP ratio will not improve till political will translates into a broader tax base.  This requires the government to stop increasing taxes as a ‘kneejerk reaction’ every time it wants to raise revenue. Even in Special Economic Zones, where companies are supposed to be exempt, firms must pay turnover taxes.
Taxing the topline as opposed to profits is particularly problematic as it penalises large capital-intensive projects where a tax loss is normal in the initial years, thus effectively discouraging much-needed investment in the country. Given the high prevalence of cash-based transactions, the PBC called for the discontinuation of the Rs5,000 note, along with restrictions on cash for big-ticket spending, to bring the black market and informal economy within the tax net.
Without an effective, prolonged exercise of tax reforms, the government will further alienate corporations in the country.

14,Murky politics in a fragile economy,All sub-nationalities need to be equitably empowered to work together to mobilise the country’s unutilised local resources,"In the development decade of the 1960s, the issue of trade and not aid cropped up because much of the industrialisation was debt-driven and business leaders started talking about increasing domestic savings, investment, production and exports.
But over time, the trade gap mostly continued to widen. Tight monetary policy to depress domestic demand and ease external sector pressures resulted in de-industrialisation. Farm production suffered badly due to backward cultural practices and a lack of modernisation of agriculture. Agri-food imports rose by 64 per cent to $3.847 billion during July-December 2023.
Foreign investment was attracted with no priority set for development but to shore up dollar reserves, ignoring its overall economic impact. Now, repatriation of dividends and profits invariably exceed foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, forcing the authorities to restrict remittances to their parent companies.
Foreign firms are reported to have divested their assets or temporarily reduced or halted their operations in Pakistan since 2022. Ignoring past experience, an effort is being made to attract FDI from friendly Arab countries without rationalising FDI policy.

All sub-nationalities need to be equitably empowered to work together to mobilise the country’s unutilised local resources 

The thinking (of the caretaker government) that we must first bring foreign investment is flawed, said one of the country’s leading entrepreneur’s Muhammad Ali Tabba in an interview. 
Stressing the need for a long-term investment policy, he pointed out that there is a lot of cash in the private sector and system. It is just that it is not being motivated to invest locally. Similarly, he also identified sectors which could be developed through joint foreign-local ventures based on indigenous resources. 
Often aware of the hassles involved in setting up new projects, some foreign investors prefer to work with local partners. This is also evident from foreign investors currently taking up stakes in existing companies where risks are much lower and returns much quicker.
Unless foreign investment in joint ventures is matched by sizeable local equity, the bulk of dollars would be spent on new projects and would not provide much support for building up dollar reserves. Foreign investors also expect more incentives for new projects in adverse business environments.

Foreign investors expect more incentives for new projects in adverse business environments

Among other factors, political uncertainty weighed heavily on business and consumer sentiments, resulting in a contraction of 0.2pc real GDP in FY23, says State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmed. That brings into question whether economic stability can be achieved without political stability.
Some pin hopes that the next government, empowered with a fresh electoral mandate, will undertake long-term reforms to build upon short-term improvements in some macroeconomic indicators, including a reduction in trade and current account deficit as a result of administrative and regulatory actions taken by the caretaker government and the central bank.
The view is not shared by many others. With the impression that electoral manipulation is afoot, analysts fear such an eventuality could damage democracy and national cohesion. The outlook for political stability after the general elections appears murky. 
Speaking at a press conference after the rejection of the nomination papers of his and his party candidates, Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal warned that if justice was not served, the matter would be taken to the people of Balochistan. “If you weaken the political parties, you weaken the federation,” warned PML-N Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, addressing the Senate recently.
Dealing with Pakistan’s estranged nationalists needs political sagacity and a willingness to accept them as equal citizens of Pakistan who have been wronged, says Pervez Hoodbhoy. Otherwise, he warns, be prepared for unending militancy and a miserable 2024.
As it appears, Pakistan’s external sector challenges will also become more formidable. Among the big issues and trends listed by eminent international scholars and political economists that will dominate global attention in 2024 are threats to democracy, major wars, looming economic risks and multiplying humanitarian crises. The Israeli massacre of Palestinians, it is argued, will bring seismic change in global geopolitics as ‘guns do not kill ideas but reinforce them’.
It is time for people of all sub-nationalities to be equitably empowered to work together in harmony to unleash the potential for mobilising the country’s unutilised local cash, human, and physical resources required for national reconstruction.

To better motivate your team, ask three questions focused on the past, the present, and the future. Look backwards: What have you accomplished, and what about it makes you proud? These questions give you insight into the kind of work your team members like to do and what about that work makes them feel motivated. Look at today: What is getting in your way? This question can help surface demotivators or things that are frustrating your team and sapping their motivation. A big part of your job as a leader is to remove the barriers blocking their potential. Look forward: What would you like to do more of? This final question opens the door to what your team members would enjoy taking on.

Splitting the cheque
In 2023, 49pc of restaurants in the US reported lower check averages and 53pc reported lower profits compared with the year before, according to the James Beard Foundation, a restaurant-focused nonprofit. At the same time, dining out has grown more expensive: The latest consumer-price index showed the cost of food away from home climbed 5.3pc over the 12 months ended in November. This is because restaurantgoers are looking to split entrees or stick with starters to save. When diners share fewer dishes or linger too long, it can be tough to offset expenses like higher labour costs, says Anne McBride, vice president of programs at the James Beard Foundation. In 2022, 21pc of diners said they split an entree to lower the cost of a meal within the previous six months, and 58pc said they would keep doing so, according to market research from Datassential.

Bad economic crystal gazing
One year ago, 85pc of economists in one poll predicted a recession in 2023 — and that was an optimistic take compared to the 100pc probability of a recession forecast two months earlier. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed fear last March that bringing down the rate of inflation would cost millions of American jobs. And yet, none of this has happened. Both inflation and unemployment are headed in the right direction, and most economists expect the US to avoid a recession in 2024. Economists have yet to figure out why things went so well, but it is already clear that a reckoning is due. The solution here is not to sweep past doctrine under the rug; it’s to be more forthright. Macroeconomists very often don’t know what is going on, and that holds true for all the different styles and flavours of macro.

Tycoons and Modi
A handful of tycoons will shape India’s economy in an important election year — and beyond. The current consensus among political analysts is for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retain power in this year’s general elections. In that case, expect a further consolidation of wealth in the hands of Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest businessman, and Gautam Adani, his closest rival — a validation of what Arvind Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the Modi administration, has described as India’s “2A variant of stigmatised capitalism,” in which the private sector as a whole can’t be trusted. While there is a strong possibility that India, still a lower-middle-income economy, will have not one but two centi-billionaires in 2024, there are dangers of allowing — even encouraging — a handful of business groups to consolidate wealth in a few hands.
