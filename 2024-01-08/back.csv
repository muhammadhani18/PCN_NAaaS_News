3,Bilawal decries ‘traditional politicians’,Claims Lahore belongs to neither ‘sportsman’ nor ‘businessman’,"PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that Lahore does not belong to either a “sportsman” or “a businessman” in an apparent reference to his political rivals – PTI founder Imran Khan, a former cricketer, and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, a former businessman – before their entry into politics.
""This is the city of [PPP founder] Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, but these people believe that by assassinating Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, and the Jiyalas, they will succeed in intimidating us. They are mistaken. We will defeat them on their home turf,” Bilawal said.
The PPP chief expressed these views on Sunday while addressing corner meetings at the NA-127 constituency of Lahore. Bilawal said he is contesting elections from the same city where Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto contested elections.
“They ask us why we have come to Lahore? We ask them why they ruled over Lahore? It was General Ziaul Haq, General Hamid Gul, and General Faiz Hameed who imposed these politicians on Lahore and Punjab,” he said.
Bilawal said he is doing politics in this city because of the sacrifices of Jiyalas, a word used to refer to PPP workers. “We do politics for the poor, laborers, and the white-collar class. We do politics for the hardworking people of this city, so we seek support from the people, and we only believe in the people.""
He told the party workers that they should go door to door and propagate the PPP’s manifesto, delivering its ten-point economic agenda to the people.
Read Bilawal dismisses ‘polls delay’ notion
“God willing, we will implement every point of this agenda. Within five years of coming into power, we'll double salaries, provide free electricity up to 300 units for the poor, and offer standardized education and healthcare facilities so that those who travel to London for treatment can have the same international standard of care here,"" he said.
He said Bhutto introduced the five-marla scheme, while Benazir introduced the seven-marla scheme. “When we come into power, we will build 3 million houses for the people, registered in the name of women. Additionally, we will regularize informal settlements across the country.""
The PPP chief expressed resolve to expand the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and introduce worker cards, farmer cards, and youth cards. He also pledged to initiate a hunger eradication programme.
He claimed that the traditional politicians practice politics of hatred, division, and revenge, representing the aristocracy, while the PPP speaks for the oppressed.
“We will change the fate of the country. The PPP is an alternative to traditional politics, led by the youth. Insha'Allah, we will win. It will be a victory for justice, a victory for Benazir Bhutto, a victory for Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a victory for the people, your victory, and the victory of the people of Lahore,"" he said.

5,"Imran didn’t write any article, claims official",IG prisons says ex-PM not provided with paper and pen facilities in his jail cell,"Jail authorities have claimed that the article of PTI founding chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan published in a British weekly newspaper was not his own writing.
IG Prisons Mian Farooq Nazir said Imran’s “room-like barrack” at Adiala Jail had been declared a high security zone and was monitored round the clock with cameras, staff and other secret devices.
He further maintained that anyone who came to meet the PTI founding chairman was searched according to the jail rules.
The official added that the security personnel posted at the barrack were also searched at the beginning and end of their duty.
According to the IG prisons, Imran was only allowed to read books.
He continued that even those books were given to him after thoroughly examining them.
Read Decision reserved on Imran's disqualification appeal
The official said the deposed premier was not provided with paper and pen facilities in his jail cell.
“There is no such means that Imran Khan can write something in jail and it can leave the prison,” he claimed.
The IG prisons vehemently denied that the article published in the British weekly newspaper was written by Imran himself.
In an opinion piece carried by the British publication allegedly written by Imran at Adiala Jail, the deposed premier allegedly expressed fears that the election scheduled for February 8 might not take place at all.
He purportedly added that even if the polls were held, they would be a “disaster and a farce” as the PTI was being “denied” its basic right to campaign.
A day earlier, caretaker Federal Information Minister Murtaza Solangi announced that the government would write to the British publication that carried the article allegedly written by Imran.
In a social media post, the minister added that it was “puzzling and disconcerting” that a media outlet published an article in the name of an individual who was in jail and had been convicted.
Solangi maintained if “jailed convicts” were free to publish articles, they would only “air their one-sided grievances”.
He stressed the need to uphold ethical standards and promote responsible journalism.

6,Bilawal says Imran should not be in jail if innocent,PPP chairman asserts elections will not be delayed 'no matter what',"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founding chairman Imran Khan should not be in prison if he is innocent.
""If Khan Sahab is innocent, he should not be in jail, but if he is guilty, he should stay imprisoned,"" the Bhutto dynasty scion said while speaking to the media after the hearing of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto presidential reference.
Bilawal referred to the current political climate of the country, saying: ""What is happening now is not that bad, as much worse has happened in the past.""
The former foreign minister also said that the PPP was in favour of hearing Bhutto’s case before the general elections rather than after.
“We want the decision to come before the elections,” he said, adding that initially, the PPP was hopeful that the case would be presided over consistently, “but now we just hope that the verdict will come immediately after the elections”.
The PPP leader said that he was hopeful that they would get justice in this case and that history would be corrected.
Regarding the rumours surrounding the change in the election date, the PPP scion maintained that ""no matter what"", elections would take place on Feb 8.
“If three or four senators stand up and say something, then are their words more powerful or does the constitutional and the legal decision of the chief justice carry more weight,” he said, referring to the recent resolution passed by 14 Senate members.

In response to a question by a journalist, Bilawal said that Karachi had witnessed development under the PPP’s tenure.
“This is the first time that the PPP won in both Karachi and the local body elections.”
He added that the party secured seats in numerous districts of Multan and defeated the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
“We are positive that the people of Karachi will definitely give the PPP a chance and for the first time. Karachi’s local body system, Sindh’s provincial (system) and the federal government’s system will be with the Peoples Party.”
Speaking about the external influence over the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Bilawal said that the PTI was given the electoral cricket symbol ‘bat’ as the people of Pakistan love the sport.
To another question, the PPP leader commented that when fake cases were being filed against them (the PPP), Imran would say that the institutions were independent and liable to provide justifications.
“Now, Khan Sahab should also approach these institutions.”
He also stated that the PTI founder was suffering from the same things he had done previously.
“The norm of putting people in jail and making cases is not right, but this norm was established by Khan Sahab himself,” he said, adding that he first needed to repent and then such traditions should be abolished.

7,ECP urged to tackle parties' concerns ahead of polls,K-P governor asks the electoral body to call a high-level meeting of political parties,"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Ghulam Ali has urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to address the apprehensions raised by various political parties regarding the February 8 general elections.
Speaking to a private news channel, he called on the electoral body to convene a high-level meeting of the political parties that have expressed misgivings before the elections or a few days after them to take action after hearing their concerns.
He said that it was the provincial government’s duty to improve the law and order situation and protect the people.
Governor Ali highlighted the shared responsibility among the federal government, state institutions, and the army's commitment to deploying troops and offering the necessary support.
Addressing the issues of “law and order, 18-hour-long load-shedding, and toughest winter” hampering the electoral process, Governor Ali highlighted concerns among the public about the lack of momentum.
He stressed the challenges faced in regions such as Naran, Kalam, Swat, and Chitral due to harsh winter conditions, including reports forecasting snowfall in Peshawar.
He emphasised that despite these challenges, all political parties he engaged with expressed their desire for the elections to proceed, emphasising their demand for peace and protection.
Read ECP rejects PTI’s contempt claim
Asserting a “respectful request and suggestion” to the ECP, Governor Ali urged the commission to engage directly with the political parties and “convince” them about the security measures in place.
While acknowledging that the constitutional timeframe for holding elections had passed, Governor Ali stressed the need to consider these reservations.
He underscored the severity of the winter in Peshawar, raising questions about the feasibility of voter turnout in such conditions.
The statement came against the backdrop of reservations expressed by certain circles over security apprehensions tied to the ECP’s planned schedule.
On Friday, the Senate saw the passing of a resolution. Independent Senator Dilawar Khan spearheaded the resolution, advocating for a postponement of the polls due to prevailing security concerns.
However, the resolution’s passage faced widespread criticism from a spectrum of political parties. The caretaker information minister reiterated that neither the prime minister nor the federal cabinet had issued any directive calling for a delay in the elections.
Meanwhile, efforts were made to challenge the legitimacy of the resolution; the Supreme Court was approached to invalidate it and take action against its proponents.
In response, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Senator Mushtaq Ahmed introduced a counter-resolution in the upper house the following day, underlining the importance of ensuring the timely execution of the polls.

8,SC rebukes PTI attorney for ‘political speech’,Tells Khosa to file written reply to ECP report on level playing field,"The Supreme Court on Monday directed the PTI to submit a written reply addressing reports from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the Punjab chief secretary regarding the provision of a fair electoral playing field for the upcoming general elections.
Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, leading a three-member bench, reprimanded PTI's lawyer Latif Khosa for delivering what was deemed a “political speech” rather than presenting legal arguments.
The bench, including Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali, resumed the hearing of PTI's petition seeking equitable opportunities in the February 8 general elections. The court had earlier instructed the ECP on December 22 to address PTI’s concerns, leading to a subsequent contempt petition by PTI, alleging the ECP’s non-compliance.
In response, the ECP and the Punjab chief secretary submitted rebuttals, rejecting PTI's claims. The ECP’s January 7 reply highlighted that returning officers had accepted nomination papers for over 76% of PTI candidates. The data showed approval for 598 out of 843 National Assembly and 1,398 out of 1,777 provincial assembly nomination papers.
Irked at the PTI counsel’s ""politicisation"" of the matter, the CJP asked Khosa if he wanted the SC to rule that all the nomination papers filed by his party’s candidates must be accepted.
“What is wrong with the [ECP’s] report?” Justice Isa asked.
The top judge asked Khosa to submit in writing anything that he thought was wrong with the ECP and Punjab chief secretary’s written replies. “Do not make verbal claims,” Justice Isa cautioned.
“Do not beat around the bush. Tell us exactly what you seek from the SC. If there is any state institution you don’t have faith in, tell us… we will pass a suitable order in light of that,” the CJP observed.
Khosa stated that “the whole country knows how we are being targeted”.
He said the party seeks a level playing field, adding that Section 144 has been imposed to impede the party's electoral activities while “other candidates” were not being stopped.
 
.Justice Isa asked Khosa what he meant by “other candidates”. Section 144 applies to all political parties.
Are you implying that the PML-N is also conspiring against the PPP and JUI-F, he added.
The bench also accepted the party’s request to take up its plea with regard to withdrawal of its iconic election symbol of a cricket bat. The SC will hear this case tomorrow—on January 10.
Meanwhile, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) is set to hear today, Tuesday, the PTI’s petition filed against the ECP’s decision to invalidate its December 2 intra-party elections, an order that resulted in depriving the party of its election symbol.
Talking to the media after the court hearing, PTI leader Gohar Ali Khan said participating in the electoral process is the constitutional right of the people. “The Supreme Court is obligated to safeguard the constitutional rights of the people,” he said.

9,Four new cases of JN1 Covid strain confirmed,"Health authorities remain vigilant, closely monitoring the situation","The emergence of a new coronavirus variant, JN1, a subvariant of Omicron, has raised concerns as four cases were confirmed on Sunday in Pakistan.
Despite mild symptoms exhibited by the infected individuals, health authorities remain vigilant.
The Ministry of Health spokesperson confirmed the recovery of all four patients without encountering any complications.
The development comes amid global attention on this new strain, with the World Health Organization (WHO) classifying JN1 as a ""variant of interest."" Presently, WHO assesses the risk to public health from this strain as low based on existing evidence.
Dr Nadeem Jan, the caretaker health minister, assured that authorities are closely monitoring the situation.
In response to the emergence of JN1, Border Health Services, alongside national and provincial health authorities and laboratories, are on high alert to ensure robust disease surveillance.
Read New Covid-19 variant detected at Karachi airport
Rigorous screening measures have been implemented at international airports across entry and exit points.
Dr Jan emphasised the implementation of international health regulations by the Border Health Services Department and highlighted the comprehensive readiness of both federal and provincial bodies.
Notably, approximately 90% of Pakistan's population has received vaccination against Covid-19, a critical measure in combatting the spread of such variants.
As winter brings its own challenges, Dr Jan reiterated the importance of preventive measures, urging the public to continue wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and following health guidelines to curb the spread of Covid-19 and other infectious diseases.
It is pertinent to note that a few days ago, the federal government had decided to secure 500,000 doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in response to the potential resurgence of the new variant observed in multiple countries.
The procurement strategy for Pfizer vaccines from the US was devised based on recommendations from the Emergency Operation Centre’s (EOC) technical advisory group.
On Friday, the Sindh Health Department confirmed the presence of a new variant of Covid-19 in two passengers arriving from overseas at Karachi Airport. However, it had clarified that no cases of the variant have been reported within the Sindh province.
