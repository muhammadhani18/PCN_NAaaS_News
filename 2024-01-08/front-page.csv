0,"In Kabul, Fazl confident of a breakthrough","JUI-F chief to hold key meetings from today; says Senate resolution seeking poll delay ""endorses his stance"".","PESHAWAR: JUI-F emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman arrived in Kabul on Sunday to hold talks with senior Afghan Taliban leaders on the regional security situation, a spokes­man for his party said.
Upon his arrival, traffic was stopped on the road leading from Kabul’s international airport to the venue of his stay, with due security protocol.
The JUI-F leader, who is leading a nine-member delegation comprising party leaders from Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa and Balochistan, will be holding a series of meetings in Kabul.
Afghan Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, in a brief statement on X, confirmed the Maulana’s arrival in the Afghan capital.
 






In an audio WhatsApp message shared with Dawn, Mr Mujahid said the Pakistani politician was due to attend a dinner hosted by Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Third Deputy Prime Minster for Political Affairs.

JUI-F chief to hold key meetings from today; says Senate resolution seeking poll delay ‘endorses his stance’

The duration of Maulana Fazl’s stay in Kabul is not clear, but the Afghan Taliban say his formal engagements with key Taliban leaders would begin today (Monday).
Pakistan’s Charge d’affaires Obaidur Rehman Nizamani is also expected to attend the meetings.
JUI-F spokesman Aslam Ghouri said the party leader was visiting Kabul at the invitation of the Afghan Taliban leadership to discuss regional and security issues.
Maulana Fazl has said that he would raise Pakistan’s security concerns with the Afghan Taliban and listen to their grievances as well.
 
 

The JUI-F said he was confident to break the ice between the two sides and resolve issues.
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have soured in recent months due to an uptick in terrorist attacks which Islamabad says are carried out by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) operating from inside the neighbouring country.
Negotiations between Pakistan and the banned TTP collapsed over the latter’s refusal to disband, lay down arms and surrender to the state. The militant outfit had also demanded Pakistan rescinded the law that had allowed for the merger of tribal districts into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Kabul, which has hosted and facilitated negotiations between Pakistan and the TTP, denies the militant outfit operates from Afghanistan and has urged Pakistan to address its internal security challenges instead of blaming others.
The relationship between the two neighbours took a further hit when Pakistan started deporting illegal Afghans. Nearly half a million undocumented Afghans have so far left Pakistan since November 1, last year.
Interestingly, the JUI chief has also been the vocal critic of the Fata’s merger into KP, saying the legislation was made without the will and consent of tribal people.
The party emir and some senior JUI-F figures have survived suicide bombings, apparently by the TTP, which has been accusing the party leadership of betraying Islamic principles by believing in democratic principles. The Maulana has on several occasions made it publicly clear that his party did not believe in enforcement of sharia through armed struggle.
It is not clear how the banned TTP, which has also targeted ANP and PPP, would react to the Afghan Taliban’s overtures towards the JUI-F or that the militant outfit would even listen to their Afghan patrons and host.
Senate move backed
Separately, Maulana Fazl threw his weight behind a controversial resolution, passed by the Senate on Friday, seeking a delay in the Feb 8 polls on security and weather concerns. He said the Senate resolution endorsed his party’s stance that security situation was not conducive for holding the elections.
“Sky will not fall if elections are postponed for the sake of a better atmosphere,” the JUI-F leader said in an interview with Geo News.
 


He said the atmosphere was not conducive for polls as the JUI-F could not hold rallies after the party leaders received threats. However, he said, “If polls are enforced on us, we will not escape but contest the polls.”
The JUI-F chief said that gravity of the situation must be realised and such an atmosphere should be provided in which his party could reach their voters to seek votes. “The atmosphere in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is not suitable for elections.”
‘Bold leadership’
Reacting to the Maulana’s remarks, PPP Secretary Information Faisal Karim Kundi said “the country needs bold leaders”.
 






In a statement, he said PPP conducted its campaign bravely during the 2008, 2013 and 2018 elections when the wave of terrorism was worse than today.
Mr Kundi said some people were afraid of the possible decision of the nation through ballot and therefore they wanted escape from the polls. “People should not be deprived of choosing the government they like only on the whims of some individuals,” he added.

1,Four killed in Kurram passenger van attack,"KURRAM: Four pers­ons, including a woman, were killed in an armed attack on a passenger van near Sadda bazaar of...","KURRAM: Four pers­ons, including a woman, were killed in an armed attack on a passenger van near Sadda bazaar of dist­r­ict Kurram on Sunday, local police have confirmed.
The vehicle was on its way from Parachinar to Pesh­a­war when it came under attack, along with a car, acco­­rding to Kurram police.
The attack also left three people injured, who were moved to the Para­chinar district headquarters hospital, said Dr Qaisar Abbas, the hospital’s deputy medical superintendent.  
Kurram District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Imran Mirza told Dawn.com that the deceased included two security personnel.
He added that the vehicles were targeted by gunmen with automated wea­pons, and efforts were under­­way to arrest the culprits.
According to local officials, this is the fourth such attack in the district since December 26, 2023, when two persons were killed and five injured in an attack on a passenger vehicle which was on its way from the Kothi Bala area of district Hangu to Parachinar.
Earlier on January 1, two passengers sustained injuries in an attack on a van near the Pewar check-post area. Another attack followed three days later, on January 4, which left one person dead and another wounded.
With the rising attacks on vehicles, a jirga has been called to maintain peace in the area, Noor Chap Orakzai, a jirga member, told Dawn on Sunday.
He added that the district administration arrested 20 people after the last [land] dispute and that they were “trying to maintain peace in the area”.
“We will start our efforts as soon as the four persons [who died on Sunday] are laid to rest.”. He added that the future course of action would be shared after the jirga meeting.
Sajid Hussain Turi, a former MNA from Kurram constituency, said the situation was worsening with each passing day, and locals were panicking.
Locals have questioned the security along the route between Peshawar and Thall-Parachinar road, which connects Parachinar to other parts of KP.
They have said that travellers faced serious problems due to recurring armed attacks.
“Attacks are taking place despite the presence of the Levies and Khasadar force deployed on the route,” while referring to a local force tasked with maintaining law and order.
Mir Afzal Khan, a local youth activist, at a news conference demanded the government secure the route.

2,Jordan presses US on Gaza ceasefire,Blinken assures King Abdullah Washington opposes displacement of Palestinians.,"• Blinken assures King Abdullah Washington opposes displacement of Palestinians
• With 113 dead in last 24 hours, Gaza death toll hits 22,835  • Eight Palestinians killed in occupied West Bank
AMMAN: Jordan’s king on Sunday urged the top US diplomat to push for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and end the humanitarian crisis brought by three months of war.
King Abdullah II made the remarks to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on a Middle East tour aiming to ensure Israel’s war on Gaza does not spread.
 






He told Mr Blinken that Washington had a major role to play in pressuring Israel into an immediate ceasefire, and warned of the “catastrophic repercussions” of the continuation of war in Gaza, which began on Oct 7 after a Hamas raid on Israel.
Israel’s subsequent air and ground assault had killed 22,835 Palestinians by Sunday, according to Palestinian health officials, including at least 113 killed and 250 others injured over the past 24 hours.
 
 

An Israeli air strike on a car near Rafah in southern Gaza on Sunday claimed the lives of two Palestinian journalists who were out reporting, according to health officials in Gaza and the journalists’ union there.
In Amman, King Abdullah reiterated “the important role of the United States in bringing pressure for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, protection of civilians, and guaranteeing delivery” of medical and hum­anitarian aid, a statement from the royal palace said.
Washington has twice exercised its veto at the United Nations Security Council over ceasefire calls, drawing outrage in the Arab world, and Mr Blinken has bypassed Congress to rush weapons to Israel.
‘US opposes forcible displacement’
During the meeting, the US secretary of state assured King Abdullah that Washington opposed the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the occupied West Bank, as he hoped to kickstart talks on Gaza’s future.
Mr Blinken “stressed US opposition to forcible displacement of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza and the critical need to protect Palestinian civilians in the West Bank from extremist settler violence,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.
 






Blinken is touring the region amid heightened fears Israel’s offensive against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza will spark a broader regional conflagration.
Mr Blinken arrived in Jordan late on Saturday and met King Abdullah on Sunday before travelling to Qatar. In Doha, Blinken will discuss efforts to free the more than 100 hostages still believed to be held by Hamas after an earlier agreement mediated by Qatar broke down, a senior State Department official said. Blinken was scheduled to end the day in the United Arab Emirates.
Eight Palestinians killed in West Bank
Meanwhile, an air strike, gunfire and explosives across the occupied West Bank killed eight Palestinians and two Israelis on Sunday, officials on both sides said as violence surges in the territory.
Seven Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike in the area of Jenin refugee camp, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Israeli police said an officer was killed when her “vehicle… was hit by an explosive device” during a raid on the camp, adding that three other officers were wounded.
In a separate incident, a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli army fire in Abwein village north of Ramallah, said the health ministry.
Elsewhere in the Ramallah area, an Israeli civilian was shot dead, according to the army, which said forces were searching for the assailant.
The Israeli man was “killed adjacent to the British police junction” north of Ramallah, it said in a statement.

3,Pakistan steps up surveillance in Arabian Sea,"Navy says aerial monitoring increased, ships patrolling global shipping lanes.","KARACHI: Pakistan has stepped up naval and aerial surveillance of the Arabian Sea in a bid to protect traffic in international shipping lanes, the navy said on Sunday.
Pakistan Navy said it had deployed its ships in wake of the recent maritime security incidents in the Arabian Sea.
The development comes days after an Indian Navy warship intercepted a Bahrain-bound bulk carrier following reports that the vessel had been hijac­ked off the coast of Somalia.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the Pakistan Navy said it is “ensuring [a] permanent presence in the Arabian Sea to keep our and international sea lines of communications under intense surveillance”.

Navy says aerial monitoring increased, ships patrolling global shipping lanes

“Two to three ships are always patrolling the areas [where] Pakistan-bound and international merchant ships are plying. In addition, extensive air surveillance is also being undertaken to ensure the safety of international sea lines of communications passing through our maritime area.
 
 

Earlier, Reuters repor­ted that the hijacking and attempted hijacking of commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea resumed in December after a six-year lull.
Experts attributed this rise to the fact that pirates had been encouraged by US-led anti-piracy naval forces diverting their attention to the neighbouring Red Sea to thwart attacks there by Houthi forces from Yemen.
Maritime traffic has been disrupted over the past several weeks after the Houthis began carrying out attacks on vessels in the Gulf region to show their support for the people of Gaza.
Major shippers such as Maersk have paused or diverted their vessels away from the Red Sea — the shortest route from Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal — after a number of craft came under attack from Houthi drones and gunboats.
Even though India is not part of the US-led Red Sea task force, it had deployed ships in the region.
Following last week’s hijacking attempt, New Delhi had announced it was providing protective escorts to Indian container ships in the high seas around the Red Sea as the security situation there continues to simmer.
Earlier, the Indian navy had said that task groups of frigates and destroyers had been deployed in the central and northern Arabian Sea to assist merchant vessels passing through the region.
“Aerial surveillance by long-range maritime pat­rol aircraft and RPAs (Remotely Piloted Air­craft) has been enhanced to have a complete maritime domain awareness,” Reuters quoted a statement as saying.

4,Watchdog assures SC of fair play ahead of polls,"Two special secretaries looking after affairs as ECP secretary proceeds on ""medical leave"".","• Commission says 76pc of nomination papers filed by PTI candidates accepted, asks court to dismiss contempt plea
• ECP secretary proceeds on ‘medical leave’; spokesperson says will ‘resume duties if health permits’
• Two special secretaries looking after affairs of ECP secretariat; commission ‘fully functional’
ISLAMABAD: Shortly before its secretary proceeded on ‘medical leave’, the Election Commission of Pakistan appri­sed the Supreme Court that more than 76 per cent of the nomination papers submitted by the PTI aspirants for the 2024 general elections had been accepted.
According to Dawn.com, the ECP response was furnished on a PTI petition seeking contempt of court proceedings against the election watchdog and other stakeholders for the alleged violation of the apex court’s Dec 22 orders — in which the SC had directed the ECP to attend to the PTI’s grievances urgently and resolve these expeditiously — and lack of level playing field for the party in the lead-up to elections.
The PTI alleged that conspiracies were being hatched to exclude it from the Feb 8 elections as the party’s top leadership and its allies were knocked out of the polls race after almost “90pc of nominations from important leaders” failed to stand the scrutiny exercise. It also claimed that the nomination papers of party candidates had been snatched.
In response to these allegations, the electoral watchdog, citing data obtained by returning officers (ROs), said 598 out of a total of 843 nomination papers of PTI candidates for the National Assembly had been accepted. Similarly, 1,398 out of 1,777 candidatures for provincial assemblies had been accepted, according to a Dawn.com report.
 
 

According to the ECP, it had held a meeting with the PTI and assured the party that a level playing field would be provided to all candidates and also shared a number of steps taken by the watchdog on the matter of the level playing field.
“The commission has also issued instructions to the chief commissioner, Islamabad and all the four provincial chief secretaries, inspector(s) general of police, and all the four provincial election commissioners. In turn, the provincial election commissioners have issued the instructions to the DROs and ROs,” the ECP response added.
Similarly, the ECP maintained it had established complaint cells and contact numbers had been shared with the PTI. It said that action had been taken on all the complaints submitted by the PTI in all the four provinces and Islamabad.
“The ratio of acceptance of nomination papers of PTI candidates for election to the nation and provincial assemblies is 76.18pc,” the ECP said, highlighting that statistical data showed PTI candidates, their proposers, and seconders were provided with a level playing field. It highlighted that the party had a right to appeal the rejection of candidatures before the appellate election tribunal.
“The petitioner [PTI] has been unable to provide any proof that respondent 2 [ECP] has defied the order of the court dated Dec 22 in any manner whatsoever. The commission has taken all possible steps to comply with the order of the court dated Dec 22 […] therefore no contempt of this court is established as contemplated under Article 204 of the Constitution, the contempt petition ex-facie is not maintainable,” the ECP stated. It urged the court to dismiss PTI’s contempt plea.
Secretary ‘goes on leave’
In a surprise development, the ECP secretary, who looks after the administrative affairs of the commission, proceeded on ‘medical leave’ amid mysterious circumstances, sources told Dawn on Sunday.

Eye witness accounts revealed Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja in recent weeks snubbed the secretary during various meetings, fuelling speculations that Omar Hamid Khan had been sent on a “forced leave”.
An informed source said that last Friday the CEC “insulted” the ECP secretary during a meeting over his dismal performance, with the latter reportedly explaining that he was facing health problems.
According to sources, Mr Hamid offered to step down to ensure smooth functioning of the affairs ahead of general polls and the CEC reportedly advised him to prioritise his health.
Conflicting reports continued to flood the social media adding to the confusion surrounding the issue. Some reports suggested that the secretary had tendered resignation. But these speculations were put to the rest by the ECP spokesperson,
Syed Nadeem Haider, in a statement. “Omar Hamid Khan will shortly resume his responsibilities if his health permits,” said Mr Haider.
Calling Mr Hamid a brilliant and hard-working officer, he explained that the ECP secretary had been facing health problems for some time and had remained on medical rest. He said the ECP was fully functional and there was no hindrance in the way of its work.
He said in the absence of the secretary, two special secretaries were efficiently running the affairs of the ECP secretariat.
Mr Hamid told Dawn he had health problems.
He said he remained hospitalised for a few days but came home due to a scare of further infection.
He did not explain the nature of the illness, but an ECP official said he had lung infection and respiratory problems and was probably suffering from Covid-19.
On the other hand, caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi said there was no crisis and the ECP was fully functional.
 






Mr Hamid, a retired grade 22 officer of the Secretariat Group, was appointed the ECP secretary in July 2021 on a two-year contract, which expired last year and was extended for another year.
He had earlier served as secretary of finance, secretary Benazir Income Support Programme, and secretary of national food security among other important positions.
He also served as spokesman for the interior minister, when Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan was at the helm.
