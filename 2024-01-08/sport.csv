1,Late Frattesi goal gives Inter win over Verona in dramatic finish,MILAN: Inter Milan substitute Davide Frattesi struck in added time as the Serie A leaders snatched a 2-1 win against...,"MILAN: Inter Milan substitute Davide Frattesi struck in added time as the Serie A leaders snatched a 2-1 win against Hellas Verona, who missed a late penalty in a drama filled clash on Saturday.
Inter stretched the gap to five points over second-placed Juventus, which means Simone Inzaghi’s side claim the title of Winter Champions.
Lautaro Martinez had given Inter an early lead before Thomas Henry equalised late in the second half only for Frattesi to put the hosts back in front before Henry missed a last-gasp penalty.
“We did what we had prepared, maybe not always very well, but we take these three points with the awareness that we have Juventus behind us and that we have to continue to win games,” Martinez told Inter TV.
The defeat saw Verona drop into the relegation zone in 18th spot on 14 points.
Inter opened the scoring through Martinez in the 13th minute when Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s pass found the Argentine forward in the box ahead of defender Josh Doig and he calmly shot low past goalkeeper Lorenzo Montipo into the corner.
Martinez had missed the last two games through injury, and his 16th league goal in 17 games sees him well ahead in the Serie A scoring charts, with Sassuolo’s Domenico Berardi his closest challenger on nine goals.
Martinez did have the ball in the net three minutes after the break but offside was given against Francesco Acerbi.
Instead, it was Verona who equalised in the 74th when Henry, who had only been on the pitch for a minute, got a touch with his knee to Ondrej Duda’s cross to beat keeper Yann Sommer.
Marko Arnautovic was guilty of missing two chances to restore Inter’s lead and it looked as if they would have to settle for their second consecutive draw.
But added time brought plenty of drama as Alessandro Bastoni’s volley hit the crossbar and after Nicolo Barella’s follow-up shot from distance was parried by Montipo, substitute Frattesi pounced to score in the 93rd minute.
Before the restart Verona were down to 10-men when Darko Lazovic was shown a red card for saying something to the referee but the visitors still had a chance to equalise with a penalty.
A foul by Matteo Darmian gave Henry the opportunity to net his second but a scuffed spot kick hit the post and Inter held on for the win as Michael Folorunsho headed the rebound wide.
“I watched it, and we should have been better there too,” Inter manager Simone Inzaghi said.  “On the rebound it should not be Folorunsho but us. We were lucky ... he wasn’t supposed to arrive but some Inter players after Henry’s kick.”
Elsewhere, Fiorentina fell to a 1-0 defeat at Sassuolo who snapped a six-match  winless run in all competitions thanks to Andrea Pinamonti’s  ninth-minute strike.
Vincenzo Italiano’s Fiorentina stay in the  Champions League positions, one point ahead of fifth-placed Bologna who  snatched a late draw at Genoa on Friday night.
Sassuolo move up to 14th, five points ahead of Verona  thanks to the win, ahead on goal difference from Frosinone who lost 3-2  an entertaining home clash with Monza.

2,"Atletico, Real win to advance to Copa last 16, Betis knocked out","ARANDA DUERO: Real Madrid cruised into the last 16 of the Copa del Rey with a 3-1 win over Arandina on Saturday,...","ARANDA DUERO: Real Madrid cruised into the last 16 of the Copa del Rey with a 3-1 win over Arandina on Saturday, while Atletico Madrid progressed after a 3-1 victory away to third-tier Lugo courtesy of a second-half double from Memphis Depay and Angel Correa’s early goal.
Fourth-division hosts Arandina did not shrink from the challenge of facing the defending champions, who failed to capitalise on first-half opportunities and found it hard to get past goalkeeper Adrian Alvarez.
Real opened the scoring in the 54th minute through Joselu from the penalty spot after a foul on Brahim Diaz, who extended the visitors’ lead a minute later.
Carlo Ancelotti’s side have struggled with injuries but put in some solid performances, including the debut of Arda Guler, who played for the first time after recovering from several injuries following his summer signing.
Guler came closer than anyone to scoring in the first half, striking  the post with a rasping free-kick and playing with freedom to roam.
“We have to be patient with him, and his quality was on show in the first half,” Ancelotti told reporters.“He has to improve his phyisque and intensity, he has personality and character.” 
A stoppage-time strike from Brazilian forward Rodrygo sealed the win for Real, before Arandina pulled one back through an own goal by Nacho.
Meanwhile, Atletico seemed to be in for a smooth game as well, taking the lead away at Lugo after two minutes when Angel Correa easily slotted home from Javi Galan’s left-wing pass.
Lugo then mounted a resilient display as Leandro Antonetti seized on their opponents’ sloppy defending to equalise in the 39th minute.
Dutch international Depay, however, restored Atletico’s lead in the 66th minute from Koke’s through ball before sealing the win with his second of the night just eight minutes later.
“The team came out well after the break and in general had a good second half and were fair winners,” Atletico manager Diego Simeone told reporters.
In the night’s other fixtures, La Liga’s lowly Alaves stunned Real Betis 1-0 at a rainy Mendizorroza Stadium courtesy of Carlos Benavidez’s goal in the 57th minute to knock out the visitors, who were the cup champions in 2022.
It was Betis’ first cup defeat in regular time since 2019.
Girona progressed with a 2-0 win over Elche thanks to a first-half goal from Daley Blind from a corner kick by Portu, who then assisted Yan Couto to extend the lead in the second half.
Getafe’s Luis Milla scored in the 87th minute to earn the visitors a hard-fought 1-0 win at second-tier Espanyol to reach the round-of-16, while Rayo Vayecano took until the final seconds of extra time to beat Huesca 2-0 with goals from Oscar Valentin and Isi Palazon.
The round-of-16 matches will be played on Jan 17.

3,Foden double fires holders City into FA Cup fourth round,"“We are incredibly delighted to have him [Kevin De Bruyne] back [...] It is so important to have him back after a long injury,” says Guardiola.","MANCHESTER: Phil Foden scored twice as holders Manchester City cruised into the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 5-0 win over Huddersfield Town on Sunday, with playmaker Kevin De Bruyne making a welcome return after four months out with a hamstring injury.
Fielding a strong side, City suffered a setback when they lost defender Manuel Akanji to injury early in the first half, but Foden’s superb finishing and De Bruyne’s comeback gave coach Pep Guardiola plenty to be happy about.
Huddersfield, who are hovering just above the relegation zone in England’s second-tier Championship, fell behind in the 33rd minute when Foden rifled the ball into the net from a tight angle, and striker Julian Alvarez poked home a second four minutes later.
De Bruyne entered the fray in the 57th minute and City added their third a minute later as Norwegian winger Oscar Bobb tried to pick out the Belgian at the far post, only to see his deflected cross loop into the net to make it 3-0.
Foden added his second with a precise shot from the edge of the area in the 65th minute, and nine minutes later De Bruyne teed up fellow substitute Jeremy Doku to complete the rout.
“We are incredibly delighted to have him back, because Kevin helps to win games. It is so important to have him back after a long injury,” Guardiola told the BBC.
“He will help us with his talent but I don’t want to put all the pressure on Kevin’s shoulders because it is not fair to him […] he had a really good assist for the Jeremy Doku goal,” he added.
Goalscorer Foden gave credit to Huddersfield for making it difficult, but ultimately City’s class told.
“We seem to come against a low block quite often - we know what to expect, we just need to be patient, find the spaces and keep switching and hopefully theyll open up and get tired,” he said.
Elsewhere, City’s Premier League rivals struggled as the lower-tier clubs made their presence felt in the cup competition to force some potentially lucrative replays.
Premier League strugglers Luton Town were held 0-0 by third tier Bolton Wanderers at Kenilworth Road.
In their first top-flight campaign since 1992, Luton’s primary goal is survival and a draining replay was the last thing Hatters boss Rob Edwards needed.
Nottingham Forest were also given a scare by League One opponents as Nuno Espirito Santo’s men recovered from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Blackpool.
Blackpool beat Forest in the third round last year when the Seasiders were in the Championship and almost repeated the trick at the City Ground.
Forest academy graduate Jordan Lawrence-Gabriel netted against his old club with a spectacular diving header in the 25th minute Albie Morgan doubled Blackpool’s lead in the 27th minute, coolly converting C.J. Hamilton’s cross at the far post.
But Nicolas Dominguez finished off Gonzalo Montiel’s cross in the 39th minute and Morgan Gibbs-White equalised from 18 yards in the 56th minute.
West Ham United were held to a 1-1 draw against second tier Bristol City at the London Stadium.
Jarrod Bowen ran onto Lucas Paqueta’s lofted pass and slotted home in the fifth minute.
But influential playmaker Paqueta was forced off with an injury midway through the first half in a major blow.
And Tommy Conway sent 9,000 travelling Bristol fans wild in the 61st minute when he fired the equaliser past Lukasz Fabianski.
Leeds United had no such problems as striker Patrick Bamford netted a brilliant volley in a 3-0 hammering of Peterborough United, and West Bromwich Albion cruised to a 4-1 win at home to Aldershot Town.
On Saturday, Aston Villa went through to the fourth round for the first time in eight years with a 1-0 victory away at Middlesbrough thanks to a last-gasp goal by Matty Cash, while Armando Broja set Chelsea on their way to a 4-0 home win over Championship side Preston North End.
Premier League Bournemouth found themselves 2-0 down at second-tier Queens Park Rangers but hit back to win 3-2 at Loftus Road while there were also wins for top-flight sides Brighton and Hove Albion and Sheffield United.
Villa, who are second in the crowded Premier League title race, and Middlesbrough appeared destined for a replay until Cash broke the deadlock in the 87th minute with a powerful shot from just outside the 18-yard box that deflected in off Emmanuel Latte Lath.
“A goal is a goal, so I am buzzing with it,” the defender told the BBC. “I have worked on it in training outside the box to finish, we have worked on having three around the edge and my instinct was to shoot.”
At Stamford Bridge, inconsistent Chelsea dismissed Preston with three goals in 11 second half minutes.
Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino has urged his players to use the FA Cup as a route into Europe given their dismal form in the Premier League.
Heeding that message, Broja headed home to break Preston’s resistance in the 58th minute before Thiago Silva, just off the bench, powered in a header from a Cole Palmer corner in the 66th.
Raheem Sterling curled in a free kick and five minutes from time Enzo Fernandez turned the ball into an empty net to complete the rout.
“We started so sloppy. I told the players at half-time we needed to increase the energy and match that of Preston. The second half was a completely different game,” Pochettino said.
Two goals in quick succession by Sinclair Armstrong and Lyndon Dykes had Championship strugglers QPR in charge against in-form Bournemouth but the visitors found another gear in the second half with substitute Justin Kluivert firing the winner after Marcus Tavernier and Kieffer Moore had levelled it up.
Inspired by Joao Pedro’s double, Brighton won 4-2 at Championship outfit Stoke City despite falling behind early on.
Sheffield, bottom of the Premier League, cruised to a 4-0 victory at fourth tier Gillingham with William Osula and James McAtee both scoring twice in a 4-0 victory.
Coventry City thrashed Oxford United 6-2 to reach the fourth round for the first time in five years.

4,Zverev-led Germany beat Swiatek’s Poland to clinch United Cup,SYDNEY: Alexander Zverev saved two match points in a gruelling three-set win over Hubert Hurkacz to help Germany...,"SYDNEY: Alexander Zverev saved two match points in a gruelling three-set win over Hubert Hurkacz to help Germany upset top seeds Poland and clinch a maiden United Cup title in Sydney on Sunday.
The world number seven kept the tie alive with his never-say-die 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (8/6), 6-4 victory after top-ranked Iga Swiatek had swept past Angelique Kerber 6-3, 6-0.
Zverev returned to partner Laura Siegemund and seal the title with a 6-4, 5-7, 10-4 win over Swiatek and Hurkacz in the deciding mixed doubles.
“It was a matter of millimetres today for you guys [Poland] to be the champions,” Zverev said at the presentation ceremony. “To my team, it’s been amazing and so much fun. I couldn’t be happier.”
Hurkacz and Zverev had not met since the 2021 ATP Finals, where the German was eventually crowned champion.
Both 26 years old and big servers, there were only small margins between them in the singles clash, with Hurkacz rising to the challenge in the first set tiebreak.
It went the distance again in the second set after the Pole saved two set points from Zverev at 5-6.
But this time, he lost his nerve in the tiebreak and blew two championship points as Zverev took it to a deciding set despite showing signs of fatigue.
With errors creeping in to Hurkacz’s game, Zverev broke for a 4-3 lead in the third and, overcoming a bout of cramps, found a way to win.
“I was exhausted,” said Zverev, with Germany’s semi-final not finishing until 2.18am on Sunday.
“In the middle of the second set I was already exhausted and in the third set I was hanging on a lot of the time and somehow got the break,” he added.
“Obviously mentally and physically, it was extremely difficult because playing three days in a row singles and mixed is tough.”
Swiatek is in imperious touch heading into the Australian Open, dropping just one set throughout the mixed teams tournament to be on a 16-match win streak that began with her runs through Beijing and Cancun to end last season.
She was on another level to former world number one Kerber, who is on the comeback from an 18-month maternity layoff, winning the last nine games in a row.
“I feel like I just really improved during the pre-season and I’m happy that I played such solid matches here,” said the 22-year-old. “I’m really proud of myself that I could win all of my singles.
“I felt like she was really picking the right spots to play and she surprised me sometimes with her decision-making and choices,” she added of Kerber.
“I knew she could play like that but I didn’t have much time to get into the rhythm because sometimes she was really aiming these balls inside out.
“With the ball change, I felt like my game could be more dynamic and I could push Angelique more after 4-3 [in the first set].”
Kerber put early pressure on Swiatek, who saved two break points to hold for 3-2.
But the match turned when the Pole overpowered Kerber’s serve to break for 5-3 and it was a demolition job from then on as Swiatek ran riot.
She will head to the Australian Open with wins over Caroline Garcia, Beatriz Haddad Maia, Sara Sorribes Tormo and Zheng Qinwen, along with Kerber.

5,‘Khawaja’s appeal against ICC sanction rejected’,MELBOURNE: Australian opener Usman Khawaja suffered a setback after his appeal against the sanction imposed on him...,"MELBOURNE: Australian opener Usman Khawaja suffered a setback after his appeal against the sanction imposed on him for wearing a black armband during the opening Test against Pakistan was rejected by the International Cricket Council, a report said on Sunday.
Last month, Khawaja was reprimanded by the ICC for wearing the black armband to mourn the children who have been the victim of the conflict between Israel and Palestine that has been going on since October last year.
The 37-year-old, who was born in Pakistan and is the first Muslim to play Test cricket for Australia, had challenged the reprimand saying that the armband was for a personal bereavement.
However, a report in Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday said that “Usman Khawaja’s reprimand for wearing a black armband onto the field during the first Test against Pakistan in Perth will stand after the International Cricket Council rejected his appeal against the sanction…”
It was “according to a source close to the situation who wished to remain anonymous ahead of any public announcement being made”.
ICC regulations prevent cricketers from displaying messages of political, religious or racial causes during international matches.
However, players can wear black armbands to mark deaths of former players, family members or other significant individuals after taking prior permission from the governing body.
ICC had said that Khawaja did not take required permission from his Cricket Australia or the ICC.
Khawaja had also arrived for a training session on 13 December with “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right” inscribed on his batting spikes and had reportedly planned to wear them during the inaugural Test.
Khawaja also denied that he had “any hidden agendas” when he arrived for a training session with inscriptions on his batting spikes, apparently in reference to the war in Gaza.

6,Nadal to skip Australian Open due to fresh muscle injury,"“During my last match in Brisbane I had a small problem on a muscle that as you know made me worried,” says Nadal.","MELBOURNE: Rafael Nadal will miss the Australian Open this month after the Spaniard suffered a small muscle tear during his comeback from a long injury layoff at the Brisbane International last week, the 22-time Grand Slam champion said on Sunday.
Nadal’s latest injury casts fresh doubts about the former world number one’s ability to compete at the elite level again after he previously said that he expects to finish his glittering but injury-plagued career in 2024.
He made his long-awaited return to competitive tennis in Brisbane after spending almost a year out on the sidelines with a hip flexor injury sustained during his second round defeat to Mackenzie McDonald in last year’s Australian Open.
The 37-year-old did not compete again last season after undergoing surgery in June and suffered an upper left leg issue during his defeat by Jordan Thompson in the quarter-finals of the tune-up event for the Jan. 14-28 Melbourne Park major.
“During my last match in Brisbane I had a small problem on a muscle that as you know made me worried,” Nadal said in a statement on X.
 






“Once I got to Melbourne I have had the chance to make an MRI and I have micro tear on a muscle, not in the same part where I had the injury and that’s good news.
“Right now I am not ready to compete at the maximum level of exigence in five sets matches. I’m flying back to Spain to see my doctor, get some treatment and rest.”
Nadal, who won the Australian Open in 2009 and 2022, said he had worked extremely hard to make his comeback during the year and stressed that despite the latest setback his goal was to be at his best in three months.
“We will miss you in Melbourne, Rafa,” the Australian Open said on its official X feed.  “Sending all our love and best wishes for a speedy recovery. See you on the court soon.”
Nadal also said in an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais recently that he was thinking about the French Open, where he has won 14 of his major titles.
“Within the sad news for me for not being able to play in front of the amazing Melbourne crowds, this isn’t very bad news and we all remain positive with the evolution for the season,” Nadal added.
“I really wanted to play here in Australia and I have had the chance to play a few matches that made me very happy and positive.”

7,Ahmed Shehzad still hopeful of return to Pakistan team,"QUETTA: Former Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad is still hopeful of making a comeback to the national team.

Speaking ...","QUETTA: Former Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad is still hopeful of making a comeback to the national team.
Speaking at a news conference here on Sunday, where he announced plans of establishing a cricket academy in Quetta, Ahmed said there were no excuses for Pakistan’s poor performance in their Test series whitewash against Australia.
“It is very unfortunate; once again we lost to Australia,” the 32-year-old, who played his last Test in 2017, told reporters.
“The senior  players should have shown their performance. There is no excuse for  defeat. The mistakes must be eliminated as soon as possible. I will make a  comeback in the national team soon.”
Ahmed last featured in a One-day International for Pakistan back in October 2017 while his last T20 International appearance came in October 2019.
Since then, there has been no way back for him in the national team set up and he also went unpicked during the recent draft for the upcoming season of the Pakistan Super League.
Ahmed, who was part of the Quetta Gladiators side which won the PSL in 2019, said he hoped his academy would help nurture the talent in the province which could one day represent Pakistan at the international stage. 
“There is no dearth of talented cricketers in Balochistan ... all they need is encouragement, training and opportunities,” said Ahmed, sitting alongside Balochistan Minister for Information Jan Achakzai.
“When Quetta Gladiators won the PSL, the people of Quetta gave us a lot of love and I was determined to do whatever I could in life for the youth of Quetta.”

8,Rohit returns to skipper India T20 side against Afghanistan,Kohli also returns to the shorter format's side as the pair looks to make their comeback after India's loss to England in 2022.,"NEW DELHI: India’s Rohit Sharma will skipper the upcoming three-match T20I series against Afghanistan, fresh from celebrating the quickest win in Test history in South Africa, India’s cricket board said on Sunday.
Earlier in January, Rohit led India to thrash South Africa by seven wickets in the second Test, a match which took only 107 overs and was completed on the second afternoon.
Sharma now returns to lead his team in the T20 format, alongside key player Virat Kohli.
Both last played a T20I in November 2022, when India lost to England in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in Australia.
The 2024 T20 World Cup takes place in the West Indies and the US in June.
The three-match T20 series opens in Mohali on January 11, followed by Indore on January 14 and Bengaluru on January 17, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said.
Squad: Rohit Sharma (capt), Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Ravi Bishnoi, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar

DHAKA: Bangladeshi cricket captain Shakib Al Hasan won a seat in the country’s parliament on Sunday after a landslide victory in a general election boycotted by the opposition, an official said.
The 36-year all-rounder, who leads the country in all formats of the game, beat his rival by a margin of more than 150,000 votes in his constituency in the western town of Magura, the district’s chief administrator Abu Naser Beg said.
“It was a landslide victory,” he said.
There is no immediate comment from the cricketer, a candidate of the ruling Awami League party of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is herself widely expected to win a fifth term in power after the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted the vote.
Shakib, speaking ahead of the election, conceded he was not facing any serious obstacle but told AFP the contest still made him anxious.
“The competition and challenges are always there, be it a small team or big team,” he said.
Shakib’s campaign obliged him to take a temporary leave of absence from cricket.
He has bristled at the suggestion he would not be able to balance his duties as a lawmaker and a cricket captain.
“Did I retire?” he asked during campaigning.  “If I haven’t retired, then where does this question come from?”
Shakib is the only person to have been ranked the number-one all-rounder in all three formats simultaneously by the International Cricket Council.
He was a teenager when he was recruited to the country’s premier sports academy and just 19 at his international debut in 2006 as a batting all-rounder.
By the following year, he was already a star when he hit a fifty in a David-and-Goliath show against India in the World Cup — a victory still spoken of reverentially by Bangladeshi fans.
He has also garnered a reputation for ill-discipline, with a rebellious streak that once saw him threaten a spectator with a bat, and that earned him a three-match ban after making a lewd gesture to a television crew.

Only nine-time rally world champion Sebastien Loeb got anywhere near Peter­hansel at 29sec as American rookie Seth Quintero came home third at 3min 11sec.
The 58-year-old Peterhansel scooped his 50th Dakar Rally stage win to become joint record holder with Ari Vatanen.
“I stopped counting a long time ago, but it’s good to know I can still beat him,” Peterhansel said.
But the result leaves Audi’s Carlos Sainz in the overall lead at 8hr 49min 38sec with a lead of 1min 51sec on Saudi Arabian Yazeed Al Rajhi who came fifth Sunday, while Loeb sits third at 4min 17sec.
Defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah was fourth on the day at 6min 28.
In the motorbike section Honda’s Ignacio Cornejo took the win with a lead of 5min 59sec ahead of Luciano Benavides while Botswana’s Ross Branch remains in the overall lead.

Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov hits a return to Holger Rune of Denmark during the final of the Brisbane International on Sunday.—AFP

 
BRISBANE: Elena Rybakina handed Aryna Sabalenka a harsh reality check on Sunday ahead of her Australian Open title defence with a crushing 6-0, 6-3 victory in the final of the Brisbane International.
The men’s final that followed on Pat Rafter Arena was a much tighter contest with former world number three Grigor Dimitrov claiming his first ATP title in more than six years with a 7-6(5), 6-4 victory over Danish young gun Holger Rune.
World number two Sabalenka came into the women’s final, a rematch of last year’s Melbourne title-decider, on a 15-match winning streak in Australia but was completely outplayed by former Wimbledon champion Rybakina.
The relentless Kazakh wrapped up the first set in 24 minutes on the back of three breaks of serve as Sabalenka, shaking her head at herself in disbelief, sprayed 12 unforced errors across the Queensland Tennis Centre showcourt.
Rybakina broke Sabalenka again to start the second set and, although there was more fight from the other side of the net, sealed her sixth career title when the Belarussian crashed another forehand wide.
“I want to congratulate Aryna on a great week and a great season last year and hopefully we will meet again in Melbourne,” the Moscow-born world number four said in the on-court presentation ceremony.
“Despite the score, it’s always tough to play you. We push each other, which is great, and we improve in this way so I hope that continues.”
The pair split their four meetings last year with two wins apiece, although Sabalenka won the match that mattered most to claim her first Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park.
“Honestly, I don’t know where to start,” said a laughing Sabalenka.  “Elena, wow, I don’t know where to start. Thank you for those three games, at least we made it look like a fight.
“Couple of words to my team, you did a bad job today. 6-0, 6-3, that’s all your fault guys... Hopefully we’ll be better at the Australia Open.”
In the men’s final, Dimitrov’s experience and court craft won out over Rune’s youthful athleticism in the men’s final, an engrossing contest with plenty of high quality tennis that kept the crowd gripped for more than two hours.
The 32-year-old Bulgarian, whose game was once compared to that of Roger Federer, clinched a tight first in the tiebreak but world number eight Rune would not back down.
The Dane, who regularly found aces to get himself out of trouble, fought off a break in a 17-minute game early in the second set and saved three championship points to hold for 4-5.
Dimitrov served out to love, however, claiming the ninth title of his career, and a first since he won the ATP Tour finals in London back in Nov. 2017, with a beautifully judged backhand at the net.
“It’s been a while since I held one of these,” an emotional Dimitrov said after receiving the trophy for the second time after his 2017 Brisbane triumph.
“I’m fairly tired and I’ll take a few days off but I’m really happy to be in Australia. I’ll keep on going and yeah, onto the next one.”
The year’s first Grand Slam begins next Sunday and runs to Jan 28.

Gauff, who burst onto the scene at Wimbledon five years ago, enjoyed a stellar 2023 as the 19-year-old American won her first major trophy at the US Open in September to reach a career-high world ranking of number three.
The Auckland top seed continued to build momentum in the new season by winning the tune-up for the Jan 14-28 Australian Open, losing only one set after a thorough test in the final by twice Melbourne Park quarter-finalist Svitolina.
“This is my first time ever having to defend a title, so I’m really happy I was able to do it today,” said Gauff, who claimed her seventh career WTA singles trophy. “This year’s tournament was a lot different,” she added, thanking the boisterous crowd.
“Last year it rained almost every single match and we were playing indoors with just a few people watching so it’s really cool to play in front of a packed crowd almost every match.”
Both players dropped serve twice in the opening set before Gauff’s level dipped slightly as she squandered two set points at 5-3 to allow the big-hitting Svitolina to claw her way back and take the early lead in the match via the tie-break.
But Gauff responded strongly to breeze through the next set and level the contest at one set apiece, and held her nerve after grabbing the crucial break in the eighth game of the decider to close out the victory.
“It’s been a really great experience to play for the first time here,” said Ukraine’s second seed Svitolina, who returned to the tour last April following the birth of her daughter with fellow tennis player Gael Monfils. “I want to congratulate Coco and her team for a great start to the year. Good luck at the Australian Open.

13,Brazil says goodbye to late football great Zagallo,"RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazilians paid their last respects Sunday to football legend Mario Zagallo, after the four-time...","RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazilians paid their last respects Sunday to football legend Mario Zagallo, after the four-time World Cup-winning player and coach died at age 92, the final member of one of the country’s greatest footballing generations.
Dressed in black, the yellow of the Brazilian national team or the colors of the clubs where Zagallo played and coached, scores of mourners filed past his coffin at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) in Rio de Janeiro.
Also on display near the lace-draped coffin were football-mad Brazil’s record five World Cup trophies.
Zagallo, a diminutive left-wing known for his tactical brilliance, had a hand in winning four of them, more than anyone in football history.
The  “Professor,” as he was known, played alongside Pele in Brazil’s 1958 and 1962 World Cup-winning teams.
He then went on to coach the 1970 world champion side starring Pele — considered by many the greatest team in history — and serve as assistant coach when the  “Selecao” repeated the feat in 1994.
“He made football history. It’s a tremendous loss,” said Eduardo Bandeira de Mello, former president of famed club Flamengo, where Zagallo was both a player and manager. “What he did with the national team in 1970 should be an inspiration to every coach.”
Zagallo died Friday of multiple organ failure at a Rio hospital, after suffering a series of health problems in recent months.
The public wake will be followed by a private mass, then a burial at the Sao Joao Batista cemetery, the final resting place of some of Brazil’s most famous citizens.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who called Zagallo  “one of the greatest football players and coaches of all time,” declared three days of national mourning from Saturday, ordering flags flown at half-mast across Brazil.
Tributes have also poured in from the football world.
FIFA president Gianni Infantino said Zagallo’s influence on football was  “supreme,” World Cup winners Ronaldinho, Romario and Cafu paid homage, and current Brazil and Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior simply called him  “LEGEND.”
The only other men to win the World Cup as both player and coach are Franz Beckenbauer of Germany (1974 and 1990) and Didier Deschamps of France (1998 and 2018).

In the final, lasting an hour and 18 minutes, the 22-year-old Shoaib rode on a fast start by breaking Aqeel’s first game to take a 4-2 lead and kept up the intensity to take the first set.
Aqeel tried to come back in the second set but Shoaib continued to play from the baseline, breaking his much experienced opponent in the seventh game before clinching it with an ace.
The ladies final was a more closely-contested affair with Sarah Mehboob overcoming Amna Ali Qayyum 6-4, 7-5.
In the Boys & Girls’ Under-10 final, Mohammad Arsh defeated Mohammad Faizan 4-2, 4-1.

With Aftab Choudhry in the saddle, Dila Awaiz — owned by Hashim Ali Dogar and trained by Sohail Aziz — powered to an upset victory, clocking one minute and 25 seconds for the 1400 metrers race. 
Dila Awaiz beat bay filly Verde One by four lengths while another bay filly Golden Market ended third. The 70 to 100 favourite colt Bambino put up a dismal show, edging the frame under veteran jockey Aamir Pervez. 
The main supporting event, the January Cup run over 1400 metres was won by the rank outsider colt Samson, trained by Sohail Aziz and ridden by jockey Bilal Ahmad.
