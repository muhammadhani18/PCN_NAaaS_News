0,Bahawalnagar plagued by rising crime,Complaints surge as police inaction raises concerns,"In the wake of the new year, Bahawalnagar is witnessing an alarming surge in street crimes, leaving residents grappling with increased incidents of muggings and robberies.
Disturbingly, the police seem powerless to curb the escalating menace, leading to growing public discomfort and a surge in citizen complaints.
In a recent string of robberies, a police security officer's residence was targeted, raising questions about the efficacy of law enforcement in the region.
The officer, Umair Nazir, stationed at the DPO office, fell victim to a harrowing incident where five armed bandits seized gold jewellery worth over Rs2.2 million, cash, prize bonds, mobile phones, and even the officer's personal pistol and wireless set.
The FIR for this incident was lodged after a 24-hour delay, further eroding public trust in the authorities.
The brazenness of the criminals was evident as they broke into the officer's house, holding the family at gunpoint, and looted valuables before making a swift escape.
The incident has not only highlighted the vulnerability of the public but has also cast doubts on the police's credibility.

In another incident near the Dhaban area of Saddar police station, two bandits set up barricades and robbed ten victims of thousands of rupees.
Travellers named Imran and Rab Nawaz, were targeted by the bandits while en route to the vegetable market, recounting the ordeal of being robbed at gunpoint.
A separate incident unfolded within the jurisdiction of the Minchinabad police station, where two robbers targeted a Lahore’s resident, making off with Rs125,000.
Abdullah, the victim, faced the unfortunate incident while returning after attending an event.
In yet another incident under the Saddar Haroonabad police station, six to seven bandits forcefully entered the house of a landlord named Maqbool.

The family was subjected to a terrifying ordeal as the robbers, armed and menacing, ransacked the rooms for hours, taking away seven tolas of gold jewellery and cash amounting to Rs1,672,000.
Tragically, violence erupted in the fifth incident when four bandits attempted to rob Kaleemullah.
The resistance from Kaleem led to a confrontation, resulting in him being shot in the left thigh by one of the robbers wielding a pistol.
The spate of criminal activities has prompted the police to initiate separate investigations into all the incidents. However, concerns about the district police's efficacy persist, with rising complaints and a weak grip on law and order. During the 90-day period, the district police received over 1,500 complaints, indicating a growing dissatisfaction among the public.
In a startling revelation during an online open court session, a complainant from Tehsil Chishtian accused each DPO appointed by political figures of receiving a hefty amount of Rs2.5 million.
Despite mounting complaints and allegations, the DPO neither took action nor refuted the salary claims in the online open court.
The appointment of a specific SHO at Saddar police station is identified as a contributing factor to the deteriorating law and order situation in Bahawalnagar.

1,Multan’s citizens embrace harsh winter,"Fish vendors swimming in business, theatres floundering","In the midst of the biting cold weather, the sale of fish has witnessed a notable surge in the city, with a multitude of temporary shops springing up to meet increased demand. The popularity of fish has soared, attributed to its perceived suitability for extreme weather conditions.
Temporary stalls offering a wide array of fresh fish have become a common sight across the city, including in the fish market, MDA Chowk, Pul Bararan and many other areas.
Among the options available, larger fish are being priced at Rs600 per kilogram, while smaller varieties are selling at the slightly lower rate of Rs550 per kilogram. Fish has become the go-to dish amid the prevailing harsh weather, providing not only taste but also a source of warmth and comfort.
Read  Winter brings boom to fish sales
Medical experts have endorsed the consumption of fish during cold weather. They highlight its benefits in maintaining body temperature, making it a healthy and warming choice for individuals looking to stay resilient against the cold.
The surge in fish sales provides a welcome economic boost for vendors trying to make the most of the prevailing weather. Muhammad Bilal, a shopkeeper at Faiz-e-Aam Chowk, expressed pleasure and said that is his income increased manifold over the last few days.

Entertainment industry freezes over
Meanwhile, the adverse weather has led to a decline in citizens’ outdoor activities, as a decrease in the number of theatre-goers has been observed and both theatre owners and artists are facing financial issues. The extreme weather impacted the movement of citizens not only in Multan but also in Vehari, Lodhran and other areas.
With five popular theatres in the city able to seat 2,000 visitors, the reduced turnout has raised concerns. Poor conditions have not only affected citizens’ willingness to venture out, but have also financially impacted the entertainment industry. Producers have been compelled to suspend shows nearly thrice a week. This interruption in regular schedules has not only impacted revenue streams but has also affected the livelihoods of artists.
Furthermore, the health of some artists has been compromised with instances of illness, particularly flu-related, prompting them to refrain from working.

2,Shady sellers : Flea markets circulating stolen gadgets,"Laptops, smartphones sold at unreasonably low prices are usually procured through illegal means","Even though the availability of cheap laptops and smart phones is nothing short of a blessing for low-income students and professionals seeking affordable connectivity devices for vocational purposes, the large-scale sale of stolen gadgets in flea markets across the provincial capital has drastically raised the stakes of making a second-hand purchase.
In Lahore, flea markets have always been a popular sight across many areas in the city, where make-shift stalls are setup every Friday and Sunday, offering a variety of food items, household necessities and even electronic gadgets at substantially reduced prices to low-income groups facing budget constraints.
In recent times however, multiple flea markets located in old areas like the Container Market and Hall Road have gained notoriety for selling and buying stolen laptops and smartphones with altered International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, which risk landing the involved parties in legal trouble in case they are caught.
Read  Citizens rush for affordable winter clothes
“Every day two or three incidents involving the sale of a stolen mobile phone with a tampered IMEI are reported in our market,” shared Javed Iqbal, a businessman from the Hall Road Market, who further claimed that traders tried their best to investigate the legality of the sold items through the e-gadget yet so many cases were arising.
“Even though some cunning thieves are clever enough not to bring stolen items for trade, some who do have either bought the stolen mobile from someone they know in ignorance or from an unknown dealer at a footpath or the Sunday Bazaar,” concurred Haji Ashraf, another shopkeeper.
Other traders at the Hall Road also claimed that earlier several illegal Afghan businessmen were involved in the sale of stolen mobile phones and laptops and the police would occasionally crackdown against them.

According to the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA), almost 29.56 million stolen mobiles were identified with duplicated IMEIs in 2022 through the mobile device authentication, registration, and blocking system (DIRBS).
Sellers like Dost Mohammad Khan however, deny the claims that flea markets were circulating stolen goods. “I import laptops from different countries through the Iran border and keep them stored in warehouses in Lahore. I give all my customers a one month warrantee,” assured Khan, who sells laptops at the Sunday Bazaar.
Unsure of Khan’s claims, Mohammad Taha, a young man spotted purchasing laptops at the market revealed that he had already bought three or four laptops from here purely because of their convenience and affordability. “So far, my experience has been very good. The laptops available here are much cheaper than the normal market price and the variety is also greater,” said Taha.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the sale of stolen gadgets, a spokesman of the Punjab Police said, “Since 2019, it is mandatory for all those involved in the purchase and repair of mobile phones to register themselves with the app called e-Gadget Monitoring System. The registered shopkeepers are obliged to store the identity information of all the people coming for sale or repair of their mobiles, including their IMEI numbers. There has been a significant decrease in the incidents of snatching mobile phones ever since this app has come into use.”

3,Working women still hamstrung,Concerns abound over lack of oversight in hostels,"In cities across Punjab, the most pressing challenge faced by women working away from home revolves around securing suitable accommodation.
While the government introduced the Working Women's Hostel Authority to address this issue, it remains inactive, leaving women vulnerable to various facility-related problems.
Dr Warda Gul, a Haripur Hazara native, has been living in Lahore for years due to her education and job. Despite her government employment, she resides in a private hostel in Shadman, as her attempts to secure space in a government hostel proved futile.
Facing challenges in her previous hostel during the 2019 pandemic, Gul now pays Rs25,000 per month in her current private hostel. While noting improved security, she acknowledges the downsides of small rooms and unsanitary washrooms.
Syeda Batul Fatima, originally from Layyah, resides in a government working women's hostel in Lahore. Being the daughter of an additional secretary facilitated her accommodation in the government hostel. However, the facilities, mirroring those in government institutions, raise concerns, especially regarding cleanliness in washrooms.

The presence of a mess committee doesn't alleviate the situation, as women often resort to ordering food due to varying work schedules.
Despite the absence of an official record, hundreds of private hostels operate in Punjab, each with its own regulations and rental policies.
Mazahir Shagri, operating a private hostel in Lahore, points out the challenges faced by operators, such as varying rent structures and the absence of regulatory bodies. The lack of oversight results in administrators maintaining their own records, leading to undue demands for money during inspections.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, the Women's Welfare Department Secretary Sumaira Samad revealed that there were currently 16 working women's hostels in Punjab, ensuring 625 beds.
“Plans are underway to establish hostels in all districts, with a budget allocation expected in the next financial year for the Women's Hostels Authority,” she said.
Samad emphasised that any working woman can stay in the hostels, irrespective of government employment. While current rents are low, there are plans to review and potentially increase them.

The Women's Welfare Department outlined four room categories with varying rents, with big cities like Lahore having higher rates.
The recently approved Punjab Women Hostels Authority Act of 2023 aims to address these challenges, outlining the composition of the authority and its objectives. However, the establishment faces delays due to the caretaker government, with expectations of activation post-elections.
As the demand for suitable accommodation persists, the effectiveness of the Women's Hostels Authority becomes crucial in ensuring safe and adequate living conditions for working women across Punjab.
Rent details from the Women's Welfare Department indicate that a single room in Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, and Multan costs Rs1500 a month while a double room costs Rs1,000 per person.

Three and four-bedroom rents are Rs800 per person. All residents pay electricity and gas bills separately, with a refundable security deposit of Rs5,000 in big cities and Rs4,000 in small cities.
The Punjab Women Hostels Authority Act, approved in February 2023, aims to establish an authority overseeing the sector. However, its activation faces delays due to the caretaker government. The act outlines the authority's composition, including ex-officio members and representatives from various sectors.
While the caretaker government's absence of a Women Development Department Minister delays the authority's establishment, there is optimism for its functionality post-elections.
The establishment of the Punjab Working Women Hostels Authority is seen as a crucial step in bringing hostels under a legal framework and formulating necessary rules and regulations for their effective operation.

4,Visitors flock to Bhagat Singh’s village,Residents voluntarily maintain family home of freedom movement hero,"Bhagat Singh’s family home in Bangay village is being maintained without government patronage as no department has initiated efforts to preserve the monumental Haveli of the subcontinent’s shared hero and freedom fighter who was a great symbol of resistance from the Sandal Bar region.
Bhagat Singh, one of the revolutionaries who participated in the freedom movement, was born to Kishan Singh and Vidiavati at Chak 105GB, Bangay in Jaranwala on September 27, 1907. He got early education from his native village and got associated with the Naujawan Baharat Sabha in 1925. Afterwards, he sought membership of the Hindustan Republic Association and the revolutionary movement led by Lala Lajpat Rai, through which he extended his links with other revolutionaries of to promote an armed struggle against the British Empire.
On the arrival of the Simon Commission in Lahore in 1928, Bhagat Singh, along with dozens of his companions, staged a protest demonstration at the railway station, where an assistant superintendent of police baton charged the demonstrators, severely injuring Lajpat Rai. According to historical accounts, to avenge the police brutality, Bhagat Singh, with the help of Raj guru and Sukhdev, planned to shot dead the police officer and hurl bombs at the legislative assembly. After implementing the plan, he surrendered to the police.

During imprisonment, he observed a hunger strike against excesses of the jail staff against the prisoners, becoming a hero of revolutionaries across the subcontinent.
He was sentenced to death on charge of murdering the police officer and hanged at the age of 24 years on Mar 23, 1930, at Lahore jail. After independence, his family migrated to India and the evacuee property was allotted to Chaudhry Fazal Qader Virk whose heirs look after the Haveli Bhagat Singh.
Saqib Iqbal Virk of Fazal Qader’s family told The Express Tribune that the government had not taken interest in protect the monuments related to Bhagat Singh. Only renovation of the freedom fighter’s primary school had been carried out in 2013.

Virk suggested that the government build a gate at the entrance of the village, a double road and install street lights. He said a higher secondary school should be built and a dispensary with a senior doctor, a park and other facilities should be provided to the residents.
He said hundreds of visitors arrived annually from across the world to pay homage to Bhagat Singh.
Virk said a street or chowk in the village should be named after the hero. He offered to give donation for setting up a library.
He also suggested that a Bhagat Singh chair should be established at universities for research. He said officials of the Walled City authority had visited the village but his family had maintained the premises itself.
