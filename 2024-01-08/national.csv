SOME books do not become old and just keep on getting younger, shining more brightly as they age. Baang-i-Dara, the first collection of Iqbal’s poetic works in Urdu, is one such book. It first appeared in 1924.
Dr Rafi’uddin Hashmi says Iqbal had written “Muhammad Iqbal, September 3, 1924”, on the first copies of Baang-i-Dara that he presented to Mian Nizamuddin and Prof Arnold. Presuming that the book might have arrived from the press on the same day or a day before, we can safely assume that in September this year the book will turn 100.
Books usually vanish within a few years and even popular works die out a few decades after their publication. Only classics and extra-ordinarily exquisite works survive beyond a century since their new editions, too, sell well. Baang-i-Dara is poised to enter the second century of its life as it is still being reprinted and read: till 1979, at least 36 editions of Baang-i-Dara had been published in Pakistan legally, excluding Baang-i-Dara that is invariably a part of dozens of editions of Kulliayat-i-Iqbal (Iqbal’s collected poetic works in Urdu). As the copyright ends 50 years after author’s death, from 1988 every publisher was entitled to reprint Iqbal’s works and it unleashed a deluge of reprints. As a result, Baang-i-Dara, and Iqbal’s other works, have been reprinted for heaven knows how many times. In a country where reading habits have always been described in unflattering terms, these reprints are simply phenomenal, giving the book an eternal seal of approval.
Why has Baang-i-Dara become so popular? Iqbal’s poetry was already hugely popular and during the annual sessions of Anjuman Himayat-i-Islam, held at Lahore, Iqbal not only recited his poems but these were published in pamphlet form — with the intension of collecting funds for the Anjuman — and were sold at premium price. His poems recited at Anjuman’s gatherings would sometimes move the audience to tears. Many of them, such as Tulu-i-Islam and Khizr-i-Raah, are included in Baang-i-Dara. So when Iqbal’s Urdu poetry’s first collection appeared in book form it was naturally a smashing success.
Secondly, many of the poems included in Baang-i-Dara were composed against the backdrop of a peculiar political and cultural milieu, highlighting the plight of the Muslims on the chessboard of international politics. They stressed a need for Islam’s Renaissance. ‘Baang’ means voice or sound and ‘dara’, also pronounced dira, means bell, thus Baang-i-Dara means, literally, the sound of a bell, an allusion to the bell sounded when a caravan prepares for travel. As he has mentioned in his poem Tarana-i-Milli, the call of the bell is Iqbal’s ‘tarana’, or song, signalling the departure of the caravan.
Thirdly, Iqbal’s voice sounded quite unique as it deviated from the traditional love poetry of Urdu yet it was not devoid of the poetic and artistic characteristics. His poetry, embellished and thoughtful, appealed the readers. The components of Iqbal’s art and thought that made him one of the great poets of Urdu, for instance, depiction of nature, nationalistic ideas, poetic expressions and philosophic notions, are very much part of Baang-i-Dara’s contents.
Intriguingly, Iqbal’s Urdu poetry had been collected and published by two scholars even before Iqbal could get Baang-i-Dara published. Both were published without Iqbal’s permission, though without mala fide intentions. The first one, named Iqbal, penned by Ahmed Deen and published from Lahore in 1923 with a copious selection from Iqbal’s verses, was a critical evaluation and appreciation of Iqbal’s works. On Iqbal’s displeasure, Ahmed Deen, a friend, burnt down all the copies, save for few, one of which was later on compiled by Mushfiq Khwaja.
The other unauthorised version of Iqbal’s Urdu poetry was compiled by Abdur Razzaq Rashid and published from Deccan in 1924 under the title Kulliyaat-i-Iqbal, without Iqbal’s permission though. As it was published from Deccan, a princely state where British India government laws were not fully applicable, the legal action against the book was not possible. But with the help of Sir Akber Hyderi, its distribution was restricted to Deccan.
The reason for Iqbal’s annoyance at these books was that he wanted to compile his Urdu poetry collection based on a careful selection and did not deem many of his verses published in magazines and newspapers fit to be included in book form. As a result, he had discarded many of his own verses and they are not part of Baang-i-Dara. Some of these couplets and poems that Iqbal had done away with were later on included in some works by scholars who collected Iqbal’s each and every word from different sources.
So Iqbal lives on and Baang-i-Dara lives on. One hopes relevant faculties at our universities will make arrangement to celebrate 100 years of Baang-i-Dara, making sure that bells are sounded yet again and our youth prepares for travel.

1,"Only May 9 perpetrators, not entire PTI, should face law: PM Kakar","Talks about dealing with party leaders on ""case-to-case"" basis; calls on armed Baloch groups to surrender.","• Talks about dealing with party leaders on ‘case-to-case’ basis
• Calls on armed Baloch groups to surrender; says justice system ‘ineffective’ to handle militancy
ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar said that only those responsible for the May 9 mayhem, and not the entire Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), should be taken to task.
“PTI as a whole should not be treated as responsible for the May 9 riots,” he said in an interview with Geo News, on Sunday.
Asked whether he was sure that PTI founder Imran Khan was directly involved in the May 9 violence, Mr Kakar said he could not give his final opinion on the matter unless it was decided by courts.
“I receive many reports on this, which are sometimes conflicting. Therefore, you cannot make your decision on that basis,” he added.
 


The caretaker premier said there was a need to deal with the PTI leaders on a case-to-case basis so that there was not an impression that something unjustified is being done.
Asked what action has been taken against those military officials who were reportedly taken into custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 violent protests, he said investigations into the matter were still underway and so far there was nothing concrete to unveil.
“When the investigation will be completed, ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations) will share it with people,” he added.
He said those PTI leaders, who were accused of being involved in the May 9 events and were still in hiding, should surrender.
“Their rights will not be established unless they surrender. If they do not surrender they will face hurdles in their political activities,” he added.
The interim PM disclosed that once he was a supporter of PTI and gave his vote to the party in 2013 and 2018 elections because he thought PTI had a team and capability to rid the country of problems. “But now my views have changed as I have realised that they (PTI) don’t have any team or vision to address problems confronting the country,” he said.
In reply to a question whether he had been nominated for the slot of caretaker PM by some hidden powers, Mr Kakar said he was chosen by then-prime minister Shehbaz Sharif with the consent of then-leader of the opposition in the National Assembly Raja Riaz.
“Shehbaz Sharif made me caretaker prime minister and informed me about it,” he added.
Missing persons
About the Balochistan situation and the issue of missing persons, PM Kakar declared that armed struggles cannot be allowed in the province. He said armed organisations active in Balochistan should surrender and the government should take advantage if they did so.
 


Responding to a question about the killing of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Bugti in 2006, he said that was a very complexed issue to decide who were on the wrong and who were on the right side.
“When Bugti was killed, some military officers like a serving major, a subedar and some others also lost their lives. What opinion can I give on this… they (military personnel) were fighting while wearing Pakistani uniform and on the other side people were fighting for their political objectives,” he explained.
He said Brahamdagh Bugti was working to change the geography of Pakistan and wanted an independent Balochistan and for this he justified his armed struggle while his brother Shahzain Bugti wanted to resolve problems of his people through the parliamentary system and under the Constitution.
The PM was of the view that Pakistan’s existing system was ineffective to address militancy.
“More than 90,000 innocent people were killed in terrorist attacks but not even nine terrorists were convicted. This shows that our system does not work. Three previous parliaments also failed to address the issue,” he added.
Despite existing threats, he pointed out, the country has no such law to punish terrorists.
Change of govt
Asked about the civil-military imbalance, PM Kakar said the change of government should be made through ballot and the government should perform democratically and be accountable to its deeds.
“The problems begin when the government fails to follow democracy and this issue is also being debated in the West. I am also an advocate of the democratic system but people’s support comes only when the civil side performs,” he added.
 
 

He said when civil authorities failed to deliver, it created a space for military to enter and when military entered it usually delivered.
Asked will the next prime minister have powers to freely decide the country’s financial matters, especially after the formation of Special Investment and Finance Council where army has its representation, PM Kakar said the SIFC had provided more space to the prime minister where all relevant institutions briefed him about the economic situation and decisions were made with the military’s support.
“Final decision of the SIFC is made by the PM,” he added.

2,KP governor asks ECP to allay parties’ concerns,"Ghulam Ali highlights law and order, electricity, harsh winter as major issues","KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa Governor Ghulam Ali has urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to address concerns raised by political parties regarding the February 8 general elections.
In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Mr Ali said: “It would be better if the election commission calls a high-level meeting of these political parties before the elections or a few days after them, and takes action after hearing their concerns.”
His statement came a day after the Senate adopted a resolution seeking to postpone general elections, set to be held on February 8, over security and bad weather concerns. The resolution passed on Friday was moved by Senator Dilawar Khan with only 15 lawmakers in attendance.
In the interview, Governor Ali mentioned the issues of “law and order, 18-hour-long load-shedding, and toughest winter” that were hindering polls.
“In other areas where there is winter as well as snow — including Naran, Kalam, Swat and Chitral — people are saying how we will encourage our voters to come out [and vote],” Governor Ali said, adding that there were reports forecasting snowfall in Peshawar as well. The governor said Peshawar was facing the “toughest winter” and asked, “Which voter would come out [of their homes] in this situation?”

Ghulam Ali highlights law and order, electricity, harsh winter as major issues 

He also claimed that none of the parties he had talked to “wanted the elections to not take place” but rather, their “demand was for peace and protection”.
Mr Ali said it was his “respectful request and suggestion” to the ECP to sit with the political parties and “convince” them how it could provide them protection.
The reason why people were questioning whether the elections would take place or not was that a “tempo is not being created”.
He said that it was the provincial government’s duty to “improve the law and order situation and protect the people.” 
The governor said the federal government and state institutions were also responsible for the same, highlighting that the army had agreed to deploy troops and provide the requisite support, he said.
He stated that the time frame of polls being held within 90 days of the National Assembly’s dissolution had passed “so elections should take place”, but the reservations should be considered.

3,PML-N leaders discuss poll strategy with Shehbaz,Ex-PM says Feb 8 elections would prove to be the starting point of Pakistan’s development.,"LAHORE: Various leaders of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz called on party president Shehbaz Sharif here on Sunday and discussed strategy for the forthcoming general election.
Those who met with the former prime minister included Khawaja Saad Rafiq, Khawaja Salman Rafiq, Mian Javed Latif, Mian Atta Manika, Malik Afzal Khokhar, Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha, Dr Zulfikar Bhatti, Sardar Irfan Dogar, Malik Saiful Mulook Khokhar, Tufail Jutt and Ashraf Jutt.

He said that after coming into power, the party would take revolutionary measures to save the people from inflation. He said that the voters knew that only the PML-N and Nawaz Sharif fulfilled the promises made during elections and all others cheated them. 
He said the PML-N government would restore trust of the financial institutions, investors as well as the general public in Pakistan and would balance the economic policy, and take both the people and financial institutions together.

4,No let-up in Bilawal’s acrimony against ‘recurring PM’ Nawaz,Says he won’t accept one person in power again and again.,"LAHORE: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari continued with his acrimonious campaign against the PML-N, saying he won’t accept one person coming into power again and again.
While he didn’t name anyone, his apparent target was PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, whose party is vying to form the government for the fourth time after the Feb 8 general elections.
“We don’t accept one person again and again. The people of Pakistan have to decide who should be their prime minister,” the PPP leader said on Sunday while addressing a gathering on the eve of opening his election offices in the National Assembly’s constituency NA-127 in Lahore.
Doubling down on his remarks, the PPP leader claimed he would beat those people in their home who had been “imposed on Punjab by the former dictator Ziaul Haq”.
 






“The people who have been imposed on Punjab by Gen Zia ask us why we have come to contest elections from Lahore. We ask them why they came here. Gen Zia and Gen Hameed Gul imposed them, and we tell them we’ll beat them in their home with the power of votes.”

Says he won’t accept one person in power again and again

Lahore neither belongs to any businessman nor any sportsman, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, as he also targeted his other political rival, PTI’s Imran Khan.
He said his grandfather, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and mother, Benazir Bhutto, had been contesting elections from Lahore, and he was following their suit.
 






While referring to his party’s workers, the PPP leader said he was doing “the politics of jiyalas” and didn’t need support from anywhere else. “[These] jiyalas neither bow down nor retreat out of fear.”
Urging the party workers to take PPP’s election manifesto to the doorsteps of voters, he promised to fight inflation and unemployment by implementing his 10-point manifesto.
Under the manifesto, he said the salaries of government employees would be doubled, while poor families would receive 300 units of free electricity each month.
The medical treatment for the poor would also be free of cost, he claimed.
Criticising the opponents, the PPP leader said when “these people” fall sick, they go to London for treatment.
He promised that if voted to power, he would build houses for three million Pakistanis, expand the social welfare scheme, Benazir Income Support Programme, issue cards to factory workers and farmers for financial benefits and introduce schemes at the union council level to eliminate hunger.
Responding to a query about rumours of a possible delay in general elections, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said elections would not be postponed.

5,State-owned entities lost Rs1.4 trillion in two fiscal years,SOEs’ consolidated report shows number of profitable enterprises dropped from 56 in FY21 to 50 in FY22.,"ISLAMABAD: The nation’s state-run commercial entities incurred losses amounting to a staggering Rs1.395 trillion over the fiscal years 2021 and 2022, the latest consolidated report by the Ministry of Finance has revealed.
This figure is more than twice the size of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), bringing to light significant concerns regarding financial management and operational efficiency in the public sector.
The report, titled ‘Federal Footprint State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Consolidated Report FY2020-22’, has been launched by the Ministry of Finance under a performance benchmark of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 
 

It indicates that of the 81 evaluated SOEs, 50 reported a combined profit of Rs568.44 billion in fiscal 2022. However, this was overshadowed by the Rs730.26bn cumulative loss of the remaining 31 entities, resulting in a net loss of about Rs162bn.

SOEs’ consolidated report shows number of profitable enterprises dropped from 56 in FY21 to 50 in FY22

The previous fiscal year (2021) painted a similar picture, with a net loss of over Rs238bn, despite 56 entities reporting a total profit of Rs427.43bn, as 25 entities posted a cumulative loss of Rs665bn.
The report strangely shows Pakistan Steel Mills’ loss of Rs18.75bn in 2021 turned into a profit of Rs7.15bn the next year without producing a single billet or selling a steel bar as it remained closed for almost a decade.
The report also showed four power distribution companies turning from profitability in 2021 to colossal losses in 2022. These included a Rs3.5bn profit of Islamabad Electric in 2021, moving south to Rs16.4bn loss a year later, while Gujranwala Electric’s Rs1bn profit turned to a Rs20.6bn loss the following year.
Also,  Tribal Electric showed a Rs5.5bn profit in 2021 but posted a Rs21bn loss the next year, while Multan Electric’s Rs10bn profit converted into a Rs23bn loss.
On the other hand, Hyderabad Electric’s Rs75bn losses posted in 2021 came down to Rs54bn in 2022 while Lahore Electric’s losses at Rs17.6bn in 2021 almost doubled to Rs30bn a year later.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) remained the top loss-making entity for both years, with a combined loss of Rs422bn — Rs255bn in 2021 and Rs167bn in 2022 — almost equivalent to the civil government’s annual expenditure.
However, the report said the commercial SOE portfolio was contributing significantly to the national economy through corporate taxes, dividends, and employment.
It said the financial sector assets, comprising banks, insurance companies, Non-Banking Financing Companies (NBFCs) and Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) reached Rs8.9tr in the fiscal year 2022, showing consistent growth over the last three fiscal years.
Their revenues surged to Rs614.65bn, rising 31pc from the previous fiscal year. Net profits of the financial sector soared to Rs72.57bn, an increase of 46.5pc year on year. With an asset base of Rs7.98tr, the Infrastructure, Transport and Communication (ITC) stood as the second-largest sector among state-owned enterprises.
While the sector showcased remarkable growth in assets, spearheaded by the NHA, its employment figures dipped to 117,028 individuals due to a reduction in Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) workforce.
Despite a substantial 38pc revenue growth, the sector grappled with a net loss of Rs294.5bn, emphasising challenges in balancing socio-economic goals with operational efficiency.
The asset base of the manufacturing, mining and engineering sector showed robust growth, escalating by 49pc to Rs904.52bn and posting a net profit of Rs12.27bn in 2021 against previous years of losses.
The oil and gas sector, boasting assets worth Rs5.62tr, posted revenue expansion of 82pc, thanks to a surge in energy prices following the post-Covid period.
With a workforce exceeding 139,000 individuals, the power sector saw its assets climb to Rs6.48tr. However, persistent equity challenges were evident, marked by net losses and a considerable reliance on government support.
While the sector exhibited revenue growth owing to substantial price hikes, reaching Rs3tr in fiscal 2022, operational margins remained a point of concern.
The report also showed that state-run media — namely Pakistan Broadcasting and Pakistan Television — together remained a burden on public kitty. The two paid zero dividends to the government.
While PTV remained in profit in both 2021 and 2022, its financial performance appeared to be going down, as evidenced by its Rs398 million profit in 2022 compared to Rs651m a year earlier, although the nine-channel network reaches more than 90pc of the country’s population.
However, Pakistan Broadcasting showed declining financial performance. Its Rs741m losses in 2021 surged to Rs1.142bn in 2022. Overall, the government’s media entertainment segment plunged from a Rs1bn profit in the 2019 fiscal year to a Rs742m loss in 2022.

6,Protests go on in GB despite bid to seal sit-in venue,"Gilgit administration imposes Section 144, banning public gatherings citing security threats.","GILGIT: Protest demonstrations continued across Gilgit-Baltistan on Sunday against subsidised wheat price hike and other grievances, despite hurdles created by the administration to stop protests in Gilgit.
The venue of the protest was cordoned off, with police and law enforcement agencies personnel deployed to stop people from reaching the venue.
The Gilgit administration also imposed Section 144 in the district on Sunday, banning public gathering citing security threats.
Police and law-enforcement agencies personnel were deployed in Ghari Bagh, Gilgit to stop protest demonstrations against subsidised wheat hike and other demands.
The Awami Action Committee (AAC) has been organising daily protest sit-in for three hours in every GB district.
Protesters gathered in Garibagh Gilgit on Sunday and organised the protest sit-in, defying the government ban.
However, no clash took place between law enfor­cement personnel and protesters.
Speaking on the occasion, Awami Action Committee leader Fida Hussain said the people have been organising peaceful protests without any political agenda.
He said the committee has created religious harmony in the region and people belonging to various schools of thought are part of the committee and they are holding the protest jointly.
AAC chief coordinator Advocate Ehsan Ali, speaking to protesters at Garibagh Gilgit, said the peaceful protest would continue till the acceptance of their all demands, including restoration of 2022 wheat subsidy.
He said the demands of the people were not illegal or unconstitutional, and accused the government of not being serious in resolving the issues.
He said the federal government, through the GB government, is imposing such decisions which are unacceptable to the locals.

In a press conference on Sunday, BSF leaders, including former caretaker Balochistan minister Nawabzada Jamal Raisani, also urged the caretaker government to ensure a secure environment in the province to prevent the killings of innocent Baloch people by banned outfits like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Force (BLF) and Baloch Republican Army (BRA).
They demanded the Supreme Court to withdraw its decision, which had declared unconstitutional the military trials of civilians.
The leaders of the group, which claims to empower the victims of terrorism, said thousands, not only from Balochistan but from Punjab and other areas, have been killed by the banned terrorist organisations.
The BSF leaders said if the government failed to provide security to the people of Balochistan, they would have no option but to take up arms against the terrorists.
They claimed the governments of India and Israel were “funding terrorist organisations in Balochistan”.
The BSF is also holding a protest in the federal capital, where some other Baloch activists have set up a separate camp demanding the recovery of missing persons.
Responding to a question, Mr Raisani said his group also supported the call for the recovery of missing persons but questioned if the protesters who are demanding this would condemn the banned organisations like BLA, BLF and BRA.

9,Families of Baloch ‘missing persons’ hold sit-in in UK,"Ayesha Siddiqa, Khan of Kalat join five-day protest outside 10 Downing Street.","LONDON: A five-day sit-in by rights activists and relatives of a Baloch businessman, who went missing in 2020, culminated on Sunday outside the Prime Minister’s Office here.
Five days earlier, Salia Marri, the wife of the missing Baloch businessman Mir Taj Mohammad Sarparah, appealed in a video message for the release of all Baloch missing persons including her husband.
Ms Marri, who is the niece of Khair Bakhsh Marri, appealed to activists, political parties and journalists to join the sit-in outside 10 Downing Street which was held around the clock for five days.
 






In a video message recorded at the sit-in, Mr Sarparah’s daughter Ibrah Taj stated: “My father was forcibly disappeared on July 19, 2020 from Karachi. Till date his fate and whereabouts remain unknown. It has been more than three years and five months but still there is no news about him. Every household in Balochistan shares the same fate.
 






UN investigation sought
“I urge the British government and UN to investigate this matter and to take action against the perpetrators. Give us answers [as to] whether my father is alive.”

Ayesha Siddiqa, Khan of Kalat join five-day protest outside 10 Downing Street

The sit-in was joined by supporters of the recovery of Baloch missing persons, as well as prominent Baloch dissident/pro-independence leaders such as Hyrbyair Marri and Mir Suleiman Ahmedzai who holds the title of Khan of Kalat.
Writer and analyst Ayesha Siddiqa also joined the sit-in, saying it is wrong and cruel to pick up citizens and make them disappear.
“This is state terrorism which should end. The world and UN should take notice of this. Like international issues like Kashmir and Palestine, the cruelty in Balochistan should not be forgotten. Because of state mistreatment for years they [the Baloch] are hurt. This is a political issue being dealt with through cruelty and force, it is barbaric and should end.”
The Baloch missing persons issue in recent weeks has elicited an outcry in the international community, as a UK MP, some weeks earlier, called on the British government to pay attention to abductions and disappearances of Baloch persons in Pakistan.
Prominent youth climate activist Greta Thunberg also expressed solidarity with the families of Baloch missing persons, and tweeted about the detention and police action against peaceful protesters in Pakistan.

13,Balochistan remains polio free since 2021,Balochistan’s success is not merely a statistical triumph but is evident in the dwindling numbers of vaccine refusals.,"QUETTA: In the face of multiple challenges, Balochistan has defied the odds, maintaining its polio-free status for nearly three years as the last case was detected in January 2021.
Despite encountering positive environmental samples, the resilient efforts of the region have kept the poliovirus at bay. This remarkable accomplishment serves as a testament to the dedication and hard work of various stakeholders, ranging from healthcare professionals, religious scholars, tribal notables to community members.
Balochistan’s success is not merely a statistical triumph but is evident in the dwindling numbers of vaccine refusals, which decreased by 33 per cent in Quetta block. The children who are persistently missing the vaccination dose for consecutively three or more campaigns were reduced by 49 per cent in Quetta block districts (Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Pishin and Quetta).
Around 10,000 children were identified and vaccinated against crippling polio disease which was previously hidden by the parents due to misconception about polio vaccine. Seventy-one per cent zero dose children vaccinated in Quetta block through extended outreach activities and on EPI sites.
These positive indicators reflect a robust surveillance and vaccination strategy that has successfully navigated the intricate landscape of healthcare delivery. Against the backdrop of harsh weather conditions and persistent security challenges, the unsung heroes of the polio eradication initiative are the frontline polio workers specially the women.
These dedicated individuals ensure that no child is left unvaccinated. Their commitment, often in the face of adversity, exemplifies the spirit of perseverance required to tackle a public health crisis of this magnitude.
“We saw how these brave females dedicatedly work during the campaign. There are mothers who often carry their little children even in harsh weather as no one is at home to take care off. We have seen female workers coming with their fathers and brothers in the field on motorbikes and tractors. Many have to cover miles and miles on foot in tough terrain.
“Hats off to them, their dedication is truly exemplary. With their efforts, we were able to reduce the number of refusals by 33 per cent in the year 2023,” said Shahpur Suleman, Social Behavioral Change Specialist, Unicef Balochistan.
