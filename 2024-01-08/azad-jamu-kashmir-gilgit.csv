2,‘Surplus’ inspectors face novel dilemma,Await suitable postings in CTP after clearing required tests,"The Rawalpindi City Traffic Police is facing a novel challenge in the wake of the promotion of a substantial number of sub-inspectors, which has led to an excess number of inspectors in the department.
According to sources within the department, the number of inspector-level officers is well over the number of allotted seats.
The surplus inspectors are currently handling duties as duty officers, with others awaiting departmental promotion after completing required courses.
The initiative for promotions across Punjab police, initiated during IG Dr Usman Anwar's tenure, aimed to boost confidence and enhance efficiency within the police force. However, concerns are emerging in Rawalpindi about the increasing number of inspectors and the potential challenges in finding suitable postings.
Parallelly, a survey has been initiated in Punjab to gather opinions from wardens regarding promotions. Traffic police officers from Lahore have approached the Punjab IG seeking departmental promotions, stating that they have cleared the Punjab Public Service Commission exams but face challenges in the aftermath.

In response, the IGP ordered a survey, seeking opinions on promotions based on seniority lists or including consideration for the public service exam.
Caretaker Punjab CM and IGP have been requested to address the situation. Police officers have suggested opening deputation opportunities for inspectors and wardens in various departments across the province.
Upon the establishment of CTP in 2007, 100 inspector seats were allocated for Rawalpindi. Later, the number of seats was increased.
Currently, the CTP operates in Murree and other tehsils, with the recent promotions bringing the number of inspectors to over 250.
The Express Tribune attempted to contact the Punjab Additional Traffic IG for a statement, but calls went unanswered.

3,When compassion guides artistic endeavours,Samina Jamshed’s journey reflects the therapeutic properties of art,"Anxious and perplexed, they share a moment of unease before closing their eyes for a unique scribbling technique session. Then, a cold silence falls before most of them burst into tears.
A calm figure enters the scene, takes centre stage and skilfully channels their emotions with intriguing techniques.
These scenes are from a three-day healing session conducted for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (GBV) in the federal capital.
The participants were to attempt a scribbling game with their eyes closed as the idea behind it was to open the wounds or rekindle the traumas they have experienced and then help them stitch them back.
Around 25 participants from across the country participated in the therapy session, conducted by acclaimed visual artist, certified therapist and activist Samina Jamshed.
Through art therapy, well-being sessions, mental health counselling, and the creation of safe spaces, Samina empowers these young survivors to reclaim their lives and equip them with the tools to bring positive change to their communities.
Read  Sixteen-day of activism against GBV concludes
“Art therapy, a unique form of therapy that utilises artistic expression to promote healing, has gained recognition as an effective method in addressing trauma and fostering emotional well-being,” says Samina as she engages with the participants of the circle.
An internationally recognised expert in her field, she brings her expertise to these sessions, where she not only facilitates the girls' healing journey but also provides them with the necessary skills to uplift them in ways unimaginable.
“The sessions were designed to create a safe and inclusive environment where the survivors could explore their emotions, express themselves freely, and rebuild their resilience,” she asserts.
Using various art forms, such as painting, drawing, and sculpting, the girls were encouraged to channel their emotions and experiences into meaningful creations. These therapeutic exercises allowed them to process their trauma, develop coping mechanisms, and reconnect with their inner strengths. However, the impact of these sessions went far beyond personal healing. Each participant was asked to identify essential tools they would take back to their communities and focused groups. Tools that would enable them to create positive change and uplift others facing similar challenges.

The girls wholeheartedly embraced this task, showcasing their determination to break the cycle of violence and support fellow survivors. Reflecting on the session, one of the participants said Samina is truly gifted. “She not only healed us, but she stitched our wounds back together with a touch of empathy. It's something we never expected and we feel empowered and ready to help others who have been through what we experienced.”
The appreciation from the girls exemplifies the profound impact of art therapy and Samina’s exceptional ability to connect with survivors. Her empathetic approach, coupled with her expertise, has fostered an environment of trust and healing, providing a solid foundation for the girls to rebuild their lives and positively influence those around them, said another survivor.
Samina’s work is a testament to the power of art therapy in addressing the lasting effects of SGBV. Her dedication and the transformative nature of her sessions highlight the importance of investing in holistic approaches to support survivors, allowing them to find their voices, heal, and become catalysts for change in their communities.
As the girls return to their provinces, armed with newfound resilience and the four tools they carefully selected, they carry with them the promise of a brighter future—one in which healing and empowerment become widespread, and the scars of SGBV are replaced with hope and solidarity.

Other than conducting healing sessions, Samina works closely with refugees, IDPs, humanitarian workers, drug addicts, special persons and women fighting severe forms of depression.
Apart from being a noted visual artist and art therapist, she is a fine sculptor and poet, having showcased her work in France, the US, Canada, and other parts of the world. Her paintings have recently been selected for an exhibition in Rome this month amongst artists from 64 countries.
According to her, she started the previous year with the commitment to conduct mental well-being and healing circle sessions throughout the year for people in need, may that be refugees or host communities.
She conducted 30 healing circles and 24 mental well-being and art therapy sessions, concluding the year in Bali, Indonesia, with a music therapy session for humanitarian workers from across Asia.

5,Drought sparks water shortage fears,"Ongoing constructions in city coupled with increasing population, have heightened water demand","The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad are facing a looming water crisis as the water levels in Rawal and Khanpur dams have rapidly declined due to prolonged drought conditions.
Residents of the neighbouring cities heavily depend on these dams, each now having the capacity to provide 90 days of water. Concerns are rising about a potential water shortage before the onset of summer.
The ongoing constructions in the city and cantonment areas of Rawalpindi, coupled with the increasing population, have heightened the water demand. The anticipated crisis is exacerbated by the lack of progress on the Ghazi Barotha Water Supply Project, aimed at ensuring a long-term water supply to the twin cities. The project, initially estimated at Rs72 billion, has seen its cost rise to Rs150 billion due to prolonged delays.
The Ghazi Barotha Water Supply project envisioned to deliver 600 million gallons of water per day in three phases, has faced setbacks, with progress limited to briefings and discussions. The daily water requirement continues to rise as development agencies approving building plans neglect to obtain necessary clearances from water supply agencies.
Read Old city area plagued with water woes
Currently, Rawalpindi faces a daily water supply shortfall of 17 million gallons, projected to escalate to 140 million gallons by 2050. Despite ongoing projects like the Chahan Dam and Daducha Dam, and efforts supported by the Asian Development Bank to expand the water supply network, a 100-million-gallon daily shortage is expected even after their completion. The Ghazi Barotha project's 24 km water pipeline, connecting Ghazi Barotha to the Sangjani Water Treatment and Storage Site, is deemed essential to address this shortfall.
For 15 years, successive governments have declared the Ghazi Barotha Water Supply Project as feasible, projecting it to meet water needs for the next century. However, continuous delays have escalated the project's cost, and despite numerous presentations and discussions at various government levels, tangible progress has been elusive.
Water supply experts warn of a rapid decline in underground water levels, leading to the eventual failure of existing tube wells. The cost of water obtained through these wells is expected to rise significantly due to high electricity bills. In contrast, the Ghazi Barotha project promises cheap and clean water, to be supplied through water filtration plants, providing 200 million gallons per day in each of its three phases.
Upon completion, the project aims to eliminate reliance on tube wells and existing water sources, signalling a crucial step towards ensuring a consistent and affordable water supply for the twin cities over the next century.

Jamil’s artistic finesse navigated the enigmatic world of reflections, transforming reflective surfaces into canvases that mirrored reality while transcending into realms beyond.

“Welcome to a mesmerising journey through the realms of perception and illusion,” shared Jamil in his video message. He said, “My art aims to explore the multifaceted nature of reality, where reflections became gateways to understanding the layers that cloak our perceptions.”

7,Study stresses smoking’s impact on public health,SDPI says cigarette industry inflicted Rs567b blow to country’s finances,"The pervasive influence of Pakistan’s cigarette industry on policymaking has exacted a toll on both the nation’s financial well-being and public health but also caused a staggering Rs567 billion loss in revenue over the last decade.
The alarming loss of revenue was unearthed through a comprehensive study delving into the dynamics of the cigarette sector and scrutinising Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) data, said a statement issued by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Sunday.
The WHO estimates that over 8 million people die each year globally due to tobacco use, with Pakistan recording an estimated 135.14 deaths per 100,000 people in 2019 totalling approximately 337,500.
Read Tobacco harm reduction strategies urged
According to a study by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), the total costs attributable to smoking-related diseases and deaths in Pakistan for 2019 reached an additional Rs615.07 billion ($3.85 billion), with indirect costs (morbidity and mortality) making up 70% of the total cost.
However, the cigarette industry managed to influence decision-making, which not only resulted in a Rs567 billion loss in potential revenue but also put an extra burden on the country’s fragile healthcare system.
In its report titled “Pakistan: Overview of Tobacco Use, Tobacco Control Legislation, and Taxation”, the World Bank has also revealed the decline in revenue in the 2016-2017 fiscal year was carefully planned by the powerful cigarette industry.
The study brings attention to the influence of the introduction of a three-tier excise duty structure, raising concerns about tax evasion and its adverse effects on public health.

8,‘Illegally promoted’ officials face demotions,Advancement of those getting shoulder promotions reversed,"The promotions of General Excise Taxation and Narcotic Control officers, who received shoulder promotions based on their own pay scale (OPS), have been cancelled and they have been demoted to their previous ranks.
It was brought to the attention of Director General (DG) Excise Taxation and Narcotic Control, Muhammad Ali, that 18 junior officials of six and seven scale who did not meet the required qualifications had been posted as excise inspectors in certain exclusive areas of Rawalpindi on OPS basis over inspectors who were at senior positions and more qualified for promotions.
The DG then promptly ordered the reversal of all promotions to the position of excise inspectors back to the rank of clerk and tasked them with performing their original responsibilities. At the same time, he has ordered the appointment of senior and qualified excise inspectors in the property tax zones.

He also took strict notice of complaints of non-implementation of the Biometric Attendance System in the Rawalpindi Region Office and issued show-cause notices to 50 officers and personnel of the Rawalpindi Region Property Branch. The officers are expected to reply within seven days. Orders to implement biometric attendance were also issued.
The DG said that strict action will be taken against officers and personnel who do not follow the standard procedures of the office.
Additionally, the DG has expressed deep displeasure over the gross failure of the property and motor branch of the Rawalpindi region to achieve the revenue target for the first 6 months of the financial year 2023-24, from July 1 to December. They were only able to get 40% of the revenue in both terms. To rectify the issue, the DG has also issued instructions to all officers and inspectors to work in the field instead of offices and complete the recoveries by January 31.
