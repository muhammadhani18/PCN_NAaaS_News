0,"Portion of Murree Road ‘encroached’ by Islamabad Club, Senate informed",The Islamabad Club has assured CDA that they will pay rent for the encroached area.,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has confirmed that a portion of the right of way of Murree Road is in the possession of the Islamabad Club for “parking purposes since the 1990s”.
This was informed by the CDA to the Senate through the Ministry of Interior a few days ago, according to documents.
The CDA stated that its building control section through a letter dated Feb 24, 2023, directed the Islamabad Club’s management “for the removal of violations/encroachment of right of way of Murree Road and removal of [its] fence”.
In response to the letter, the club said that there were multiple issues related to the shifting of the fence, such as important guests and dignitaries “are normally stationed at the club and relocating of fence/boundary would pose a potential threat”. The CDA said that the club also assured that no permanent structure thereon would be created and the fence would be removed and shifted whenever required by the CDA. The document also stated that the management had assured the CDA that they were willing to pay rent for the area mentioned above.
The CDA had leased out 352.8 acre for the establishment of Islamabad Club. On Jan 2, Senator Mushtaq Ahmed asked the CDA several questions about the posh club during the question-hour session in the upper house, asking whether it was true that the said club had illegally occupied 32.5 kanal adjacent to the club.
The CDA officials told Dawn that the right of way of Murree Road was occupied by the Islamabad Club and added that the civic body had issued notices to the management of the club last year, but to no avail.
It is relevant to note that reportedly in 2020, the land of the club was leased out for 53 years and it pays only Rs3 for an acre per month to the CDA.
According to details available on its website, the club was established in 1967 to provide recreational and sports facilities for government servants, diplomats and other inhabitants of Islamabad.
“Initially [it was] registered as a limited company, titled ‘The Islamabad Club’ under the Companies Act of 1913. In 1978, through the presidential ordinance […] July 17, 1978, the club ownership was resumed by the government of Pakistan and the company was dissolved. Since then, it has been operating under the […] Club Ordinance,” read the website.
It further said that the club is a statutory body and the president of Pakistan is its patron. Moreover, the facility is under the administrative control of the Cabinet Division.
“Islamabad Club is an unincorporated club comprising of its members and is functioning under the ambit of Islamabad Club (Administration) Ordinance 1978 (Club Ordinance). [The] club is not a recipient of any government grants/PSDP funding etc.,” it said and added that the administration and assets of the club “are vested in the administrator, who is appointed by the federal government and is aided and advised by a managing committee, which is also appointed by the federal government”.

According to a Met official, a shallow westerly wave will keep the western and northern parts of the country in the grip of cold weather. He said light rain was expected in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Potohar, upper Punjab and Kashmir.
Meanwhile, rain and snow are anticipated in northern Balochistan and hilly areas of KP whereas fog and smog will prevail in the plain areas of Punjab and upper Sindh.
Regarding the twin cities, the official said though no strong wave was visible, there were chances of light rain in a few places on Monday.
He said on Sunday, the minimum temperature recorded in Islamabad was 1 degree Celsius, which was likely to drop to zero degrees Celsius on Monday.
About the effects of the cold weather, Dr Mohammad Akhtar of Holy Family Hospital (HFH) said the present cold and dry spell was giving rise to various diseases including flu, typhoid, asthma, dry cough and scabies, particularly among children and old people.
He urged parents to protect their children against chill by ensuring they were properly covered, and stressed on increasing the intake of water to maintain the required moisture in the skin.
Mr Akhtar said a balanced diet and soup could minimise the effects of dry and cold weather, emphasising on the use of boiled water and washing hands before eating.

2,CDA again mulling renting out plots to private schools,There are 100 plots available for school education and civic agency could earn billions of rupees by auctioning them,"ISLAMABAD: The incumbent management of Capital Development Authority (CDA) is also mulling renting out school plots worth billions of rupees instead of putting them on open auctions. 
The controversial policy of renting out school plots for 33 years was approved in April last year. Later, however, the policy was shelved. Now, sources said, once again various wings of the CDA were holding meetings to discuss the matter.
The sources said that on last Friday a meeting was held to discuss the financial model of the scheme. 
However, when contacted, Member Technology and Digitisation Nauman Khalid, who is also spokesperson for the CDA, told Dawn that he would check it out on Monday.

There are 100 plots available for school education and civic agency could earn billions of rupees by auctioning them, says official

“Since the policy was approved before my joining I have no idea about it. I will check it out. Secondly, I have no idea about the meeting held on Friday,” he said. 
However, the sources said the meeting held on Friday discussed in detail the financial model of the scheme. It was decided that another meeting will be held soon.
The sources said the meeting was held to finalise the financial model as the CDA board in April last year had approved the renting policy but delayed a decision on the financial model.
Last year, after approval of the policy, the CDA had sought applications from private schools and in response received over 200 applications from owners of private schools.
Primarily, after failing to shift private schools from residential areas, the CDA introduced the new policy to give plots to private parties on rent. It was decided that plots will be rented out to private schools in accordance with a 100 marks formula, including 20pc marks fixed for schools operating in houses and 25pc for institutes charging Rs5,000 to Rs15,000 monthly fee. The CDA board had also decided that schools will be bound not to enhance their fee by more than five per cent per year.
A CDA official said the civic agency in the past had allotted plots for private schools at subsidised rates. However, he added, ideally private schools should be allotted plots after a competitive process, as running schools had become a lucrative business.
He said currently the CDA had around 100 plots available for school education and through their open auction the civic agency could fetch billions of rupees.
The 100 marks formula was approved in April last year in the presence of the already finalised policy of 2019 on allocation of plots for private schools which the CDA had also submitted to the Islamabad High Court.
The policy was finalised after holding a series of meetings with stakeholders, including owners of private schools, Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Authority (Peira), proposing various steps to manage schools, particularly operating in residential areas.
In that policy, it was proposed that three years should be given to private schools operating in residential areas for relocation and every sector there should be Montessori and daycare centres. The policy also recommended that private schools should be allowed in Zone 2, 4 and 5 on private land.
In this regard, bylaws were formulated which had to be followed for construction of schools in these areas. The CDA would facilitate the managements of such schools in obtaining NOC and in the approval process. But instead of implementing the policy, the CDA last year came up with the new idea of renting out plots to private school owners.
In the past, the civic agency had too faced controversy while allotting plots for schools. In 2008, it had allotted plots to private schools in a dubious manner. The civic agency allotted 19 plots and only three of them were declared legal by courts. Resultantly, the civic agency had to cancel the allotment of 16 plots.
In that scheme, the CDA as per an advertisement was supposed to deal with only Islamabad-based schools, but it allotted plots mainly to schools operating in other cities. The CDA also entertained applications after the deadline and was also accused of allotting plots in various sectors on pick and choose basis.

3,Notices issued to 63 Pindi educational institutions for ‘regularisation’ of buildings,"Private schools and colleges would have to pay 10pc of the rental value of their building for regularisation, says RDA Director General Saif Anwar Jappa.","RAWALPINDI: After a survey of the city, the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has issued notices to 63 educational institutions located on main roads, asking them to regularise their buildings by paying a 10 per cent fee for commercial use of the premises or shift to a different place.
These educational institutions are operating in Asghar Mall Scheme, Mohanpura, Saidpur Road, Satellite Town, Murree Road, Dhoke Khabba and other areas.
RDA Director General Saif Anwar Jappa told Dawn that the civic body had completed the survey of the schools and colleges to regularise them through the payment of an annual fee and parking arrangements on their premises to avoid traffic congestion on roads. According to Mr Jappa, the private schools and colleges would have to pay 10 per cent of the rental value of their building, as per the official rate of the property, for regularisation.
He said that the RDA wanted to start an operation against the ‘illegal’ educational institutions but Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha decided to give them time till the end of the academic year.
The decision was taken so that the educational activities of the children were not interrupted by the RDA action and they could complete their academic year without any hindrance. He said that in light of this decision, it is said that all school owners who have built schools in residential buildings without approval are directed to immediately regularise the schools as per the law or stop this unauthorised use. In this regard, they will submit an affidavit within 15 days to the RDA that they were ready to legalise their schools or stop the “illegal use of these buildings”.
“If the school buildings are not regularised then the owners of these buildings will have to pay a fine of Rs1,000 per day until the use of the residential building for the purpose of a school is regularised,” the official said.
Similarly, if the affidavit is not submitted within 15 days, legal action will be taken against the institutions.
On the other hand, due to the presence of private schools on the main roads of the city, traffic was badly affected and commuters faced trouble. Most private schools and colleges failed to establish parking areas on their premises and people had no other option but to park vehicles on main roads.
Last week, Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha asked the district and cantonment authorities to take action against the educational institutions, hospitals and other commercial centres on main roads to arrange their parking space. He asked all the schools, hospitals and other commercial establishments to manage their parking within their premises, adding that strict action would be taken against the organisations that did not provide parking space. Mr Chattha directed the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation and the traffic police to clear the roads in the city areas of encroachments for efficient traffic management and open them for traffic.

4,Year’s first polio immunisation campaign starts in Punjab today,"RAWALPINDI: The first immunisation campaign of 2024 will commence on Monday (today) all over Punjab, including...","RAWALPINDI: The first immunisation campaign of 2024 will commence on Monday (today) all over Punjab, including Rawalpindi.
In Rawalpindi, Lahore and Faisalabad, the campaign will continue for seven days while in other districts it will last five days, said head of the polio programme and Punjab Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) coordinator Khizer Afzaal.
“Over 200,000 polio workers and supervisors will participate in the drive to immunise 22.5 million children under the age of five. This include 16,605 area in-charges, 3,991 union council medical officers, over 84,884 mobile polio team members, 4,884 fixed team members and over 2,664 transit team members,” he said.
He said the first national campaign of the year will lay a strong foundation for a polio-free year and eventually eradication of the virus.
“It is imperative that we start the year with a strong campaign and continue momentum against the virus. Amid polio virus circulation in other provinces, Punjab has not reported any case since October 2020 which is an achievement of the programme. The positivity rate of polio environmental samples has also gone down by 1 per cent. After successful implementation of quality polio campaigns, samples from all environmental sites have been reported negative. However, movement of population from core reservoirs to Punjab was one of the major causes of virus importation,” said Mr Afzaal.
He praised polio workers and said they had been on the forefront and continued to reach children in some of the hardest-to-access areas to ensure a polio-free world for the future generations. He also cautioned them against complacency saying the country could not afford to let poliovirus return to the province.
He said the government of Punjab through the health department was ensuring the safety and security of the frontline heroes. “The government and health department have pledged to make all efforts to provide essential support to workers and facilitate them during unforeseen challenges.” 
He said multiple doses of polio drops offered the best protection against poliovirus, highlighting the need to vaccinate every child to achieve population’s immunity and prevent virus circulation.
“Parents must welcome polio teams whenever they come to their doorsteps. Local communities must be reassured that immunisation is a safe and effective means of safeguarding their children against this virus. 2024 is the year that Pakistan aims to interrupt transmission of poliovirus from the country and the polio programme is working steadily towards that goal,” he said.

5,Sikh community celebrates Guru Gobind Singh’s birth anniversary,Members of other religious communities also attend celebrations at Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hasanabdal.,"

TAXILA: The Sikh community celebrated the 358th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh at the Sikh temple Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hasanabdal on Sunday.
The day was spent reciting from their religious scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, and cultural dancing while singing and chanting holy hymns as part of the Nagar Kirtan procession, featuring a palanquin adorned with flowers.
The major attraction of the procession was the display of ‘Gatka,’ a famous Sikh martial art, and other sword exercises from people of Khalsa School who came from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to demonstrate on this holy occasion. 
Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Attock President Sardar Ashar Hayat Khan was chief guest while a large number of members of the Sikh, Christian and Hindu communities were present on the occasion.
Sardar Ravinder Singh Jaggi, a local Granthi, said Guru Gobind Singh was the 10th and last Sikh Guru and his greatest achievement was the creation of the Khalsa in 1699. A Granthi is a person who recites the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib. He added that in his hymns of ‘Bachitar Natak’, he proclaimed his mission ‘to protect the righteous, oppressed and downtrodden people and to destroy the evil-doers’.

Members of other religious communities also attend celebrations at Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hasanabdal

According to Mr Singh, Guru Gobind preached for unity between humans, rejected all sorts of discrimination and preached equality and goodwill.
Asmatullah, caretaker of the Sikh temple, said it was a special day in the Sikh faith as it marked the birth anniversary of the 10th guru, adding Gobind Singh became a guru at the age of nine after the death of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur, and was assassinated in 1708 at the age of 41.
The leader of the local Christian community, Paul Gill, said such events would build understanding of traditions and beliefs of minorities, adding people here had shown a sign of interfaith harmony.
“We gathered here at Punja Sahib to honour the legacy of Guru Gobind Singh on his birth anniversary by spreading love, kindness and wisdom among the people around us,” said the PPP Attock president.
He expressed his gratitude to the diverse gathering for their enthusiasm and participation in the celebration of Guru Gobind Singh’s birth anniversary. He said there was total freedom for all minorities to practice their faith without any fear of discrimination in the country.
He was of the view that the participation of people from different faiths and expression of solidarity with the Sikh community was proof that all communities were partners in the development and progress of Pakistan.

The ministry declared the complaint a time limited case and sought proof against officials of Drap within seven days. 
A letter of the ministry, dated January 2, and available with Dawn, shows that the application was filed in March 2022. A copy of the application was also sent to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on which NAB sought a clarification from the health ministry on October 30, 2023. 
The letter stated that NAB had referred the matter to the ministry of NHS for necessary action. The complainant, Mohammad Usman, has been requested to submit the complaint on a stamp paper along with a copy of CNIC/affidavit and with solid proof/supporting documents as evidence of the complaint within seven days.
The complainant sent a reply to the ministry, stating the application had been sent to a number of departments, including the health ministry, in March 2022 and later it was published in national media. He claimed that after filing the application he himself visited the ministry a number of times but no one bothered to give any response to him or take action.
He said Drap had registered Paracetamol 665mg despite the fact that it had been banned in Europe since February 2018 due to deaths and liver failure. Moreover, he alleged that Drap registered the medicine at over three times higher rates compared to Paracetamol 500mg.
The complainant requested that under Article 19A of Constitution he be informed that who was the inquiry officer in the case and what was the goal behind demanding an affidavit/statement on stamp paper as written and signed complaints were accepted even in NAB and court of law.
He asked whether the inquiry will reach any conclusion or the practice was being made just to answer the letter of NAB. The applicant also asked for clarifications if Drap had taken any concrete action against the officials, especially authority’s former chief executive officer (CEO) whose fake degree was proved and he was removed by the federal cabinet on the directions of Islamabad High Court.
“I will be highly obliged if you would find some time to reply the above questions. We are always available to assist you to eradicate corruption from Drap in the best interest of poor Pakistanis. We can also assist you to develop and establish raw material manufacturing units in Pakistan to save foreign exchange,” Mr Usman said.

10,Pharwala Fort on its way to regain lost glory,"Once perceived to be a haven for outlaws and offenders and off-limits due to safety concerns, the Pharwala Fort has...","Once perceived to be a haven for outlaws and offenders and off-limits due to safety concerns, the Pharwala Fort has been declared open to the public, signalling its transformation into a prominent tourist destination.
The announcement comes after extensive efforts by the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM) to conserve and preserve this neglected historical site.
Undertaking significant excavation work since September, the DOAM initiated a comprehensive revival plan to restore the fort’s former grandeur.
Abdul Ghafoor Loan, deputy director of museums, highlighted the multifaceted approach, involving the clearance of dense surrounding foliage, excavation of debris to a depth of two feet, engagement of local villagers for security measures, and the establishment of facilities to support conservators in their endeavour to breathe life into the fort’s storied past.
Last year, the Federal Department of Archaeology and Museums, National Heritage and Culture Division, launched two pivotal projects.


Excavation work underway to conserve and preserve the historic sites

 
The first, costing Rs50 million, encompassed the ‘Master Plan for Conservation, Restoration, and Development of Mai Qamro Mosque and Muqarab Khan Tomb’ in the Islamabad Capital Territory.
The second project focused on the Pharwala Fort’s preservation and development, under the PC-II initiative. This initiative included comprehensive damage assessment, structural documentation, and the creation of a 3D animation detailing the expansive 36-acre fort complex, fortified by a 2km-long wall. The two projects were expected to be completed in two years.
Abdul Ghafoor Loan elaborated on the scope of the endeavour, underscoring the meticulous planning aimed at rejuvenating the Pharwala Fort, transforming it into a symbol of cultural significance.

The fort once shrouded in neglect and seclusion, now stands poised to captivate visitors with its rich heritage and restored allure, marking a triumphant revival in Islamabad’s historical landscape.
Abdul Ghafoor Loan said that the rulers of the Gakhar dynasty erected many structures during their reign. Gakhar Mosque, Mai Qamro mosque was an amazing specimen of Gakhar architecture. “The Gakhar Dynasty, Mai Qumro Mosque, belonged to the early 16th century. It is the oldest mosque in Islamabad, situated in Bagh Juggian, on the west bank of the Soan River near Pharwala Fort.
According to DOAM, the mosque was believed to have been built by Mai Qamro, Hathi Khan Gakhar’s wife, a Gakhar dynasty descendant. Women occupied a prestigious and influential position during the Gakhar rule. Mai Qamro acquired fame in the field of arts and architecture.
“There is also the amazing Muqurab Khan Tomb, the last chieftain of the Gakhar Dynasty, within an enclosure. He ruled in the 18th century from the districts of Attock to Jhelum and issued his coins. After he was killed and buried secretly in 1769, the Gakhar rule ended,” he said.

The initiatives would also enable DOAM to research and further investigate the region and explore new dynamics of Gakhar art and architecture in this region.
“After completing its archaeological excavation and investigations, DOAM will start preservation, conservation and restoration work to save the surviving cultural heritage of Pakistan in Islamabad,” the official said.
