KARACHI: As many as 122 Hindu couples from all over the country, particularly from Sindh, exchanged vows and tied the knot at the 17th Combined Marriages Programme held under the umbrella of the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) at the Railway Ground here on Sunday.
As the faces of most of the couples were hidden behind veils and sehra (nuptial crown), not much could be said about their happiness on starting a new era in their lives. But it was the priest getting them married, Maharaj Jai Kumar Trivedi, who looked very pleased indeed. During the past 16 years, he has been responsible for the marriage ceremonies of some 1,500 couples during the PHC mass weddings.
“Actually, I don’t even remember how many couples I got married till now as I have been doing this blessed work for 30 years now, even before doing it for PHC,” Maharaj Trivedi laughingly told Dawn as the model couple was being escorted to the stage or mandap to take their seven sacred vows of marriage.
Asked if there was any particular couple that left a mark on him, Maharaj said that he didn’t because there have been so many of them. “But I’m sure, they must all remember me,” he beamed.
The model couple, at such mass weddings, follows the priest’s instructions as the other couples watch and follow them in their individual mandaps.
Purvashi and Dev Dhanji, this occasion’s model couple, belonged to Karachi’s Ranchore Line area. Their families told Dawn that the couple had met about one year ago at another wedding and fallen in love.
Meanwhile, most other couples, especially from Sindh’s other cities, said that their marriages were arranged.

Paras and Raju Kumar from Badin met two years ago when the groom’s mother saw the girl and asked her mother for her hand for her son. “But then her mother would say that her daughter is too young. It took two years of convincing to reach this moment,” said Amrit, the groom’s mother.
Veeru and Pooja from Sanghar didn’t have to wait that long though as their marriage was fixed by their families only three months back. Tufail and Kanwal of Tando Bago also saw their families fixing their marriage in six months.
According to senior politician and social worker Mangla Sharma, who is also a part of the managing committee of the PHC, they have taken care to present the couples with things they would find essential and of use and value as they embark on a new journey in their lives.
“We are giving a silver jewellery set and a mangal sutra locket to every bride. Apart from that, each couple is being given electrical home appliances such as a washing machine, television, fan, etc. There are also cooking pots, crockery and cutlery along with clothing including their wedding clothes all gifted to them by the PHC,” said the former member of the Sindh Assembly.
Ms Sharma also pointed out that preparation for these weddings begins from way before just like one would prepare for their own children’s wedding as they go about gathering sponsors. She also said that the couples are also presented with cash from the Edhi Foundation besides the sponsors and the government.
The wedding was also attended by caretaker Information, Minority Affairs and Social Protection Minister Mohammad Ahmed Shah, who said that he had also arranged for Rs50,000 for each couple from the Sindh Government.
“This money has been paid to each couple or their families in advance so that they could prepare for this day,” he said, adding that last year this amount from the government was Rs25,000 and before that it was Rs15,000. But he doubled it this time.
He said that he was happy and proud to be given the portfolio of minorities and social protection, too, as it enabled him to help the religious minorities of the province.
“The minorities in this country have equal rights to any other citizen here. It is very sad that despite having laws to protect them incidents of forced conversions and marriages still take place here. Still, I’m not here to deliver speeches today. I’m here to congratulate these couples getting married here. I’m happy to have been invited to such a glorious occasion and wish them all the best,” he said.
PHC Patron-in-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, who has been organising the Combined Marriages Programme for 17 years now, also said that he was glad to have been of assistance to the poor families who could not afford separate weddings.

1,At crossroads: Will MQM-P boycott polls?,"Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui hints at the possibility due to ""govt machinery sabotaging electoral process"".","KARACHI: Is the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan going to boycott the Feb 8 general elections? The million-dollar question arises after party convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui hinted at the possibility during his speech at a workers’ convention late on Saturday night.
In a thinly veiled reference to the alleged support to the Pakistan Peoples’ Party from the election authorities as well as certain quarters and perturbed at its own organisational weaknesses, the MQM-P convener informed the convention that a ‘conspiracy’ had been hatched to snatch the mandate of the metropolis.
“Karachi will present a deserted look if the MQM, after watching the government machinery sabotaging the election process, showed unity and once again stage a boycott [of polls],” an MQM-P statement quoted Dr Siddiqui as telling his workers.
While the MQM-P had been winning majority seats in the previous general elections amid widespread allegations of rigging by its opponents, it had suffered a major blow in the 2018 general elections when it secured only four out of 21 National Assembly seats in Karachi.
 
 

And in January 2023, the MQM-P boycotted the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad just a couple of days before the day of polling.
Several PPP leaders have already predicted that the MQM-P would boycott the general elections on one pretext or the other. The PPP has challenged the MQM-P on many Karachi constituencies and it successfully lured its several former and disgruntled leaders into its fold.
Differences over finalisation of candidates
The latest remarks by the MQM-P chief baffled not only party workers, but also several members of the party’s coordination committee who were present in the convention and appeared visibly disturbed.
Dawn contacted many senior leaders but none of them was willing to speak on the record. They were also not fully aware of the actual reason behind Dr Siddiqui’s statement but suspected that it might be linked with the country’s political situation as well as the organisational problems. While the PPP already announced its candidates for Sindh’s national and provincial assembly seats, they said that the MQM-P was still holding deliberations to finalise a consensus list of candidates.
They said that currently the party was facing an internal crisis over distribution of tickets of the national and provincial assembly seats, especially in the constituencies considered as ‘safe’.
They said that those who came from the Pak Sarzameen Party and the group led by Dr Farooq Sattar in the MQM-P following the last year merger had filed multiple nomination papers and wanted their own loyalists to be awarded party tickets and that too from the constituencies in districts Central, Korangi and West.
Several meetings had been held but no final decision has been taken despite the fact that the last date of withdrawal of candidates is fast approaching, they said, adding that the situation has compelled the establishment to intervene and it is now clear that the final list of MQM-P’s candidates would be prepared at a ‘safe’ place and given to the senior party leadership for making a formal announcement.
They said that the MQM-P convener, already facing pressure to accommodate favourites from all sides including Governor House, which also wants MQM-P tickets for a retired government officer and an IT expert, was not happy over the ongoing row and the interference of the powers that be.
“Maybe, he [Khalid Maqbool] talked about the boycott to ease the pressure on him,” opined a source.
Besides, they said that the MQM-P believed that the caretaker government that had taken over the province’s affairs in August proved to be an extension of the PPP regime.
They said that not only the Election Commission of Pakistan, but the country’s establishment had also given a free hand to the PPP and on the other side, the MQM-P was being denied its legitimate political space.
Mentioning the rejection of nomination papers of its certain candidates from key constituencies, they alleged that most returning officers (ROs) were actually given postings by the then government of the PPP and the party feared that they might influence the election process on the day of polling in favour of the then ruling party.
Despite showing complete obedience, the discrimination against the MQM-P was ‘regretful’, the source said without elaborating further.

4,"State of human development in Sindh is exceedingly poor, moot told",Dr Hoodbhoy stresses need to inculcate critical thinking in younger generation,"KARACHI: Author Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy on Sunday regretted that the state of human development in Sindh was exceedingly poor despite the fact that the province was once far richer than present-day Bangladesh.
He expressed these views while speaking at a day-long conference, organised by the Sindhi Association of North America (SANA), on the state of human development in Sindh at the Arts Council of Pakistan. 
The inaugural session, moderated by Dr Waleed Sheikh, began with Shah Latif’s poetry rendered by Rahila Joyo followed by the launch of Shah Jo Risalo’s multilingual app developed by Raja Sand.
Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy, who was the keynote speaker for the opening session, said, “It’s a sad fact that the state of human development in Sindh is exceedingly poor. Water is stolen. Ghost schools are common. Haris are forced into serfdom. There are private jails. And our laws allow that to happen.”

Dr Hoodbhoy stresses need to inculcate critical thinking in younger generation

He said, “There was a time when Sindh per capita was far richer than Bangladesh [former East Pakistan]. Now it is far poorer. We need to ask why. There is vibrancy in society over there that one doesn’t find here [in Sindh]. At one level it is because of those who rule this country. This was always true, from 1947 onwards, but the floods of 2022 make this clearer. Part of it was natural, part human-made.”
Dr Hoodbhoy said, “Let’s look at how our political class reacted to that monster floods. Imran Khan at the time was holding great rallies in Punjab and in KP. He’d said, ‘I don’t’ have time to raise funds or to visit Sindh. Then he had to change his mind because there was so much reaction against that. Shehbaz Sharif, Bilawal Bhutto, Murad Ali Shah and others would go on helicopter trips and each trip takes about Rs300,000 per hour. They’d go to one village, get a photo-op over there, go to the next village, and have another photo-op. It was completely meaningless.”
He said, “Now let’s look what the situation is 18 months later. The infrastructure of half the schools in Sindh has still not been rebuilt. There’s water that’s still standing in places. This is nothing new. If you remember, you will recall that in 1970 a cyclone had hit East Pakistan. This was the time when Yahya Khan was the President of Pakistan and Chief of the Army Staff. The government didn’t do much. Half a million people died in that disaster. That is why East Pakistan was so angry with us.”
“Today, they take photo-ops, make helicopter trips and make their case in international conferences saying Pakistan is a victim of global warming [so] you must compensate us. They should compensate us. But get out of your land cruisers. Stop taking vacations to Dubai. Stop living in these mansions that you have. Here’s a country where the elite have captured power from the very early days of Pakistan, and they have never let go of it. Yes, the military has grabbed us by our necks. But it is also the political class and the whole structure of power that exists in our villages, in our colleges, universities, in every institution in Pakistan... It’s that way of thinking that we must change,” he added.
Expanding on the argument, Dr Hoodbhoy emphasised the need for inculcating critical thinking in the younger generation. 
In his welcome address, caretaker Information Minister Ahmed Shah, who is also the president of the Arts Council, lauded the moot’s subject and said he’s happy that SANA is working for Sindhi society. 
“Youth is the only way forward. Sindh’s youth is vibrant and IT (information technology) is important to learn. These days you can’t rely on public sector jobs because there’s so much competition. [Also], Sindhis have to work with other ethnic communities of the country,” he said. 
Acting US Consul General Jimmy Mauldin said it’s for the third time that he’s come to Pakistan and for a second time that he’s serving Sindh. 
He said that one of the reasons for coming back to the country was the warm hospitality that he received here. 
He also talked about Pak-US initiatives such as the Green Alliance to counter pressing environmental challenges. 
He added he was inspired by the music and poetry that he got to listen to in the earlier part of the programme. 
In his welcome note, SANA President Dr Maqbool Halepoto said Sindh is the land of Sufis. “We are all Sufis and Sufism is all about love. Love always unites us; hate divides us. The world has moved from agrarian to industrial to digital age. Why are we stuck with our cattle? These are the questions that need to be answered. It’s time for introspection.”

5,Beloved ex-KGS headmistress Norma Fernandes passes away,KARACHI: The smoggy gray skies over the city felt even more depressing on Sunday as generations of former Karachi...,"


 
KARACHI: The smoggy gray skies over the city felt even more depressing on Sunday as generations of former Karachi Grammar School (KGS) students woke up to the news that the former headmistress of their junior school, their beloved Mrs Norma Fernandes, had passed away.
She was suffering from several issues brought on by exceeding age. In her final days, it was also heard that she was having memory issues besides keeping frail, which was quite unbelievable in Mrs Fernandes’s case as she was particularly known to remember by name each and every child who had the good fortune to have attended school during her time. 
Having started her career as a teacher at St Patrick’s High School, Mrs Fernandes was headmistress of the KGS junior school near the Empress Market from 1966 and then of both the kindergarten and junior sections, after the school moved to Clifton, till 2009. 
She was married to one of KGS’s senior school teachers, Super Fernandes, who passed away in early 1980. Three years before her retirement, in 2006, Mrs Fernandes also took on the responsibility of school adviser, working with the KGS governing board, the principal and the internal management team, along with also giving confidential advice to parents. 
For her services to education, Mrs Fernandes was awarded the Tamgha-i-Imtiaz on March 23, 2014. 
While her exact age is not very clear, Mrs Fernandes used to say that she was born on a leap year, February 29. She often joked with students that she had also celebrated as many birthdays as them so they may consider her close to their age. Ironically, 2024 is also a leap year.

6,This week 50 years ago: Arab dignitaries and tribute to Hafeez Hoshiarpuri,"IT was a period in Pakistan’s history when, largely due to the hard work put in by its Prime Minister Z A Bhutto,...","IT was a period in Pakistan’s history when, largely due to the hard work put in by its Prime Minister Z A Bhutto, it was trying its utmost to bring the Islamic world together with renewed vigour. As a result, dignitaries from the Arab world had begun to land in Pakistan frequently. In connection with that, on Jan 8, 1974 three local religious leaders — Maulana Ehteshamul Haq Thanvi, Pir Hashim Jan and Dr Amir Ahmed — welcomed the proposal of President Idi Amin of Uganda to designate King Faisal of Saudi Arabia as the ‘leader of the Muslim world’. In a statement issued from Karachi they said the proposal truly reflected the will of Pakistanis who regard King Faisal at the centre of Islamic unity. They lauded the role that he had played in the war in the Middle East in October 1973. 
On Jan 11, the ambassador of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh Al-Khatib praised Pakistan for supporting the Arab cause claiming Pakistan had created enormous goodwill for itself among Arab countries. Speaking at an event in the city, he expressed satisfaction at Pakistan’s policy on the subject. He was of the view that the policy was based on ‘Islamic brotherhood and friendship’. 
The next day, on Jan 12, Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan Al-Qasim, brother of the Sultan of Sharjah, called on Prime Minister Z A Bhutto in the Sindh capital and discussed matters of mutual interest with him.
The week, however, began in a commemorative mood when on Jan 8 Karachi’s students observed ‘Shaheed Day’ to pay homage to the martyrs of the Jan 1953 student movement in which a number of youngsters were killed by the police. Meetings were held under the auspices of the National Students Federation (NSF), the Sindh National Students Federation (SNSF) and some other bodies in the city in which tributes were paid to those who laid down their lives defending the interest of the downtrodden in general and the student community in particular.
But how can Karachi progress in any era without its colourful cultural identity? On Jan 9, an exhibition of 128 beautiful Japanese and western flower arrangements was inaugurated at the Arts Council by Begum Abdul Hafeez Pirzada. 
And on Jan 10, poet Hafeez Hoshiarpuri’s first death anniversary was observed and his collection Muqam-i-Ghazal was launched at the same venue, the Arts Council. Presided over by Mumtaz Hasan, the programme was addressed by Air Marshal Zafar Chowdhury, Syed Hashim Raza, Shanul Haq Haqqi, Zia Jalandhri, Dr Abul Khair Kashfi and the late poet’s daughter Dr Sabiha. Mr Jalandhri said Mr Hoshiarpuri always looked for perfection. “Partly for this reason, he could not get his collection published in his lifetime.” Dr Kashfi said Mr Hoshiarpuri’s poetry reflected his personality and his deep links with the past and the present. Mr Raza said the poet was a public servant because of which he could not have opened up too much. “Even otherwise he used to say many things between the lines. The same style could be seen in his ghazals.” Dr Sabiha said apart from poems her father had left a treasure of other pieces of writing, including articles and letters.

SPLA leaders, including Munawar Abbas, demanded on Sunday strict action from the chief and provincial election commissioners against RO Muhammad Salik Naveed for allegedly taking pictures of the principle of a girls college without her permission. 
A press release said the RO had entered the Government Girls College Shah Faisal No 5 without prior information with his armed guards. When the college principal became aware of the arrival of the RO, she received him and arranged for a tour of the college. However, the next day, a show-cause notice was sent to the principal, a move that the association strongly condemned.
The SPLA called for immediate removal of the RO, accusing him of disrespecting teachers. They demanded appointing an officer with high moral standards to replace Mr Naveed.
Expressing concerns over the fulfilment of duties, the statement said, it was due to the behaviour of ROs like him that teachers from colleges in Sindh were reconsidering their participation in the election duty.
Highlighting the critical role played by the teachers in society, the association expressed concern over the mistreatment some educators face 
during the election duties. They urged the concerned authorities to address these issues.

Less than 20 hours after similar attacks by three gangs on a road leading to Kandhkot, another gang fired on trucks wounding two truck drivers and left them unattended at the site. During the shooting spree, they overpowered nine other drivers and cleaners and took them away into the riverine area of Kashmore, other truckers told the area police. 
Bullets hit a number of vehicles, including passenger coaches and trucks and container-mounted heavy vehicles, they said, adding that the dacoits were in a large number and had suddenly appeared from the woods. They first targeted tyres of the moving vehicles forcing them to stop.  
The truckers said that before abducting crews of some vehicles, the dacoits robbed occupants of the stuck up vehicles of their belongings and money.
After receiving information about the incident, Kashmore SSP Bashir Brohi along with a strong contingent of police force drawn from different stations Rangers personnel arrived at the site and went after the gang.
The police transported the wounded drivers to the Kashmore Civil Hospital, where doctors refferred them to a major hospital in Rahim Yar Khan.

11,Rs48.32bn   project disturbed by repeated collapse of old structure,Flows released to Johi on temporary basis but chief engineers say arrangement not dependable,"HYDERABAD: Water flows to Johi taluka of Dadu district from old aqueduct of Kari Mori have been released after another major repair work but irrigation officials say these supplies are not dependable. 
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of Sindh Irrigation Secretary Dr Niaz Abbasi which emphasised the need for completion of the ongoing work for a new aqueduct at RD-210 of the Main Nara Valley (MNV) drain and RD-77 of Johi branch by Feb 28.
Work for the new aqueduct is being carried out at a cost of Rs48.327 billion under the Sindh Flood Emergency Rehabilitation (SFERP), whose project director Javed Memon and Sukkur Barrage’s right and left bank chief engineer Sohail Hameed Baloch also attended the meeting.
Mr Memon told the meeting that “the work is of quite typical nature”, and said it was very difficult to set a date for its completion at this stage as per the proposed timelines based on agreements with contractors. Under the agreements, the work has to be completed by June 30. 
Day and night work advised
The irrigation secretary called for accelerating the pace by carrying out the work day and night to meet the deadlines set according to the timeline. Mr Memon said he had already conveyed this point to the contractors telling them to complete their works by March 30.

Flows released to Johi on temporary basis but chief engineers say arrangement not dependable

Mr Baloch said efforts were being made to ensure water supplies to Johi taluka through aqueduct and a technical team had ensured water flows at low gauge to meet growers’ water requirement. 
Mr Baloch had earlier informed the irrigation secretary that water supply had been restored to Johi on Jan 1. He had clearly mentioned that it was a temporary arrangement in view of “deplorable condition of the old aqueduct”.
Repair work report submitted
Meanwhile, a two-page report was said to have been submitted to the irrigation secretary on his directive by CE Sohail Baloch and chief engineer development (region-I) Mansoor Memon following their visit to the old aqueduct in the wake of a recent rupture in its structure. It was mentioned in the report that the site was examined twice thoroughly and the CEs were satisfied that the repair work done for a second time was intact. “But water flowed underneath the sheet piling work,” they maintained, and said that the sheet piling methodology was adopted to avoid wastage of water into the MNV drain but this time, after preventive measures, water passed through C-Section of piling work and from right side of earthen bank of Johi branch only to fall into the drain.
Reasons for back-to-back collapse
The report said that aqueduct had collapsed in Sept 2022 when huge quantum of floodwaters from Balochistan had hit Sindh. Detailing the reasons leading to the back-to-back collapse of repair works at the old aqueduct, the chief engineers proposed that as an alternative arrangement to provide immediate remedy, a dyke may be provided across the under-construction new aqueduct which may stipulate way for execution of construction work with an accelerated pace. On the other hand, they said, water level in the MNV drain would improve and facilitate working levels at the existing pumping station. So, pumping station would provide water to growers of Johi branch, they explained.
They recommended that the ongoing work for the new aqueduct could be expedited on a war footing without interval as no other option was left for a permanent solution to ensure regular water supply to the growers. 
Water quality test
The CEs, in the report proposed a water quality test as well saying that if it happened to be unfit for irrigation, then freshwater should be mixed in it Johi upstream.
The Sindh High Court, Hyderabad circuit bench, is also set to hear the case of water supplies to Johi and the work on the aqueduct on Jan 17. 
The bench had on Dec 19, 2023 expected that water supply would be restored in view of the timeline as conveyed to court. CE Hameed Baloch had appeared before the bench.

14,Hesco set to provide loadshedding-free supply to small industries,HYDERABAD: Chief executive officer of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) Bashir Ahmed has said that...,"HYDERABAD: Chief executive officer of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) Bashir Ahmed has said that directives have been issued for the bifurcation of feeders in the city and ensure completion of the work before inception of summer season. 
He said that express feeders would be provided to small industries as had been got approved by the Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) president Adeel Siddiqui from the Ministry of Energy.
After the process, a loadshedding-free power supply to small industries would be ensured.
The Hesco chief was addressing HCCI members at a reception hosted here in his honour on Saturday. 
He said that directives were also issued for the replacement of obsolete lines and transformers. He said consumers would certainly get relief on their genuine complaints of detection bills.
He said that dispute resolution committee having representatives of Hesco and HCCI was being formed to address complaints of inflated bills. He said that this committee would decide cases on consumers’ complaint. Hesco was committed to end the kunda culture, he said, and urged consumers to be honest being major stakeholders. He said the industrial sector was backbone of the national economy.
He agreed with HCCI about problems faced by businessmen and industrialists, saying that sub-divisional officers (SDOs) were given online briefing by the Hesco management so that consumers’ problems could be resolved timely. He said business community must be thankful to HCCI president who got approval for the installation of express feeder for small industries. He promised that a loadshedding-free power supply to small industries would be ensured within three days after shifting of industries to the express feeders. 
He said Hesco is allocating 200 transformers for HCCI which would be installed in trade centres and industrial estate in a phase manner.
Earlier, HCCI president Adeel Siddiqui welcomed Hesco chief and said  Pakistan was facing energy crisis and industrial sector was in deep  trouble. 
He said business community was contributing 34pc of Hesco’s revenue  yet problems of industrial and commercial consumers were not resolved. 
He emphasised that complaints of traders must be resolved on a  daily basis as complaints against Hesco had been abound. He extended chamber’s  cooperation to Hesco chief on payment of power bills but unannounced  shutdown had made industrial production and business really difficult. He drew Hesco CEO’s attention towards bifurcation of feeders as  promised by his predecessor but it was not implemented to date. 
HCCI chief patron Ikram Rajput said Hesco should concentrate on  addressing business community’s power-related problems to keep  industrial production going. 
HCCI’s senior vice president Najmuddin Qureshi and chairman of its subcommittee on Hesco Akbar Durrani also spoke.
