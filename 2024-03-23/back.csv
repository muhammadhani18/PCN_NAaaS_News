2,"US urged Ukraine to halt strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, FT reports",Attacks helped boost oil prices that have risen nearly 4% so far since March 12,"The United States has urged Ukraine to halt strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, warning that drone strikes risk provoking retaliation and driving up global oil prices, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The attacks helped boost oil prices that have risen nearly 4% so far since March 12, when Ukraine first started targeting Russia's energy infrastructure. A further rally in gasoline prices in the United States would weaken President Joe Biden ratings and undermine his re-election chances.
Russia and Ukraine have both used drones to strike critical infrastructure, military installations and troop concentrations in their more than two-year war, with Kyiv hitting Russian refineries and energy facilities in recent months.

3,Pakistan launches bid for UNSC seat for 2025-26,UNGA president lauds Pakistan’s commitment to multilateralism," 
Pakistan has formally launched its bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for a two year term from 2025 to 2026 with the promise of contributing meaningfully to the council’s mandate for international peace and security.
Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to UN Ambassador Munir Akram formally announced Pakistan’s candidacy at a well-attended reception at the UN on Thursday held in connection with the Pakistan Day celebrations.
The reception at the Pakistani Mission to the UN in New York, was attended UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Dennis Francis, top diplomats from the UN permanent missions, officials, members of academia, media, civil society organisations and the Pakistani diaspora.
Speaking on the occasion, Akram underscored Pakistan’s consistent efforts to champion the causes of the Global South and promote cooperative multilateralism. He also highlighted Pakistan’s contributions to the UN and several notable achievements.
Seeking support from the international community for Pakistan’s UNSC bid, Ambassador Akram expressed confidence in Pakistan’s ability to contribute meaningfully to the UNSC’s mandate for international peace and security.
“Pakistan’s foreign policy is rooted in the principles of the UN Charter, including the non-use or threat of force in international relation, respect for sovereignty, and territorial integrity, right to self-determination and non-interference in internal affairs of states,” Akram said.
He mentioned Pakistan’s services on key UN bodies, including the UNSC, Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Human Rights Council and Group of 77 besides the country’s significant contributions to UN peacekeeping missions, with over 200,000 service members, serving in 46 missions worldwide.
Speaking as the chief guest at the reception, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Dennis Francis lauded Pakistan’s “steadfast, devoted and robust commitment” to multilateralism, and its significant contributions to various UN bodies and platforms.
“Pakistan’s journey has been punctuated by remarkable achievements and an unwavering spirit expressed in the resilience of its people,” Francis said. He underscored Pakistan’s consistent efforts to champion the causes of the Global South and promote cooperative multilateralism.
“I take this opportunity to applaud Pakistan’s consistent work – working alongside the membership of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation [OIC] – to elevate the concern about Islamophobia. “Pakistan’s Ecosoc presidency in 2021… successfully achieved a consensus on debt relief and restructuring.”

4,IMF proposes reviving 18% GST on petrol,There is also a proposal to gradually increase excise duty on luxury items produced in Pakistan,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recommended reinstating an 18% general sales tax (GST) on petrol during the ongoing discussions with the government for the release of the last tranche of its bailout package.
According to Express News, the IMF has proposed increasing the levy on petrol by Rs60 and reinstating the 18% GST previously abolished in March 2022.
The amount of federal excise duty on petroleum products in the fiscal year 2023 was 0.7% of the GDP, while for other items, it was 0.4% of the GDP, mainly obtained from the federal excise duty on cigarettes.
The Petroleum Development Levy has undergone several changes in recent years, but there was a significant increase in it in fiscal year 2023.
In July 2022, the rate of petroleum levy on petrol was Rs20 per liter, which was increased to Rs50 per liter from November 2022, and further raised to Rs60 per liter until September 2023.
Whether local or international projects, the IMF has proposed imposing the Petroleum Development Levy on machinery that pollutes the environment.
It has been proposed to gradually increase excise duty on luxury items produced in the country, such as yachts, while enhancing border control. This is aimed at preventing the illegal supply of petroleum byproducts from sensitive areas in particular.
According to reports, an increase in federal excise duty (FED) at a uniform rate on domestically manufactured cigarettes has been recommended by the IMF. There is also a proposal to apply the same tax rate to imported cigarettes as local cigarettes.

6,Naran avalanche damages eight hotels,Road to Saiful Malook Lake closed at multiple locations," 
More than eight hotels were damaged after a massive glacier skidded onto the road near the famous Saiful Malook Lake, as more details of the avalanche in the hill resort of Naran, in the Mansehra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, emerged on Friday, officials at the Kaghan Development Authority (KDA) said.
They said that the Jheel Road, which leads from Naran to the fabled lake, was closed at four places, while there was a high risk of further avalanches. Though the reports from the area were sketchy, initial estimates of the damages suggest that at least eight hotels sustained damage.
Naran in the upper Kaghan Valley is one of the most popular tourist attractions locally as well as internationally. It is the most visited valley in Pakistan in the summer season. The area becomes almost empty in winters because of severe cold, road closures and snowfall.
On Thursday, the KDA officials had said that several hotels were buried under the avalanche because of the collapse of Ghamla and Chapran glaciers on Jheel Road. They added that a team had been formed to get the initial assessment of the damage and report back.
“According to preliminary reports, around eight hotels and nearby structures along the streams are damaged after the glacier fell on Lake Saiful Muluk Road yesterday [Thursday],” a KDA officials told The Express Tribune. “However, the Naran Bazaar is safe,” he added.
The officials said that it was difficult to get the exact damage assessment because of a lack of access to the area as the Kaghan highway was closed for the past five months because of winter snow. The road was expected to open next month after snow melting.
Glacier collapse is common in the Kaghan Valley in the winters. In the current year, the valley received record snowfall. As a result, according to the officials, the grounds of Naran were still under three feet of snow, while its surrounding mountains were covered in up to five feet of white.
The tourism season in Naran continues from April till September-October. After the season ends, the population of Naran moves to the lower areas, and no tourists or individuals stayed behind in the valley. Therefore, there was no report of human casualties in the avalanche.
“The recent inclement weather conditions have triggered more avalanches,” KDA Director General Shabir Khan said. However, Khan emphasised that there was no emergency situation in the valley that could cause distress. The officials said that there was no need, so far, to mount a rescue operation there.

7,"Will move ECP, court for K-P Assembly session: PPP",Kundi says provincial govt avoiding swearing-in of reserved seat MPAs," 
The PPP on Friday announced that it would approach the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and court to convene a meeting of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, PPP leader Faisal Karim Kundi said the K-P government was in a state of confusion and it was not calling the assembly session to avoid the administration of oath to MPAs allocated reserved seats.
Kundi maintained that K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur delivered bold dialogues outside but begged in front of PM Shehbaz Sharif when he was inside the latter’s office.
Kundi said his party wanted good relations between the province and federation.
The PPP leader said the process of government formation would be completed after the Senate elections.
“The ruling alliance will emerge victorious in the Senate polls,” he added.
He pointed out that the budget had to be announced and the government would approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) again.
However, he continued that the government would try to provide relief to the people.
Talking about the growing terrorism in the country, Kundi said the government had repeatedly sent a message to Afghanistan that its soil was being used against Pakistan. “We cannot tolerate it anymore. We want good ties with our neighbours but this does not mean that you hand over your land to our enemies.”
In a related development, sources said K-P governor Haji Ghulam Ali met Gandapur in Islamabad.
They added that the meeting which took place at the K-P House lasted for more than an hour.
The sources said Ghulam Ali and Gandapur discussed the reserved seats, oath-taking of MNAs and K-P’s resources.
They continued that the governor urged the CM to work together on constitutional issues.

8,EASA clearance to sweeten PIA sell-off,Asif says agency likely allow ops around mid-May," 
As the authorities take strides towards privatisation of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan has set its sights on securing clearance from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in a bid to lure top-notch bids for the national carrier.
During a high-level chaired by Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday, the minister hinted at the possibility of EASA's nod coming around mid-May this year.
Asif highlighted that the green light from the international agency would significantly enhance the appeal and value of the national carrier, attracting potential investors.
The meeting, attended by key figures from the aviation, privatisation, and finance divisions, delved into the prospects of resuming flights to the UK.
The hope surfaces amid the aftermath of EASA's embargo on the airline's operations to lucrative European routes and the UK, following the tragic crash in Karachi that claimed nearly 100 lives in 2020. Subsequently, a scandal over fake pilot licenses further exacerbated the situation.
The ban's bite has cost PIA a hefty Rs40 billion annually, as per official figures disclosed in the parliament.
Despite PIA's pleas to EASA to lift the embargo, the silence from the European front has remained deafening. However, reports recently indicated that there was optimism in the PIA administration that flights to Europe and the UK would resume this year, anticipating a favourable decision from the EASA Safety Review Board.

Meanwhile, it was revealed during the meeting that the gears have also started turning on PIA's privatisation.
Discussions during the meeting centred on addressing hurdles in the privatisation process, debt restructuring with commercial banks, a six-month cash flow strategy, and delineating operational responsibilities.
Emphasizing the imperative of swift privatisation, Privatisation Minister Abdul Aleem Khan underscored the critical role of timely decisions in achieving substantial success in business.
In a parallel development, the Ministry of Aviation issued a gazette notification greenlighting the establishment of a holding company, a move aimed at alleviating PIA's financial burdens.
According to PIA sources, following the gazette notification, the company will be formally registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) under the banner of PIA Holding Company Limited.
