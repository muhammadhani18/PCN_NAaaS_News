0,Funding delay mars heritage restoration efforts,"Rawalpindi’s rich cultural heritage, including the iconic Haveli Sujan Singh, awaits revival","The Rawalpindi district administration has decided to pitch the renovation project of 132-year-old Haveli Sujan Singh, seven historical gurdwaras and one temple to the newly elected Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
The Punjab government approved the project four years ago, with an estimated cost of Rs240 million. The project has been delayed for four years due to the non-availability of funds. After renovation, the historic gurdwaras and temples, including Haveli Sujan Singh, will be opened to tourists.
Talking to The Express Tribune, a senior district administration official stated while requesting anonymity that former commissioner Captain (retd) Muhammad Mehmood had obtained approval for the project from the Punjab government in 2020.
Due to improper maintenance, the 132-year-old Haveli Sujan Singh—a significant cultural heritage site—has crumbled into ruin.
The former Rawalpindi commissioner had taken approval from the Punjab government to renovate Haveli Sujan Singh to preserve this heritage and introduce its history to tourists. The project included the renovation of the Haveli, including the historic seven gurdwaras and a temple around the Haveli.
According to the officer, the project’s goal was to transform the historic streets of the inner Bhabra Bazaar into walking streets, in which the balconies of all the ancient buildings were to be painted with colourful patterns.
The plan included establishing a library on the ground floor of Haveli Sujan Singh, which would store historical books. On the top floor, however, a restaurant will be constructed where visitors may sit and have tea while learning about the Haveli’s history.
The plan involved relocating electricity poles, telephones and other wires installed in the streets near Haveli Sajjan Singh to restore some of the old scenery. Although it was also part of the plan to establish a museum on the second level of Haveli. This museum was to house artefacts pertaining to the Sikh and British Raj.
Sources said despite the project’s approval, the Rawalpindi administration will not pay the amount required to start the project. The lack of funding causes the project to be postponed continuously.
A Sikh family-owned Haveli Sujan Singh, they left this Haveli at the time of the partition and migrated to India. This family also owned the Badshahi Mahal on Mall Road, which currently houses the Fatima Jinnah Women’s University.
Before this project, the plan to make Haveli Sajan Singh a campus of Fatima Jinnah University was also under consideration, however, it could not be implemented due to various reasons.
Haveli Sujan Singh consists of 45 large rooms, which is associated with witnessing British architectural style. Its balconies have wooden arches and doors that relate to the view. The purpose of opening this mansion for tourists was not only to preserve the cultural heritage and introduce it to the next generations but also to promote the Potohar culture, which has been delayed due to a lack of funds.
Regarding the delay of the Haveli Sujan Singh revamp project, the district administration stated that the newly elected Chief Minister, Maryam Nawaz, is giving great importance to the historical buildings.
The Rawalpindi district administration will try to implement the project of the present Punjab chief minister to secure the cultural buildings; a lot of work has already been done on this project.
“Buildings associated with cultural heritage are our hallmark, and we will also ensure their safety. The homework for this project has been completed; the only thing lacking is funding, which will be addressed with every effort,” the official said.

1,RDA hints at action against WASA defaulters,Huddle agrees to seek police assistance in recovering dues,"The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has said it is intensifying its efforts to address various issues related to Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) defaulters and illegal housing schemes in the city.
The latest development includes a crackdown on defaulters, with a firm stance on bill payments and recovery of property taxes.
In a high-level meeting, RDA Director General Kinza Murtaza announced that FIRs would be filed against WASA defaulters, eliminating the option of paying bills in instalments. Customers are now required to submit the entire bill amount, and an SMS system will be introduced for bill notifications.
Additionally, the RDA will seek police assistance for recovering dues from defaulters and ensure that property transfers are subject to WASA's NOC.
Moreover, the RDA plans to conduct surveys of tube wells in both sanctioned and illegal housing schemes within a week.
Monthly water charges from the private housing scheme for tube wells will be collected as well. A Business Facilitation Centre has been established to streamline processes, including obtaining NOCs from WASA before property sales, which is expected to boost WASA's income and financial stability.
In an introductory meeting with journalists, RDA DG Kinza Murtaza said a zero-tolerance policy would be adopted against illegal housing schemes, with discussions underway to halt utilities like electricity, gas, telephone, and water connections to these schemes. She said the agency’s complaint cell will be activated to address grievances and illegal water hydrants will be eliminated in favour of approved ones adhering to WASA's tariff.
Furthermore, RDA plans to launch a Rain Harvesting Project to conserve water, connect mosques and government offices to rainwater harvesting systems, and introduce water-saving measures like connecting wash basins to toilet systems. Illegal housing projects will face strict action, including the cessation of advertising and the demolition of marketing offices.
Kinza Murtaza emphasised the importance of ensuring water quality, mentioning plans to test water sold by companies in the open market for contamination. Selling harmful water under the guise of mineral water will not be permitted, safeguarding citizens' health.
She said these measures will highlight RDA's commitment to improving water management, addressing illegal housing issues, and promoting sustainable practices for the benefit of Rawalpindi's residents.

5,College officials in Islamabad face action over harassment allegations,"Accused, including Principal Aftab Tariq, have been relieved from their positions","The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training took disciplinary action against the Principal and other officials of Islamabad Model College for Boys (IMCB) F-7/3, following substantiated allegations of harassment and misconduct.
According to a notification, the accused officers, including Aftab Tariq, Principal of the College, along with Umme Rubab Headmistress, Mateen Ahmed Acting Principal and Khalida Asif ex-drawing & disbursing officer have been made dysfunctional from their positions of authority.
Furthermore, they have been barred from holding any future administrative roles within the educational department.
The move comes in response to a joint complaint lodged by four daily-wage female teachers of IMCB F-7/3 in October 2023. Madad Ali Sindhi, the former minister, demonstrated swift attention to the matter, directing the education ministry to form an inquiry committee to investigate the allegations against the accused officers.
The inquiry committee facilitated a hearing for the victimized teachers on October 25, 2023, providing them with an opportunity to voice their grievances and concerns. The inquiry report, dated December 4, 2023, highlighted Aftab Tariq’s disregard for established procedures and his unilateral decision-making, leading to chaos and embarrassment within the ministry.
It was alarming when Aftab Tariq issued illegal verbal orders for the termination of all daily-wage teachers further worsening tensions among staff members. The inquiry committee’s findings substantiated the claims of harassment and the ministry has directed the Federal Directorate of Education to dysfunction the accused officers from their administrative positions.
Warning letters have already been issued to them. The warning letter issued to Aftab Tariq cited evidence of autocratic behaviour, harassment, and misuse of authority. The investigation revealed troubling signs of a narcissistic personality of Aftab Tariq, characterised by bursts of anger and inappropriate conduct towards employees.
The ministry has directed the Federal Directorate of Education to ensure compliance with the disciplinary measures and submit a report within 48 hours.

6,"Earth Hour 2024: Lights out, hope in",WWF’s event brings together millions worldwide for the planet’s biggest hour,"WWF’s Earth Hour, the world’s largest grassroots environmental movement, made its 18th annual return with the ‘Biggest Hour for Earth’ on March 23, spotlighting global support and celebration for our planet.
As the world grapples with various environmental challenges and increasing divisions, Earth Hour serves as a symbol of optimism, unity, and motivation, aiming to engage those who may not yet be fully involved in addressing these pressing issues.
Originating in 2007, Earth Hour has been distinguished by its symbolic “lights off” moment. With landmarks and households worldwide dimming their lights, participants are encouraged to ‘Give an hour for Earth’, dedicating 60 minutes to positive actions for our environment.
Last year, over 410,000 hours were collectively pledged to our planet by supporters across 190 countries and territories, representing 90 per cent of the global community, marking it as the Biggest Hour for Earth.
Notable landmarks in Pakistan, including the President House, Parliament House, Pak-China Friendship Centre, Convention Centre, Election Commission of Pakistan, and various corporate offices, joined in by switching off their lights to express commitment to the cause.
In observance of Earth Hour, President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan emphasised the severe challenge that climate change poses to social, environmental, and economic development, particularly in third-world countries like Pakistan. He highlighted the visible impacts of global climate change, such as increased droughts, floods, erratic weather patterns, reduced freshwater supply, and loss of biodiversity.
Hammad Naqi Khan, Director General of WWF-Pakistan, highlighted Pakistan’s ranking among the top ten countries most severely affected by climate change.
Recalling the widespread rains and devastating floods of 2022, which claimed over 1700 lives and caused significant economic and infrastructural damage, Khan stressed the urgent need for a climate-resilient development model, nature-based solutions, and the conservation of energy and water resources.
Renowned TV actress and WWF-Pakistan Goodwill Ambassador Ushna Shah reflected on Earth Hour’s longstanding role as a symbol of hope for the planet. She noted its alignment with Pakistan Day, urging people to participate and create the Biggest Hour for Earth, emphasising the positivity of dedicating 60 minutes to benefit the planet.
Adventure athlete Samar Khan echoed the sentiment that Earth Hour is more than simply turning off lights; it’s about uniting for our shared home. Encouraging citizens to join the event, Khan emphasised that there’s something for everyone, whether they are foodies, fitness enthusiasts, entertainment lovers, or seeking quality family time. She stressed that every small action contributes to the cause.
