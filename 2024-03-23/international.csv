0,Vaccine shortage stalls beef export,Meat trade encounters complex challenges due to inadequate inoculation of cattle,"With infectious ailments like the fog fever, lumpy skin disease and foot and mouth disease afflicting cattle throughout the province, the quality of red meat sold across Lahore has become increasingly dubious with the passage of time however, while the local consumers might have been inured to the substandard animal protein on their plates, earning the approbation of international export partners is no easy feat.
Although the demand for red meat produced in Pakistan is pretty high especially in blooming economies like China, the high prevalence of the foot and mouth disease among local livestock alongside a shortage of the relevant vaccine has raised concerns among foreign stakeholders, who are sceptical about purchasing meat and other animal based products made in Pakistan, thereby reducing their exports to a great extent.
The foot and mouth disease or FMD, which is a fairly common ailment afflicting cattle including buffaloes and cows, infects the skin between the animal's mouth and hooves, causing blisters to form on the tongue, palate, and gums. These blisters not only cause the sick animal to develop a high fever but they also disrupt the feeding patterns and reduce milk production.
According to Dr Muhammad Iqbal Shahid, Chief Veterinary Officer and Director General (Extension) of the Department of Livestock and Dairy Development Punjab, viruses like the pestedespetits ruminants (PPR), Newcastle disease (ND) and the foot and mouth disease (FMD) have caused the most harm to cattle in the country but their incidence could not be controlled due to a lack of health resources like vaccines.
""The department currently requires 110 million doses of the vaccine against foot-and-mouth disease, while only 9 million doses are imported, and 9 million doses are being produced locally. We are facing a shortage of approximately 92 million doses. Furthermore, even though the population of cattle is increasing by 6 per cent each year, there are only 2400 veterinary doctors to take care of the health of animals. In other words, only one doctor and two paravets are available for examining 20,000 animals,"" disclosed Dr Shahid.
Concurring with Dr Shahid on the importance of monitoring the health of livestock, Dr Manouchhar, a zoologist elucidated that there are two types of diseases commonly spread among animals.
""There are those which only affect animals while others like the foot and mouth disease, can be transmitted to humans,"" informed Dr Manouchhar.
Naseem Ahmad Saifi, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Halal Food Import and Export and the All Pakistan Meat Processors and Export Association, revealed that only one FMD free zone was present in Punjab's Bahawalpur for reviewing the health status of livestock, while another disease-free compartment had been created with the support of China in Sheikhupura.
""Even though there are no barriers in exporting meat to the Gulf countries, China, which is our target market, only accepts FMD free meat. In order to im-
prove our access to the Chinese market, we must control FMD and improve our animal identification process. Otherwise, FMD is a major obstacle in the export of meat to countries which have a big market for Pakistani buffalo's frozen meat."" explained Dr Saifi. Dr Saifi's assertion is supported by sources from Livestock Punjab, which reveal that meat worth 500 million dollars is exported from Pakistan, out of which 60 per cent of the revenue is generated from production in Punjab's provincial capital, Lahore. Furthermore, boiled meat worth 20 million dollars has been exported to China during the last two are months, and these figures expected to reach 60 million dollars by the end of the next financial year.

2,Demand for imported wheat plummets,Flour price drops after arrival of fresh produce from Sindh,"The imported wheat market has crashed after flour mills of Punjab reduced its purchase by 90 per cent because the grain grown in Sindh became cheaper.
The price of imported wheat has decreased by Rs160 and the domestic produce by Rs400 per maund.
On the other hand, farmers' organisations have demanded that the federal government should not extend for the third time the deadline of March 31 for ships arriving with imported wheat. They said the lenience would cause irreparable loss to the farmers as the indigenous wheat had started coming to the market.
After the reduction in wheat prices, the price of a 20kg flour bag in Punjab has dropped by Rs80, while further reduction is expected in coming days.
Meanwhile, the final announcement will be made next week regarding the government procurement of wheat in Punjab. The procurement target will be decided by the provincial cabinet, which could be between two million and three million tonnes.
Also, the food department has suggested that the area limit for wheat bag acquisition should be set at 10 acres.
It suggested that not more than 60 jute or 120 PP bags should be issued to a person. The delivery charges to farmers should be reduced from Rs60 to Rs30 per sack.
The department has prepared a mobile application for purchasing wheat as well as issuing the sacks.
The Punjab Food Department is estimated to have a carry-forward stock of around two million tonnes of wheat.
In another development, the food secretary has taken notice of the spoilage of wheat kept in government godowns in various districts and strict departmental action is likely in this regard.
Regarding the concerns of the growers, farmers' organisations say that if the purchase of wheat by the food department and flour mills is reduced, the prices of newly harvested wheat in Punjab may crash to as low as Rs3,300 per maund.
According to sources, there has been a significant increase in the arrival of fresh wheat from Sindh to Punjab, as well as a decrease in the arrival of imported wheat from Karachi.
In a few days,.the price of imported wheat sold in Lahore has decreased from Rs4,240 to Rs4,060 per maund and the produce of Sindh from Rs4,400 to Rs4,010, which is likely to decrease further.
The sources said flour mills in Karachi were getting imported wheat at Rs3,680 per maund, due to which they were not buying the wheat from Sindh, which, instead, was coming to Punjab.
Due to the continuous decrease in wheat prices, the prices of 20kg bags of flour in Punjab have come down significantly during the past two days. A bag sold for Rs2,640 to Rs2,750 has become cheaper by Rs80, while further reduction is expected.
According to the sources, after the formation of the Cabinet Committee for Wheat next week, the issue of government purchase of wheat will be presented to the provincial cabinet for a final decision.
The sources said it appeared that the food department would only purchase up to two million tonnes of wheat as it has a carry-forward stock of over two million tonnes, but the Punjab government will decide on the purchase targets.
So far, the food department has released 1.7 million tonnes of wheat to flour mills, which is less than last year's figure. The release has decreased due to import and higher price.
In previous years, the department gave sacks for wheat procurement to farmers without any consideration of the cultivated area, but this time it has been proposed that those the limit should be 10 acres.
Similarly, in the past, a maximum of 200 sacks were given to a farmer. It is now proposed to be reduced to 60 sacks.
The sources added that Food Secretary Moazzam Sipra, after inspection in different districts, has decided to take action against those responsible for spoilage of government wheat in godowns. He directed all the field officers to visit each godown and submit a report.
Meanwhile, farmers' organizations claimed that instead of 2.4 million tonnes, 3.1 million tonnes of wheat had been imported.
Now that the new wheat crop is ready, extending the date for bringing imported wheat for the third time would cause economic exploitation of the farmers, a representative of an organisation said.

3,"FIA busts fake medicine racket, arrests two suspects",Large chemical manufacturing warehouse unearthed in Kot Radha Kishan,"FIA Lahore has apprehended two individuals involved in the production and distribution of counterfeit medications, seizing substantial quantities of anti-cancer, herbal, veterinary, and other drugs from their possession.
The crackdown, initiated on the instructions of Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi, is part of a broader effort to combat the proliferation of fake medicines.
Provincial Health Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir and Lahore FIA Director Sarfraz Khan Virk disclosed these details during a joint press conference. They revealed that a task force comprising FIA and Health Department teams had dismantled a significant network dealing in fake anti-cancer and herbal medications.
Led by Deputy Director Mian Muhammad Sabir, the operation resulted in the arrest of Tashfeen Ahmed and Akbar Khan, who were involved in the illicit sale of anti-cancer and life-saving drugs. The accused conducted transactions in cash or through bank accounts, engaging in this illegal trade for over a year.
Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir emphasised the ongoing collaboration with FIA to crackdown on counterfeit medication producers across Punjab.
He vowed strict action against those manufacturing unauthorized allopathic medicines, especially those masquerading as herbal medicine manufacturers.
It was noted that medicines lacking Form 7 authoridation from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) are deemed illegal.
Additionally, FIA uncovered a large chemical manufacturing warehouse in Kot Radha Kishan, where significant supplies used in medicine production were seized.
Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir affirmed continued operations in partnership with FIA, framing the fight against counterfeit medicines as a form of jihad.
A hotline will soon be established to facilitate citizen reporting of fake medicines, ensuring informant anonymity.
In parallel, efforts are underway to combat electricity theft, with proposals to reward individuals who report such illegal activity.

4,Political bickering derails budget discussion in PA,"Treasury, Opposition lawmakers engage in heated exchanges","The second day of the general discussion on the annual budget 2023-24 in the legislative assembly witnessed heated debates and a lack of focus as both treasury and opposition lawmakers engaged in blame games regarding the country's economic woes, inflation and sectorial destruction.
Lawmakers from both sides diverted from the core topic, delving into discussions about various unrelated issues such as Adiyala Jail, allegations of corruption, religious rulings, past riots, and administrative matters instead of providing constructive criticism on the budget or proposing strategies for its improvement.
Opposition members criticised the budget, highlighting its shortcomings and proposing corrective measures to steer different sectors in the right direction. Conversely, treasury legislators defended the budget initially, urging the government to prioritize addressing other pressing issues they deemed essential.
The discussion frequently veered off track and became contentious, particularly when a PMLN lawmaker labeleld a prisoner from Adiyala Jail (allegedly referring to Imran Khan) as a ‘traitor’.
This led to chants and counter-chants between the opposition and treasury benches, resulting in disruptions to the proceedings.
After objectionable remarks were expunged from the record, Opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar cautioned that his party's members might lose patience if the situation persisted.
Highlighting various concerns, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawmaker Zakia Shahnawaz called for unity among lawmakers from both sides to focus on national interests instead of engaging in political mudslinging.
The session also saw discussions on religious issues, community grievances, and proposals for combating corruption and improving various sectors including health, education, and agriculture.
While opposition lawmakers critiqued the budget, highlighting loopholes and proposing sectoral improvements, treasury legislators defended it and called for attention to other pressing issues.
The discourse often derailed, with tensions escalating, particularly when accusations were hurled at prominent figures.
Despite efforts to maintain order, objectionable language led to disruptions, prompting warnings from opposition leaders. Concerns were raised about the constitutionality of passing the budget under a caretaker government, adding fuel to the already fiery debate.
Agriculture emerged as a focal point, with lawmakers emphasizing the need for comprehensive policies to address issues like wheat shortages and farmer welfare. Criticism of past governance and calls for anti-corruption measures underscored the deep-seated issues facing the nation.
While some lawmakers urged unity and cooperation to steer the country forward, others exploited religious and community issues for political gain.
Graveyard shortages for minority communities and calls for legislative action against corruption further added to the complexity of discussions.
Despite the chaos, calls for progress in healthcare, education, sanitation, and other sectors resonated among lawmakers. However, the session concluded with no tangible resolutions, highlighting the challenges in steering the nation towards stability and development.
In his closing remarks, Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan adjourned the House until March 25, urging lawmakers to work collaboratively towards the betterment of the country.

6,‘Defiant’ school principal faces action over TV interview,His defiance of orders has led education authorities to pursue departmental proceedings against him,"Principal of Government Crescent Model Higher Secondary School Mahboob Alam has stirred controversy by speaking out against district education authorities in a recent TV interview.
His defiance of orders has led education authorities to pursue departmental proceedings against him.
Alam's interview shed light on his refusal to comply with directives from district education officers, who were allegedly pressuring him to compel teachers and students to participate in rallies, seminars, and walks organised by higher education authorities as part of the ""Suthra Punjab"" campaign initiated by the Chief Minister of Punjab on March 3.
He recounted an incident where he reluctantly sent two teachers and 15 students to participate in a cycle rally, resulting in a student getting severely injured.
Alam argued that such activities were disrupting students' focus on preparing for intermediate and secondary board examinations, causing mental stress for both students and teachers.
Feeling mentally strained by the repeated demands from education authorities, Alam took the unprecedented step of sending a letter via the Prime Minister's portal to address the issue, specifically targeting Iftikhar Khan, the District Education Officer, urging him to cease organizing rallies and allowing schools to focus on education.
In response to Alam's defiance, the District Secondary Education Officer has forwarded a complaint to the Secretary of Education in Punjab, recommending disciplinary action against the principal for violating government servant rules and the Punjab Government Employees Efficiency and Disciplinary Act 2006.
The officer has proposed initiating a regular inquiry into Alam's conduct, suggesting that the government consider terminating his services due to misconduct.
