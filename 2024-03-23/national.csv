0,$300m Panda bonds planned,"Aim is to tap into Chinese market, diversify funding sources","Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced on Friday that Pakistan will introduce Panda bonds worth $300 million into the Chinese market this year.
According to details, the finance minister stated that Pakistan will enter the Chinese markets for bond sales for the first time. Initially, bonds worth between $250 to $300 million will be offered, with plans for further issuances in the future.
“We should have considered this some time ago,” he admitted. “China boasts the second-largest and most extensive bond market globally, making it a strategic move for our country to explore this market. Considering that Pakistan has already issued dollar and eurobonds, tapping into the Chinese market is the logical next step.”

In his remarks on the country’s economy, he highlighted the government’s robust cash balances and assured that all loans are anticipated to be repaid on schedule. He expressed confidence that loan repayments will not exert pressure on the currency. Aurangzeb further mentioned that the rupee is expected to remain stable in the near future, adding that Pakistan intends to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a minimum of three years, with a projected high economic growth rate for the next financial year. Further discussions will occur following the Washington-based lender’s annual spring meetings.
“Selling yuan-denominated debt will enable Pakistan to diversify its funding sources and access investors in a new market,” Aurangzeb stated in an interview with Bloomberg in Islamabad.
Panda bonds, denominated in yuan, are sold in China by offshore issuers, including governments, multilateral agencies, and companies. The market’s appeal lies in its lower borrowing costs, attracting issuers such as Egypt and Hungary. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, Panda bond issuance could potentially double in 2024, surpassing 103.35 billion yuan ($14.3 billion) from the previous year. WITH ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM APP

1,PRGMEA urges TDAP to return TEXPO 2024 to Lahore,Highlights importance of provincial capital for global trade showcase,"The Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) has voiced its concerns about the procedural violation by Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) in conducting TEXPO 2024, as the authority has relocated this year’s event to Karachi, as per a press statement. According to the schedule, this year’s event was supposed to take place in Lahore, following the previous TEXPO 2023 held in Karachi.
PRGMEA Chairman (North Zone) Ahmad Hanif has urged the authority to bring this major event back to the provincial capital of Punjab, which serves as a significant garment industrial hub. He highlighted that the previous TEXPO exhibition in 2023, held in Karachi, witnessed successful participation from Punjab, enabling esteemed members to engage with potential buyers and showcase their products to a global audience.
In a letter addressed simultaneously to TDAP Chief Executive Zubair Motiwala and Commerce Secretary Capt (r) Khurram Agha, the PRGMEA North Zone chairman requested the government to organise TEXPO 2024 in Lahore due to its importance in attracting international buyers.
Hanif noted that TEXPO Pakistan serves as a vital platform for the value-added textile sector, attracting genuine buyers and delegations from key markets such as the US, Europe, and China. He stressed the valuable opportunity for members to connect with global buyers through both B2B and B2C interactions.
However, considering the importance of regional inclusivity and fair representation, he kindly urged TDAP to adhere to the rotation schedule and organise TEXPO 2024 in Lahore.

2,Stocks succumb to selling pressure,"KSE-100 index loses 265.57 points, settles at 65,151.83","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday experienced yet another bearish session where the KSE-100 index extended losses by more than 250 points.
In the morning, trading began in a positive mood as the index reached its intra-day high of 65,534.02 points. However, the market came under selling pressure in the second half, though Pakistan had clinched a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund under its $3 billion standby arrangement and was going to hold talks for a larger loan programme.
Investors weighed reports saying that the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) had reiterated to continue with its tough economic measures as well as news of a potential increase in gas and petroleum prices.
“Stocks closed lower on investor concerns over the SIFC apex body’s decision on tough economic measures for structural reforms and the impact of the IMF’s condition of an 18% sales tax on petroleum sales,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
“US concerns over poll irregularities, likely surge in industrial power tariffs and increase in government’s treasury bond yields played the role of catalysts in bearish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 265.57 points, or 0.41%, and settled at 65,151.83.
Topline Securities, in its report, said that a range-bound session was observed as the index traded between the intra-day high of 167 points and intra-day low of 361 points. It finally closed at 65,152, down 0.41%.
Traded volumes and value for the day stood at 208 million shares and Rs7.1 billion respectively, it added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, wrote that with 0.5% week-on-week gains, the KSE-100 index traded above 66k during the week, but it was pulled down from that level.
On Friday, 33 stocks rose while 59 declined on the index with National Bank of Pakistan (+7.5%), Pakistan Services (+3.24%) and Meezan Bank (+0.41%) being the biggest contributors to the gains, it said.
Secure Logistics Group sought to raise a total
of Rs1.19 billion including Rs600 million through book building and Rs585 million from investors in pre-initial public offering (IPO).
AHL was the manager
to the offer with floor price of Rs12 per share. Pre-IPO investors included Saudi Bugshan and Karandaaz Pakistan.
“For the coming week, downside pressure can remain in force within the 64-66k range, however, we continue to anticipate an eventual upside breach through all-time highs,” the AHL report added.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala observed that profit-taking dominated the market, leading the KSE-100 index to shed 266 points and close at 65,152.
“We anticipate range-bound activity to continue and recommend investors to view any downside as an opportunity to invest in banking and fertiliser sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 208.4 million shares against Thursday’s tally of 389.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs7.1 billion.
Shares of 332 companies were traded. Of these, 120 stocks closed higher, 185 dropped and 27 remained unchanged.
Pakistan Reinsurance Company was the volume leader with trading in 24.2 million shares, gaining Rs1 to close at Rs13.08. It was followed by Pakistan International Airlines with 16.5 million shares, losing Rs2.07 to close at Rs25.54. It was followed by Pakistan Telecommunication Company with 10.9 million shares, losing Rs1.19 to close at Rs14.65.

3,Inflation slows to 22-week low,Significant decrease in vegetable prices pulls down SPI reading,"The inflation reading, measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI), decelerated to a 22-week low at 1.31% in the week ended March 21, 2024 following a notable drop in prices of tomato and onion.
The easing of inflation compared to the previous week ended a four-week rising streak, which came in the wake of suspension of onion exports during Ramazan and ahead of the arrival of a new crop next month.
According to data gathered by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the inflation level came down from the nine-week high of 1.35% recorded in the prior week.
When compared with the corresponding week of last year, the pace of inflation slowed down to a 27-week low at 29.06%, but it still remained elevated and has been in double digits for a very long time.
According to the PBS, tomato prices decreased by 36.73% to Rs105.40 per kg in the week under review compared to Rs166.58 per kg in the previous week. It was followed by onion prices that dropped 19.58% to Rs202.31 per kg compared to Rs251.58 per kg in the prior week.
Read Inflation limits philanthropic zeal in Ramazan
Potatoes cost 4.02% less as their price dipped to Rs67.30/kg compared to Rs70.12/kg earlier. Garlic became cheaper by 2.87% to Rs599.40/kg compared to Rs617.15/kg in the previous week. Prices of other essential commodities which included mash pulse, wheat flour, sugar, masoor pulse and diesel decreased up to 1.25%.
A leading onion exporter recently told The Express Tribune that the government had banned the commodity’s export for one month until April 15 to arrest its skyrocketing prices and stabilise local markets.
Besides, he said, the new crop of onion would arrive in April, which would play a major role in bringing down its prices. Tomato prices have also come down significantly after an increase in its supply compared to the prevailing demand.
However, prices of some other essential commodities listed in the SPI basket rose during the week ended March 21, 2024, led by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which became expensive apparently in the face of establishment of a black market.

4,Rupee surges to new five-month high at Rs278.14/$,"Currency’s momentum sustained by growing forex reserves, potential Panda bond issuance","The Pakistani currency reached a new five-month high at Rs278.14 against the US dollar in the interbank market, continuing its winning streak for the seventh consecutive working day, driven by persistent improvements in the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
Market discussions suggest that the rupee received further support against the greenback following Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s announcement of issuing Panda bonds worth $250-300 million in the Chinese market soon.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency rose by 0.05% or Rs0.14 on a day-to-day basis, closing at Rs278.14 against the greenback.
As a result, the currency has gained a cumulative 10.40% or Rs28.93 in the past six-and-a-half months compared to the all-time low closing at Rs307.10/$ recorded in the first week of September 2023.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the local currency increased by 0.04% or Rs0.13 during the day, closing at Rs280.73/$ in the open market.
Read Rupee rises to new five-month peak
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves (held by SBP) continued to improve for the second consecutive week, increasing by $105 million in a single week, reaching a five-week high at $8.02 billion on March 15, 2024.
The improvement in reserves suggests that foreign currency inflows have remained stronger than demand in the system, as exporters are selling a higher quantity of dollars on forward counters. Additionally, overseas Pakistanis are sending more funds to their family members in the homeland to meet Ramazan and Eid expenditures.
Market discussions suggest that the rupee has the potential to test Rs277/$ on the upside in the ongoing cycle of appreciation.
Gold price declines
The gold price decreased by Rs4,200 per tola (11.66 grams), dropping
to Rs228,200 in Pakistan on Friday from a six-and-a-half-month high reached at Rs232,400 tola
on Thursday.
The decline in bullion prices aligns with the global trend, as it fell by $40 to $2,185 per ounce (31.10 grams) in world markets, according to the All Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association.
The upward trend in the rupee partly supported the downward correction in the precious metal in Pakistan, as the country meets its demand through imports.

5,CCP finishes Telenor merger review,Report to be finalised next week; merger unlikely to cause market distortion,"The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has almost completed the first phase review of a merger under which Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) is taking over operations of Telenor Pakistan. It is likely to finalise a report by next week.
Sources said that different teams of the CCP had obtained almost all the required documents from relevant stakeholders and their analysis was likely to be completed by March 30.
Under the Competition Act, 2010, the phase-I review of a merger is completed in 30 days after the acceptance of an application and the basic criterion for the phase-I review is to determine whether the merger is strengthening a dominant position.
PTCL holds 100% stake in Ufone and the merger of PTCL/ Ufone and Telenor Pakistan is less likely to cause market distortion in the cellular landscape of Pakistan.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Telenor Pakistan is the third largest mobile telecom company with 44.78 million subscribers while Ufone is at the fourth spot having 25.28 million subscribers.
While their collective subscriber base will widen to 70.06 million, the largest player in Pakistan is Jazz with 70.95 million subscribers, or 37.31% of the total market share.

On the other hand, the collective share of Ufone and Telenor will be 36.84% of the total subscribers.
The second position in the current scenario is held by Zong Pakistan with 47.40 million subscribers but after the completion of merger formalities, it will drop to the last place among three cellular mobile operators in Pakistan.
The government of Pakistan has the largest shareholding of 62% in PTCL while 26% shares along with management rights are held by ‘e&’ of the UAE telecom operator Etisalat.
After lengthy and secretive talks, which were mostly held outside Pakistan, the management of e& entered into a deal in December 2023 with the management of Telenor for taking over all interests of Telenor in the country.
The CCP conducted the phase-II review from February 12, 2016 to March 9, 2016, when Jazz acquired Warid Telecom, putting itself in a dominant position.
Meanwhile, a senior official of Ufone emphasised that the CCP could initiate the phase-II review based on certain conditions like any complaint from the remaining two telecom operators and to ensure transparency in the process.
The phase-II review is a 90-day process and is conducted if a merger significantly reduces competition by creating or strengthening a dominant position.
The CCP’s phase-II review of the formal merger between PTCL/ Ufone and Telenor Pakistan will be held after the start of next fiscal year in July.
At the same time, the Ufone-Telenor merger will meet other thresholds for the phase-II review, which include combined assets of more than Rs1 billion for the merging parties and their combined revenue surpassing Rs1 billion.

6,Retailer tax registration launched,"SIFC to monitor progress on compulsory scheme, incentives for advance payment","The government unveiled the compulsory tax registration scheme for retailers and wholesalers doing business in six cities of Pakistan on Friday. This move also marks the first test case of the ruling party’s political will to expand the narrow tax base.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) issued the statutory regulatory order to implement the new scheme from April 1, 2024. With the issuance of this notification, Pakistan has fulfilled a condition set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ahead of the board meeting to approve the $1.1 billion final loan tranche.
Stakeholders have been given seven days to provide suggestions and raise objections to the draft of the scheme, named “Special Procedures for Small Traders and Shopkeepers.” However, the scheme’s scope has been expanded to include dealers, retailers, manufacturer-cum-retailers, importer-cum-retailers, or any person involved in the supply chain of goods.
This scheme is announced for Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Quetta, and Peshawar, which are major trade hubs in Pakistan.
Previous attempts to bring traders into the tax net have been unsuccessful, including compulsory door-to-door registration during General Pervez Musharraf’s martial law period. Even the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) too holds a soft corner for traders and has backed off from similar attempts, including one in 2015.
During the first eight months of this fiscal year, retailers paid a mere Rs11.2 billion in income tax compared to the Rs217 billion paid by the salaried class.

This time, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) will monitor the progress of the compulsory registration scheme for retailers.
Details show that the salaried class remained the fourth-largest income tax contributor during the first eight months of the current fiscal year. The additional tax paid by the salaried class slightly exceeded the total tax of Rs61.3 billion paid by wealthy exporters.
According to the FBR notification, the scheme will apply to traders and shopkeepers operating through a fixed place of business, including stores, shops, warehouses, offices, or similar physical locations within the territorial civil limits, including cantonments, in the six cities.
The scheme is launched for registration and payment of minimum advance income tax, effective from April 1st. However, traders will make their first tax payments on July 15th, according to the notification.
Traders and wholesalers have been given one month by the FBR, expiring on April 30th, to register. Failure to register will result in forced registration by the FBR in its National Business Registry.
A central repository database of traders and shopkeepers will be accessible through a Tajir Dost module tax application or the FBR’s portal for registration and advance income tax payment.
Every trader is liable to pay monthly advance tax on the 15th of each month. Even if a trader’s income is below the income tax threshold, they must pay a minimum of Rs1,200 per annum income tax.
The FBR also announced a 25% tax incentive for traders who pay their full tax in advance before the due date or file income tax returns for the tax year 2023.
Tax returns for the tax year 2023 remained low at 4.2 million, compared to 5.9 million in the preceding year.
Traders will pay tax through a separate computerised payment receipt against the payment slip ID. The tax will be calculated based on the trader’s annual rental value, which is 10% of the fair market value of the business premises. This includes all business places, stores, warehouses, and any other offices.
According to FBR statistics, over 80% of bank accounts are not visible to FBR authorities, many of which are operated by these traders.
The fair market value will be calculated based on the valuation of immovable properties notified by the FBR. In cases where such valuations are unavailable, the district officer’s valuation will serve as the benchmark.

7,Experts warn against internet shutdowns,"Suspension of services results in financial losses, disruptions, lament industry leaders","According to Information Technology (IT) experts, the government should explore viable alternatives rather than resorting to suspending mobile phone broadband and data services. They argue that such suspensions not only disrupt entire IT services but also inflict major financial losses on IT businesses, impacting both public and private organisations, as well as the general public in the country.
IT-related businesses encompass numerous services, including those provided by the IT sector, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), commercial banks, and their respective apps, e-stores, and more. People heavily rely on mobile phone or digital apps for payments and various e-services, such as InDrive, Yango, Bykea, FoodPanda, Daraz, aimed at saving time.
“We need to enhance IT exports, and human resources are crucial for this endeavor. The human resource works in the country for providing services to foreign clients. Internet disruption impacts IT services, and foreign clients hire services from neighbouring countries because of disruptions of Net services here,” lamented Saquib Ahmad, SAP Managing Director in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
Ahmad further highlighted the prevalence of apps like JazzCash and Easypaisa in rural areas, stressing their significance for financial transactions. He also pointed out the challenges faced in maintaining personal and social connections, particularly with family members abroad, when services like WhatsApp are affected.
The increasing reliance on cloud solutions significantly impacts supply chains and end-consumer businesses. When mobile phone broadband services are suspended, users shift to ISP’s internet services, overwhelming and slowing them down.

“We need alternative solutions to internet suspensions. National security is paramount, but we must embrace modern technology solutions while prioritising lawful interception methods,” he urged.
Founder and CEO of Icreativez Technologies, and leading SEO expert in the country, Mehboob Shar reiterated the importance of uninterrupted internet services for businesses, especially in fields like digital marketing. He unscored that internet disruptions lead to nearly 100% losses in digital marketing, as various tools like SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), social media, content, email, and PPC (pay per click/ Google ads) depend entirely on internet connectivity. Businesses reliant on these tools come to a complete standstill when internet connectivity is disrupted.
“Because of poor or dysfunctional internet services, foreign clients who hire our services lose trust in us. We also face a 20-30% loss in terms of poor reputation in front of foreign clients. There is no other solution except for fast and uninterrupted Net services as SEO and digital marketing fields call for 100% and 24/7 active internet connectivity,” he concluded.
Last week, Amnesty International, along with a coalition of human rights activists and civil society organisations, called for the immediate restoration of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), blocked in the country since February 17.
X has been inaccessible since former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha resigned over what he said was alleged “election rigging” in the Rawalpindi division.
The platform ban came after the blockage of mobile phone services on election day – February 8.
“The arbitrary blocking of platforms, including the prolonged and unannounced disruption of “X” (formerly known as Twitter) since 17 February 2024, is a sobering illustration of growing digital censorship in the country,” said the statement.
The human rights organisation also criticised the “complete silence of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA)” and termed it extremely alarming as the authority failed to furnish any reasons for the ban and “exceeded its mandate to block an entire internet platform”.

8,‘Aggressive’ funding for nuclear energy needed,Dar calls for support from global financial institutions in developing initiative,"Minister for Foreign Affairs Ishaq Dar, on Friday, called for “aggressive” financing by International Financial Institutions and multilateral development organisations for developing countries to help them launch nuclear energy projects. Speaking in a video message after attending the First Nuclear Energy Summit hosted by the Belgian government and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the foreign minister highlighted the challenges faced by developing countries in benefiting from nuclear energy due to its costliness.
Dar stressed that, after hydropower, nuclear energy stands out as the safest and most cost-effective energy source, particularly for developing nations. He noted that many leaders at the summit shared this perspective, underscoring the crucial role of international financial institutions (IFIs) and multilateral development institutions in financing such projects.

Praising the Belgian government and the IAEA for organising the summit, Dar described it as a positive step forward, especially in light of Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change, as evidenced by the devastating losses incurred during the 2022 floods.
The foreign minister highlighted Pakistan’s existing nuclear energy projects, with a capacity of around 3,000MW, and announced plans by the incumbent government to commence work on Chashma Nuclear Plant-V, following its approval by the previous government. Dar also mentioned his side-line discussions with counterparts from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Belgium, as well as meetings with the Chinese vice premier and the director general of the IAEA. He specifically commended Pakistan’s Ambassador in Brussels, Amna Baloch, and Aftab Khokhar in Vienna, along with their respective teams, for their active involvement during the brief visit.

9,Phase 2 of CPEC accelerated with new economic corridors,"Collaborative efforts aim to fast-track development initiatives, enhance regional connectivity","Pakistan and China intensified efforts on Friday to establish a Working Group on five new economic corridors under the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), aligning with the 5Es framework prepared by the Planning Ministry.
During a meeting between the Federal Minister of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives, Ahsan Iqbal, and the Chinese envoy, Jiang Zaidong, both sides agreed to expedite the second phase of CPEC and establish a working group on five new economic corridors, including the Corridor of Job Creation, Corridor of Innovation, Corridor of Green Energy, and Inclusive Regional Development.
Both the Planning Ministry and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China will prepare separate concept papers on the new economic corridors, providing a clear roadmap for each sector in the future. These concept papers will be consolidated for presentation at the upcoming Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) meeting expected in 2024, stated the Planning Ministry.
The Planning Ministry has already initiated the implementation of the 5Es framework, which includes Export, Energy, Equity, E-Pakistan, and Environment. This framework will align with the five new economic corridors to advance Pakistan’s prosperity in each sector under the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, emphasised the minister, highlighting the importance of accelerating Pakistan’s export capabilities through enterprise development and job creation.

During the meeting, the planning minister outlined a strategic approach to maximise the success of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) within Pakistan. He proposed a “one plus four” model, wherein each SEZ in Pakistan would be partnered with one province from China, one industry group to develop specialised clusters within the SEZs, one SEZ from China to provide technical expertise, and a state-owned enterprise to spearhead SEZ development. Iqbal highlighted that this collaborative framework would expedite the establishment and growth of SEZs in Pakistan, enhancing their competitiveness and attractiveness to investors.
The Chinese envoy appreciated Pakistan’s efforts to implement the CPEC, particularly the initiation of phase 2. Addressing Pakistan’s need to boost the efficiency of SEZs to increase foreign exchange, the Chinese envoy suggested that officers in charge of SEZs must visit Chinese industrial parks to observe firsthand the efficiency measures practiced by Chinese authorities. The ambassador further highlighted Pakistan’s commendable transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy.
Iqbal stressed that the success of SEZs depends on their ability to become clusters of specific industries, fostering economies of scale, and creating a vibrant ecosystem conducive to innovation and growth.
The discussions also focused on enhancing regional connectivity, with a special emphasis on critical infrastructure projects like the Gwadar Port and the M-8 motorway, which will strengthen trade links and facilitate regional integration.
