In its April 2024 ‘Asian Development Outlook’, the Manila-based lending agency said on Thursday that potential supply chain disruptions from the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East would weigh on the economy, reported Dawn.com.
With Pakistan’s large external financing requirements and weak external buffers, disbursement from multilateral and bilateral partners remains crucial, it said, adding that these inflows could be hampered by lapses in policy implementation.
The ADB highlighted that support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a medium-term reform agenda would considerably improve market sentiment and catalyse affordable external financing from other sources.
The report projected that economic growth in Pakistan for the FY25 would reach 2.8 per cent, driven by higher confidence, reduced macro-economic imbalances, adequate progress on structural reforms, greater political stability, and improved external conditions.
Growth was estimated to remain subdued during FY24 and pick up next year, provided economic reforms take effect, it said.
Meanwhile, real gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow by 1.9pc in 2024, driven by a rebound in private sector investment linked to progress on reform measures and transition to a new and more stable government.
The report further forecast that inflation will remain at about 25pc this year, driven by higher energy prices, but was expected to ease in 2025.
While improvement in food supplies and moderation of inflation expectations would likely ease inflationary pressures, further increases in energy prices envisaged under the IMF Stand-By Agreement were projected to keep inflation high, it observed.
Although improved supplies tempered food inflation, it remained high, driven largely by rising prices for energy and inputs to agriculture. Core inflation also remains elevated, reflecting domestic recovery and the pass-through of upward adjustments in energy prices, the ADB said.
On the supply side, it noted that post-flood recovery in agriculture would lead to growth. The report said output would rise from a low base on improved weather conditions and a government package of subsidised credit and farm inputs supporting expanded area under cultivation and improved yields.
Higher farm output would help expand manufacturing, which would also benefit from the increased availability of critical imported inputs. Large-scale manufacturing expanded in three of the first six months of 2024, the report highlighted.
According to the report, the relaxation of import restrictions and economic recovery were expected to widen the current account deficit.
However, imports were expected to expand during the year as domestic demand strengthened, and the stabilisation of the currency market made it easier for firms to import inputs. Thus, the current account deficit was projected to widen to 1.5pc of GDP in 2024.
The report pointed out that Pakistan would continue to face challenges from substantial new external financing requirements and the rollover of old debt, exacerbated by tight global financial conditions.
The ADB said tax collection increased by 29.5pc, as reforms in the personal income tax, higher taxes on property transfers, and the reintroduction of taxes on cash withdrawals from banks and the issuance of bonus shares raised direct tax collections.
Revenue mobilisation was expected to strengthen in the medium term, reflecting planned reforms to broaden the tax base, it added.

1,Chinese exports fall more than feared in March,US topples China as Taiwan’s largest export market.,"BEIJING: Chinese exports plunged more than expected last month, official figures showed on Friday, as the world’s second-largest economy struggles to sustain its post-pandemic recovery.
Shipments sank 7.5 per cent on-year, while imports shrank 1.9pc, the General Administration of Customs said.
A Bloomberg survey of economists had forecast exports to fall just 1.9pc and imports to rise 1pc.
The slump was  “to a large extent… due to the fact that March this year has two working days less than March last year”, said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
“The working day effect distorts the picture, as it often does in the first quarter due to Chinese holidays.” He added that comparing Chinese trade over the first quarter of the year instead of a monthly basis  “shows a reasonable story about external demand”.

US topples China as Taiwan’s largest export market

The government is trying to firm up slowing growth as global demand continues to show signs of weakness.
They are also battling deep-seated domestic issues ranging from a debt-battered property sector to high youth unemployment and low consumption.
Consumer prices narrowly averted falling into deflation territory last month in a rare bright spot for policymakers.
Beijing has set an annual GDP growth target of around five percent for this year, and quarterly growth figures are expected in the coming days.
US topples China
Meanwhile, the United States has topped long-time leader China as Taiwan’s main export market for four consecutive months due to a surge in demand for microchip products and AI technology, Taipei’s Finance Ministry said on Friday.
Self-ruled Taiwan is a microchip-manufacturing powerhouse, churning out the world’s most advanced silicon wafers necessary to power everything from e-vehicles and satellites to fighter jets and increasingly to power AI technology.
 
 

For two decades, its top export market has been China — which claims Taiwan as part of its territory — but December data from the Finance Ministry shows the United States topping the list for the first time since August 2003.
In December, Taiwan exported $8.49bn in products to the US, compared with $8.28bn to mainland China.
The trend continued through March, when US exports increased by 65pc to $9.11bn, a 6pc jump, while mainland China received $7.99bn.
Those figures exclude Hong Kong, which holds its own status as a customs territory. When combined with mainland tallies, China remains the top destination for Taiwanese goods.
A Finance Ministry official in the trade division attributed the recent US tilt to the global “reorganisation of electronics and ICT (information and communication technology) supply chains, and the popularity of the AI industry”.
Since Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen came to power in 2016, she has been working to strengthen economic ties with the United States, seeing Washington as a crucial partner as neighbouring China grows increasingly aggressive.

2,PEL wins legal battle against Canadian firm,"The tribunal has declared by a majority that it does not have jurisdiction over the dispute, and FHL will bear the arbitration costs, which are fixed at $250,000.","ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani oil firm has won a legal battle against a Bermuda-based company at the International Court of Arbitration, which ruled that Pakistani laws govern the Petroleum Concession Agreements (PCAs) signed in the country.
The Bermuda-based company Frontier Holdings Ltd (FHL) faced defeat in a prolonged legal dispute at the International Court of Arbitration against Petroleum Exploration (Pvt) Ltd (PEL).
The over 80-page arbitration court ruling also marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s legal landscape, affirming the country’s legal sovereignty over arbitration agreements related to Petroleum Concession Agreements (PCAs) and Joint Operating Agree­ments (JOAs).
The tribunal declared by a majority that it does not have jurisdiction over this dispute, and FHL will bear the arbitration costs, which were fixed at $250,000.
The legal battle was initiated by FHL, a subsidiary of Canadian company JuraEnergy Corporation, after their dispute with a local partner, PEL, in the Badin North and Badin South blocks, in which FHL holds a 27.5pc share. 
The blocks were awarded in 2006 by the Ministry of Petroleum.
The tribunal’s ruling highlights that parties entering into agreements related to PCAs and JOAs in Pakistan must abide by Pakistani laws regarding the legal framework governing their transactions.
Meanwhile, a senior PEL official said the international arbitration was intended to obstruct oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) activities in Pakistan.
The official added that such companies function as non-operators in the E&P sector and have defaulted on their financial obligations towards the government of Paki­stan and key industry players, including OGDCL and Mari Petroleum.
On the other hand, FHL’s chief executive officer has yet to respond despite repeated requests by Dawn to present his point of view on the matter.

3,A blessed Ramazan  for PSX,"KSE 100 index is at an all-time high and has experienced a sharp recovery with a remarkable 75pc increase in US dollar terms over the past nine months, says Topline Securities Ltd.","KARACHI: The bulls tightened their grip in the outgoing short week as they staged a surprise rally on the eve of Eidul Fitr, tossing the benchmark KSE 100 index to a new peak.
It was the fourth record-breaking session at the end of Ramazan, a new trend for the PSX, which usually sees low volume and lacklustre activities in the holy month.
 
 

According to Topline Securities Ltd, the KSE 100 index is at an all-time high and has experienced a sharp recovery with a remarkable 75 per cent increase in US dollar terms over the past nine months.
However, the picture differs for passive long-term investors. Since its peak in 2017, the brokerage noted that the index, when measured in US dollars, remains down by 50pc.
“This discrepancy underscores the impact of political and economic uncertainties on investment values. Hence, stock market investors in Pakistan must continually adjust their portfolios to seize opportune moments amidst fluctuating market conditions,” it added.
Arif Habib Ltd (AHL) said the market maintained its upward trajectory in the two-session week before the start of the Eid holidays, settling at an all-time high level above 70,000 points.
The positive sentiment stemmed from the agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia during the prime minister’s visit to the kingdom to expedite the planned Saudi investment package worth $5bn.
Last year, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $25bn within the next five years under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), seeking investments from Arab countries in the energy, IT, minerals, defence, and agriculture sectors.
The $5bn investment is expected in the minerals sector, especially Reko Diq gold and copper mines. Saudi Arabia has already been studying the prospects of tapping into this sector, though the kingdom is also interested in petroleum, agriculture, and IT.
Moreover, Pakistan’s government international bond of $1bn is set to mature on April 15. Furthermore, remittances increased by 16pc year-on-year to $2.95bn in March, the highest after April 2022. Additionally, the rupee remained unchanged at Rs277.94 against the US dollar.
As a result, the market closed at 70,315 points after adding 1,898 points or 2.77pc week-on-week.
Sector-wise positive contributions came from commercial banks (563 points), fertiliser (344 points), E&P (250 points), power (179 points) and OMCs (106 points).
Meanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed negatively were automobile parts (4 points) and insurance (3 points).
Scrip-wise positive contributors were Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd (352 points), Hub Power Company Ltd (176 points), Meezan Bank Ltd (172 points), United Bank Ltd (113 points) and MCB Bank (89 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Engro Corporation (51 points), Dawood Hercules Corporation Ltd (45 points), Bank Alfalah Ltd (14 points), Interloop Ltd (5 points) and K-Electric Ltd (5 points).
Foreign buying continued, clocking in at $4.2m compared to a net $3.9m last week. Major buying was witnessed in the all-other sector ($3.2m) and commercial banks ($0.8m). On the local front, banks/DFIs reported selling ($4.9m), followed by individuals ($3.2m). The average volume jumped 18pc to 363m shares, and the average value traded rose to $59m.
AHL expects the market to remain positive in the coming week. Developments on the privatisation and new IMF programme fronts would further improve market sentiment.
Furthermore, the result season is expected to commence in the upcoming week, where certain scrips are anticipated to be in the limelight amid the expectation of robust results.

4,Musk to meet Modi as India woos EV investment,"“Looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India,” says Musk on X.","NEW DELHI: Tech billionaire Elon Musk said on Wednesday he planned to meet Indian Prime Minis­ter Narendra Modi, following suggestions the Tesla boss will soon announce major investment plans in the country.
He made the announcement on his social media platform X, without giving a date for his visit.
“Looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India,” he wrote. Indian media reported the visit could be in the week of April 22, but there was no official confirmation.
Last month, India cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global auto­makers committed to investing $500 million and starting local production within three years.
 
 

The reduced 15 per cent tax would apply for five years to any imported electric car priced at $35,000 and above, India’s commerce ministry said in a statement at the time.
The move was widely seen as a win for Musk’s Tesla. In 2021 the billionaire, responding to a user on X, said that India’s high import duties had prevented Tesla from launching its cars in the country.

5,UK growth uptick fuels hopes of recession exit,British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says figures “are further evidence that the economy has turned a corner”.,"LONDON: Britain’s economy grew for the second straight month in February, official data showed on Friday, boosting recovery hopes after it fell into recession in the second half of 2023.
Gross domestic product ticked 0.1 per cent higher in February following an upwardly revised 0.3pc expansion in January, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement.
Growth for the first quarter as a whole would signal the end of the UK’s recession, and many economists say another contraction now appears unlikely.
“The economy grew slightly in February with widespread growth across manufacturing, particularly in the car sector,” said ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown.
“Services also grew a little with public transport and haulage, and telecommunications having strong months,” she added.
“Partially offsetting this there were notable falls across construction as the wet weather hampered many building projects.” The UK economy shrank in both the third and fourth quarters of 2023, meeting the technical definition of a recession, as high interest rates and a cost-of-living crisis weighed on activity.
Outlook ‘foggy’ 
“The sun is finally out but the UK economy outlook remains foggy,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.
“Despite weaker momentum in February, the economy’s ongoing recovery is the latest piece of evidence that the shallow technical recession is already behind us.” 
She also cautioned that there were  “limits to the UK’s growth potential”, noting  “fragile” consumer spending, a weak housing market and uncertainties surrounding this year’s upcoming general election.
Capital Economics economist Paul Dales said GDP would need to slump by an  “unlikely” 1pc in March in order to spark a first-quarter contraction that would prolong the recession.
“As a result, we can safely say that, after lasting just two quarters and involving a total fall in GDP of just 0.4pc or so, the recession ended in the fourth quarter,” Dales said.
In reaction to Friday’s news, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared that the figures  “are further evidence that the economy has turned a corner”.
Emergence from recession would hand a major boost to Sunak ahead of a general election this year.
His governing Conservatives are trailing far behind Keir Starmer’s main opposition Labour Party in opinion polls.

6,"Oil, gold surge on Middle East tensions",LONDON: Wall Street stocks slid on Friday despite banks beating expectations at the start of earnings season as oil...,"LONDON: Wall Street stocks slid on Friday despite banks beating expectations at the start of earnings season as oil and gold prices shot up amid worries about the conflict in the Middle East widening.
“Geopolitical worries have triggered some risk aversion, but worries about a growth slowdown have presumably triggered some residual angst about corporate earnings not living up to expectations,” said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare.
Oil prices were up more than two per cent as regional tensions soared after Iran threatened reprisals over a strike in Syria this month that killed two Iranian generals.
Brent crude futures were up 94 cents, or 1.1pc, at $90.68 a barrel by 1:40pm EDT (1740 GMT), while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 96 cents, or 1.1pc, to $85.98.
For the week, Brent was set to fall around 0.5pc, while WTI was on track to close 1pc lower.
Gold prices rose above $2,400 per ounce to an all-time high on Friday, heading for their fourth week of gains, as growing tensions in the Middle East prompted investors to seek refuge in the safe-haven assets.
Spot gold eased 0.8pc to $2,353.35 per ounce as of 1:40 p.m. ET (1740 GMT), taking a breather after hitting a record high of $2,419.79. Prices were up around 1pc for the week.
US gold futures settled 0.1pc higher at $2,374.1.
Investor attention was set to focus on the start Friday of the corporate earnings season after economic data released earlier this week largely killed off the possibility that the US Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates in June.
Equity markets took the recalibration of expectations of interest rate cuts in their stride as the data showing the US economy in strong health raised hopes that companies will report strong earnings.
At the start of the year markets had priced in six interest cuts by the Fed in 2024, but now expect only two.
JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all reported better-than-expected earnings results for the first quarter. But shares in JPMorgan Chase, which have risen strongly this year, fell by more than four percent after trading got under way in New York.
Shares in Wells Fargo and Citigroup rose modestly.
Wall Street’s main indices fell at the opening bell.
Eurozone stock markets mostly rose after the European Central Bank signalled Thursday a likely June interest rate cut.
“Despite a few volatility spikes, EU stock investors reacted positively to ECB President Christine Lagarde’s speech. The central banker reassured everyone, saying the ECB would stick to its rate-cut plan regardless of the recent hot inflation report in the US,” said ActivTrades analyst Pierre Veyret.
London stocks fizzed higher on data showing the UK economy grew for a second straight month in February, further fuelling recovery hopes after sliding into a shallow recession in the second half of last year.
Dimming hopes for US rate cuts continued to support the dollar, which surged to another 34-year high above 153 yen, putting Japanese officials in the spotlight after they said they were ready to intervene in markets to support their currency.
