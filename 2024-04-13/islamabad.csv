0,Another change in Islamabad’s master plan on the cards,Summary sent to govt to carve out residential plots in H-16 sub-sectors,"ISLAMABAD: City managers are making efforts to make another change to Islamabad’s master plan as the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has moved a summary to the federal government, seeking a change in the use of land in two sub-sectors of H-16.
Sources said the CDA’s planning wing had recently moved a summary to the interior ministry for onward submission to the federal cabinet for making amendment to the master plan and changing land use of two sub-sectors - H-16/1 and H-16/4 - from institution-specific to residential sub-sectors.
The sources said the CDA wanted to create residential plots in the two sub-sectors for the land affected persons of Chantra village whose land had been acquired and were entitled to receive alternative plots.
“Yes, we have moved a summary to the interior ministry. Hopefully the ministry will move it to the Cabinet Division after Eid holidays,” a senior CDA officer said.

Summary sent to govt to carve out residential plots in H-16 sub-sectors

He said a meeting on the subject was likely to be held at the interior ministry next week.
Instead of proper revision of the master plan, the successive governments and CDA managements had been making selected changes to the master plan of Islamabad. Until now, 45 changes had been made.
On the other hand, Doxiadis Associate, which had prepared the city’s master plan, had recommended that the plan should be revised after every 20 years as per requirement. But, instead of proper revision, focus was paid on selective changes. No proper revision has been made, which has resulted in poor planning and mushroom growth of unauthorised construction.
Like previous governments, the issue of revision of the master plan was also taken up by the former caretaker prime minister, Anwaarul Haq Kakar, during a cabinet meeting. He had directed the CDA to propose new names for the commission.
The Kakar-led caretaker cabinet had directed for inclusion of urban planners and other professionals in the commission having national and international expertise. Accordingly, sources said the CDA officials proposed names of professional experts for the master plan commission to do the much-needed revision.
In the summary, which was moved in February this year, the CDA proposed seven names of urban planners out of whom the cabinet would finalise five.
The experts include Dr Shabihul Hassan Zaidi, Dr Imran Mohammad, Dr Abdul Waheed, Umar Farooq, Mohammad Abdullah and Khurram Farid Bargat.
The CDA also proposed a panel of three experts for one post of transportation planning specialist. They names are Khushal Khan, Mian Wamiq Anwar and Azam Khan Lodhi.
Two names of architects - Prof Dr Noman Ahmad and Ejaz Ahmed Qadri - were suggested against one post while the names of former member engineering and planning CDA Hafiz Ehsanul Haq, Dr Pervez Ahsan Khan and Prof Dr Obaidullah Nadeem were proposed against the posts of civil engineer, water resource and management expert and academicians, respectively.
Similarly, for one post of environmentalist, the names of Viqar Zikria and Dr Ghulam Raza Bhatti had been proposed along with urban economist Dr Naveed Iftikhar and senor lawyer Hafiz Arfaat Ahmad.
The ex-officio members included the CDA chairman, who will act as the convener of the commission, and the member planning, chief physical planning and housing, Planning Commission of Pakistan, directors general of Rawalpindi Development Authority and Pakistan Environment Protection Agency, director general planning CDA and any other co-opted member to be nominated by the civic agency’s member planning. But, the caretaker cabinet did not take up the said summary.
When the PTI government came to power in 2018, it announced that the master plan would be revised and the then prime minister, Imran Khan, also formed a commission. However, the commission, after a delay, prepared an interim report in 2020 which was mostly related to building by-laws and regularisation of certain areas, including Banigala.
But the commission left proper revision of the master plan to a professional firm which due to various reasons could not be hired till Mr Khan’s government was ousted. The CDA officials are now pinning hopes on the elected government for approval of the summary related to the formation of the commission.
A senior official said the summary related to H-16 focused on only two sub-sectors and whenever it would be approved, the CDA’s planning wing would create residential plots in these sub-sectors.
He said the second summary was related to formation of a commission and whenever the cabinet gave its approval, it would start working. He further said it could take two years to properly revise the master plan of the federal capital as it was a gigantic task.

9,CDA asked to refer cinema plot transfer case to FIA,Inquiry committee finds cinema plot in G-7 transferred illegally,"ISLAMABAD: After establishing that the cinema plot’s transfer was illegal, the inquiry committee has recommended to the CDA management to refer the matter to Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The three-member inquiry committee headed by director works of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) Habibullah Sheikh said in its findings that the cinema plot in Sitara Market in G7 was being used for commercial purposes instead of cinema.
The committee pointed out that despite this violation, the plot was transferred to new buyer(s) on the basis of a fake No-Objection Certificate (NOC). Therefore, committee recommended that this matter should be referred to the FIA.
Sources in the CDA said that recently, when the matter reached the court, it had also ordered that action should be taken against the officials concernedof CDA for violating the rules in this regard.

Inquiry committee finds cinema plot in G-7 transferred illegally

The CDA had allotted a subsidised plot (number 6) for the cinema decades ago in Sitara Market, G-7 Markaz.
The allottee of the plot ran the Kohsar Cinema there till early 2000. 
Later, he gradually started using the property for commercial purposes and constructed dozens of shops on it in violation of the terms and conditions of the allotment letter.
The sources said that last year officials from the CDA Building Control Directorate and Estate Wing transferred the nonconforming property to another party in violation of rules.
The sources said when the matter came into the notice of CDA Chairman Anwarul Haq, he ordered an inquiry, which established wrongdoing in transfer of the plot.
The sources said without an NOC from the Building Control Section (BSC) and a No Demand Certificate (NDC) issued by Estate Management, a commercial property cannot be transferred. 
However, in this case, before transferring the property the Building Control Section did not intimate the violation to Estate Wing and transferred the plot on the basis of fake NOC.
The sources said for the transfer of the cinema plot, the owner was supposed to remove the non-confirming use first. 
When property was transferred there was around three dozen commercial shops, but despite this the plot was transferred.
The sources said that this case could be the tip of the iceberg and there is a need to check other NOCs and NDCs issued by the building control and BSC related to commercial buildings during last five years.
In the cinema plot case and commercial shops, CDA ignored massive violations while on the other hand; the officials concernedwhile transferring a small five marla plot, become very strict in following rules.
“Now, in the inquiry report it has been transpired that property was transferred in violations of rules. Therefore, strict action should be taken against those responsible for the violation,” said an official.
He said that this was a well-known case of nonconforming use as owner of property had been making efforts for long to get the property transferred, but last year, it was transferred on the basis of fake NOC.
When contacted, an officer of CDA confirmed to Dawn that inquiry committee had established that property was transferred on the basis of fake NOC. 
He said that action would be taken in the light of the inquiry report.

10,Senate carries out self-assessment to improve its efficacy,"NA says it identified 14 opportunities to strengthen the institution, of which at least five related directly to gender equality.","ISLAMABAD: In an effort to bolster its democratic infrastructure, the Senate recently undertook a significant self-assessment initiative in collaboration with the Inter-Parliamentary Union and other partners.
The initiative, based on the Indicators for Democratic Parliaments, aimed to evaluate and improve the Senate’s effectiveness in upholding democratic principles.
According to a study shared by the Senate on Friday, since independence in 1947, the country had grappled with the challenge of establishing and maintaining robust democratic norms. Despite various endeavours, the journey towards democratic consolidation had been marked by hurdles.
Recognising the need for introspection, the Senate embarked on a rigorous assessment of its strengths and weaknesses, ultimately yielding 14 recommendations for enhancing its efficacy, the study said.
The genesis of this self-assessment dated back to 2019, when the IPU, in collaboration with parliamentary organisations and stakeholders, initiated the development of the toolkit. A pivotal moment arose during a focus group discussion, where a member of the parliament recognised the potential of such an assessment for their country. Subsequently, the idea gained traction within the Senate, garnering widespread political support.
The self-assessment framework comprised 25 indicators, each delineating several criteria, aligned with targets 16.6 and 16.7 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. To spearhead this endeavour, a steering committee comprising three senators was formed, working in tandem with the Senate’s secretary general and leveraging support from the parliamentary digital development unit (PDU).
The Senate said undoubtedly, the process was not devoid of challenges. Limited time and competing priorities posed hurdles. However, three months post-commencement, the Senate successfully concluded the assessment process, consolidating feedback into a comprehensive document encompassing evidence, grades, and recommendations for reform.
Throughout the assessment journey, senators gained insights into the administrative capacities, accessibility standards, and operational transparency of the Parliament. Importantly, the exercise underscored the Senate’s ability to harness internal resources and take ownership of the evaluation process, transforming it into a strategic document tailored to address institutional needs.
The completion of this self-assessment marked a pivotal step in Pakistan’s democratic evolution, reaffirming the Senate’s commitment to transparency, inclusivity and efficiency in parliamentary operations. As the Senate moved forward, the recommendations gleaned from this introspective exercise were poised to guide policy reforms and foster a more robust democratic framework.
The lower house said importantly, it identified the 14 opportunities to strengthen the institution, of which at least five related directly to gender equality. These included establishing a Parliamentary Budget Office, establishing a bureau as the collective governing body of parliament, with representation from both houses, strengthening the role of parliament in the appointment of ministers and cabinet members, strengthening of the role of the Senate with respect to the Money Bill, with special reference to the role of senators in proposing amendments to the Money Bill and approving the budget.
Ensuring that Pakistan’s national legal framework was consistent with international human rights obligations, introducing a constitutional or legal provision related to conflicts of interest, which would require lawmakers to declare sponsored travel and accommodation, regulating the practice of lobbying by individuals or groups, each with varying and specific interests, which attempted to influence decisions taken at the legislative level and establishing legal provisions relating to equal physical and online access to the parliamentary building, its processes and proceedings, for all citizens, regardless of disability or other special needs were some other recommendations.
The Senate also identified developing an impact assessment manual, guide or similar document that established procedures and criteria for assessing the impacts that a proposal for a law, a programme or a policy might have on different groups, and potentially entrusting such assessments to a dedicated body, as an opportunity.
Among other opportunities were devising policies and/or plans on gender mainstreaming and considering the gender lens when formulating parliamentary policies, holding workshops or dialogue sessions for senators and secretariat staff on bringing gender-responsive budgeting into the mainstream, periodically assessing gender balance in the Secretariat to ensure the effectiveness of related policies, particularly at senior levels.
Amending the Senate’s rules of procedure to enable senators and secretariat staff to care for young children during the conduct of legislative business, and introducing online voting and video-conferencing facilities to help senators and staff with caring responsibilities to exercise their duties and introducing childcare facilities for senators and secretariat staff were also among the proposals.
The IPU, in matters of democracy and parliamentary strengthening, did not dictate but rather facilitated so that parliaments drove the process, fostering a sense of ownership and legitimacy. Pakistan is a case in point, the study added.

The statement claimed that the suspect was wanted in connection with a number of cases while the FIR said his criminal activities were not reported to police, Dawn has learnt.
Besides, an e-tag was not given to the FIR which was registered after more than 14 hours of the incident. As per the FIR, the police cordoned off the hideout of the suspect but his accomplices managed to escape.
Over the encounter that took place at Pindori Syedan, the FIR was registered at the Kirpa police station under section 302, 324, 353, 186, 427, 148 and 148 along with a section of the Arms Ordinance.

Talking to Dawn, senior police officers said an e-tag allotted to a complaint lodged with the police was also mentioned in the FIR. This e-tag is generated by the computer along with the name of the police station concerned and the date along with a serial number, they added.
Besides, the e-tag also has details about the complaint and the date and time on which it was lodged with the police. According to the FIR, the encounter occurred at around 4:30am on April 9 and over the incident a report was registered in the daily diary (Roznamcha) at around 8:15am.
The police delayed the registration of the FIR for over 12 hours and at around 6pm on April 9 its PRO confirmed to Dawn that the case was yet to be registered.
According to the FIR, the police raided the hideout of the suspects at Pindori Syedan in response to information about the presence of a proclaimed offender, Bahadur Ali, and his accomplices wanted to police in connection with a murder and attempted murder case registered on September 8, 2023, at the Kirpa police station. The suspects had formed a gang and they were carrying out robberies almost every day. Besides, the wealth and honour of the citizens were not safe from them, it added.
Moreover, people were so terrorised by the gang that they did not report their activities to the police, the FIR said. In response to the information, a 12-member police team along with an armed personnel carrier (APC) reached the hideout and cordoned it off.
The police knocked at the door of the Dera and in response Ahmed Shah, armed with a Kalashnikov, opened it, the FIR said. Seeing the police, he started shouting and soon his four to five accomplices opened fire from inside.
“Ahmed Shah sustained bullet injuries from the firing of his accomplices and fell on the ground and died,” it claimed. However, the two policemen at the door remained unhurt as they were in protective gear. Later, the other suspects escaped from the rear even though the police chased them.
On the other hand, a police statement posted on X on April 9, 2024 at 2:53pm claimed that Ahmed Shah was wanted in connection with over 12 cases of murder, dacoity and robbery registered at Loi Bher and Sihala police stations. This was despite the fact that the FIR had stated that people did not report their criminal activities to the police. The statement claimed that Ahmed Shah was a proclaimed offender, but in FIR Bahadur Ali was described as the proclaimed offender.
On April 9, the police PRO through a message had invited media persons to an ‘important’ press conference by DIG Operations Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari at 3:45pm at Police Lines Headquarters. But it was canceled at the eleventh hour due to unknown reasons, the officers said, adding the police were to announce at the press conference the arrest of a criminal wanted in connection with a number of cases.
When contacted, the police PRO said an e-tag was allocated only to a complaint lodged for registration of a case. In the instant case, the FIR was registered in response to an “istaghasa” prepared by police and hence an e-tag was not issued.
He said a complaint and istaghasa were different as the latter was a police proceeding. 
However, a lawyer and senior police officers, when contacted, explained to Dawn that the word istaghasa meant a complainant and without a complaint no FIR can be registered. As per section 154 of CrPC, a case (FIR) is registered only in response to a complaint either written or verbal, they added.
In a verbal complaint, the SHO concerned is bound to write the complaint and get the signature of the complainant on it after reading it out to him before registering the FIR. In any case, a complaint is mandatory for the registration of an FIR, either from the victim or the police on behalf of the state, they added.
The PRO also said the police had information about Bahadur Ali but during the raid at the hideout they found another proclaimed offender. 
When asked how he was wanted by the police and declared a proclaimed offender when people were afraid of registering complaints about his criminal activities, the PRO said people avoided registering cases against him in recent months but the suspect was wanted to police in connection with FIRs registered long ago.
