0,"Lightning strikes claim 25 lives in Punjab, Balochistan","17 individuals died in Punjab while eight perished in Balochistan, according to officials","Fatal lightning bolts on Saturday claimed at least 25 lives in different areas of Punjab and Balochistan, with spring showers also lashing various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), flooding their low-lying areas.
According to Punjab's Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), lightning incidents mostly occurred in Multan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, and Bahawalnagar districts.
Four individuals lost their lives in lightning strikes, with two fatalities reported in both Chaman and Sorab areas of Balochistan. Additionally, one person was killed in each of the following districts: Qila Abdullah, Muslim Bagh, Pishin, and Dera Bugti.
An official statement revealed that Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Ali had called deputy commissioners of various districts and directed them to ensure the provision of medical treatment to people affected by rain-related incidents.
He urged immediate drainage of water from low-lying areas and utilizing all available resources and machinery for water drainage. The PDMA advised people to stay in safe places and avoid unnecessary travel during rain.
Most cities in Punjab, including its provincial capital Lahore, experienced light rain and drizzling, leading to pleasant weather and a decrease in the intensity of heat.
Meanwhile, flash floods unleashed by heavy rainfall in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan wreaked havoc across the province on Saturday.
Floods washed away the remains of a damaged bridge in the Chashma Achozai area of Quetta, causing the suspension of traffic. A vehicle carrying four people was also swept away, but all four individuals were later rescued by local residents.
Video images shared on social media showed long queues of vehicles standing after the partial collapse of the bridge. ""We have been waiting since morning to cross to the other side,"" lamented Syed Fateh Shah Arif, a resident of the area. He highlighted that women and children were the worst sufferers of the traffic suspension since they had to cover long distances to reach their homes.
Torrential rains also damaged dozens of houses in Kalat, Mastung, Gwadar, Pishin, and Qila Abdullah districts of the province. Flash floods caused the suspension of traffic in the Bolan Kachhi area of Balochistan and in the Mekran belt of the province.
The PDMA has declared an emergency across the province to tackle the situation. Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti also directed the PDMA and other concerned departments to step up efforts to ensure timely rescue and relief operations in the province.
Lightning has already claimed four lives in Pishin, Sorab, and Qila Saifullah districts.
Heavy rains also lashed different parts of K-P, including its capital Peshawar, where rainwater accumulated in low-lying areas. Rains, accompanied by thunder and lightning, started in Peshawar on Friday night and continued on Saturday.
According to the meteorological department, Peshawar has recorded 9 millimeters of rainfall so far. The rain caused water from streams and drains to overflow onto roads and streets, resulting in increased difficulties for people and affecting traffic.
Water also entered homes in low-lying areas of Peshawar, turning streets and roads into pools of water, presenting challenges for residents.
In Chitral district of K-P, heavy rains swept away a key road, leading to the suspension of all traffic between Chitral and Peshawar. Rains also damaged a house, causing injuries to a child.
Chitral Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Imran informed the media that heavy machinery was at work to reopen roads. He stated that a high alert had been issued to those living close to nullahs and streams.
“Officials of the district administration as well as officials of the National Highway Authority (NHA) and the PDMA have been put on high alert,” he said.

He mentioned reports of tourists' vehicles being affected by floods in Chamarkhan Nala, but assured that the route has been restored now.
“Due to rain, the Chitral to Peshawar road is closed for all types of traffic due to flooding in rivers and tourists and local people have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel.”
According to the Meteorological Department, 18mm of rain was recorded in Kalam, 17mm in Malam Jabba, 15mm in Parachinar, 17mm in Chitral, 10mm in Darosh, and 9mm in Mirkhani.
In upper K-P and Kashmir, rains were accompanied by strong winds and thunder. Rains and snowfall are likely to continue intermittently till April 15, the official said.
Meanwhile, electricity supply was affected in most areas of K-P due to rain and as many as 140 PESCO feeders were tripped, according to a PESCO spokesperson.
He revealed that 56 feeders tripped in Peshawar Circle, 44 in Khyber, 20 in Swat, and 22 in Bannu Circle. ""PESCO field staff are working to restore power. Repair work on several feeders has been completed, and electricity will be restored soon,” he said.

1,Opposition launches protest with massive rallies,Warns govt against using coercive tactics to suppress dissent,"Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of the newly formed alliance of opposition parties Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Aain (TTA), has urged the government not to use coercive tactics against any political party, including the PTI, warning that otherwise, the opposition will launch a massive movement.
“Police are dishonoring our youth, women, and elders in Sindh, Punjab, K-P, and Balochistan. I want to remind them that they are the police of this country. I urge them to stop this behavior,” Achakzai said while addressing a massive public rally in Pishin district of Balochistan.
Achakzai, of PkMAP, was chosen a day earlier to lead the six-party alliance also including the PTI, the SIC, the BNP-M, the JI, and the MWM.
This alliance kicked off its protest movement against alleged rigging in the February 8 general elections from Balochistan by staging two separate public gatherings in Pishin and Chaman on Saturday.
Achakzai said that only a foreign occupation force humiliates the people of an occupied territory, adding that “it is justified for people facing oppression to rise against an oppressor”.
He said police may arrest our children, women, and elders but they do not have the right to disgrace them. “People must be treated with dignity no matter what,” he added.
He said all over the world the state inculcates the spirit of freedom in its youth, but in Pakistan, an attempt is being made to stifle it.
He asked the government servants to mend their ways, warning that if they continued to oppress the people, it might one day become impossible for them to come out in public in their official uniforms.
Criticizing the political system, Achakzai said in this country turncoats were reaching the National Assembly and the Senate through fake elections. He also opposed the idea of giving extensions to civil and military officials after their retirement, describing it as one of the evils plaguing the country.
He said he and all other opposition parties respect the army and are ready to salute armed forces as long as they abide by their oath and do not interfere in politics.
The PkMAP chief warned that foreign powers wanted to destabilize the entire region from Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to India. He urged the need to establish peace and harmony among the neighboring countries based on the principle of “live and let live”.
PTI’s Omar Ayub emphasized the need for transparency and accountability, particularly in light of the recent incidents involving “violence” against PTI activists. He called for solidarity among opposition parties and announced plans for nationwide rallies to mobilize support for their cause.
Sher Afzal Marwat of the PTI reiterated his party's commitment to raising awareness among the people about the authorities “injustices” against his fellows, stressing the need for judicial reform and protection of civil liberties.

Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the chief of the BNP-M, criticized the alleged rigging of the elections and called for an end to “meddling” in affairs of democratic institutions. He said the people of Balochistan had always stood by the Constitution and the rule of law in the country.
""Our struggle for the supremacy of the Constitution will continue,” Mengal announced.
The leaders addressing the rally also voiced their concerns and demands through a series of resolutions—addressing pressing issues confronting the country including the nation's governance, judiciary, media freedom, and human rights.
They fervently condemned the erosion of judicial independence and the intimidation of judges. They emphasized the need for a robust and impartial judiciary to uphold the rule of law.
Furthermore, they also demanded the preservation of freedom of the press, stressing the importance of maintaining a vibrant and independent media landscape essential for a functioning democracy.
Addressing human rights issues, they called for the release of political activists, including those affiliated with the PTI, and the termination of cases against them. Additionally, they condemned the enforced disappearances of political figures and demanded their immediate release.
Meanwhile, the opposition leaders urged for comprehensive reforms in foreign and economic policies, an end to corruption, as well as focusing on national development. Following the presentation of the resolutions, prominent political figures took to the stage to address the gathering.
They also expressed solidarity with the demands of those staging the Chaman sit-in, highlighting the need for the government to address the grievances of the protesters. The alliance also organized a public gathering at the site of the Chaman sit-in to mount pressure on the government to accept the protesters’ demands.

2,Karakoram Highway blocked in Kohistan,"Protesters lament 'neglect', reject suspension of police officers and demand compensation for Pakistani driver","Tensions flared as residents of Upper and Lower Kohistan districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took to the streets, blocking the Karakoram Highway on the third day of Eidul Fitr to voice their discontent over the suspension of senior police officers following the Bisham suicide attack.
Angered by the actions taken against local authorities and the perceived neglect of Muhammad Riaz's family, who lost his life in the Lower Kohistan explosion, citizens from both districts staged a protest blocking the Karakoram Highway for several hours in Lower Kohistan and Upper Kohistan.
Protesters gathered at mosques across Lower Kohistan, converging at RMB Chowk and subsequently blocking the Karakoram Highway. Meanwhile, residents of Upper and Lower Kohistan also vented their frustration in the main bazaars of both districts.
Voicing their grievances, demonstrators argued that the suspended officials were not accountable for the attack, which took place in Shangla district's Bisham area, not in Kohistan.
They criticised the suspension of officials from Kohistan and Hazara division while demanding justice and compensation for the Pakistani driver who lost his life in the attack.
They condemned the federal government for suspending the administrative officers of both districts of Kohistan, Lower Kohistan and Upper Kohistan.
People protested against the recent Bisham suicide incident and against the “conspiracy to defame Kohistan” in which scholars, dignitaries, youths and others participated in large numbers.
The protesters chanted slogans against Information Minister Attaullah Tarar while blocking the Karakoram Highway for two hours.
One of the protesters, Maulana Abdul Aziz Haqqani, said that Kohistan had remained peaceful during a surge in militancy in Malakand and other areas. He further highlighted that after the 2021 attack in Upper Kohistan, China had received a large amount as compensation but authorities did not do the same for the Pakistani driver who was killed.
He said that he would not rest until the federal government provided compensation to the heirs of the Pakistani driver killed in the Bisham attack. He also alleged that authorities had not even visited the family of the deceased driver.
“We will not let the government continue [with] this behaviour [of] suspending the Kohistan, Hazara division police officers in a case pertaining to Shangla and Malakand division,” Maulana Israr, another protester, said.
He said that the protesters wanted a transparent inquiry into the blast, adding that action should be taken against those who were responsible for the crime.
Maulana Waliullah Tawhedi said that doling out punishments to officers from Kohistan in a case pertaining to Shangla was not justified. He also demanded compensation for the Pakistani driver killed in the attack, saying that it should be equal to the amount given to the Chinese.
On March 26, a suicide bombing in K-P's Bisham claimed the lives of five Chinese engineers, alongside their Pakistani driver, while en route from Islamabad to a hydroelectric dam construction site in Dasu. The bus fell victim to the attack in the city of Bisham, located within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Shangla district.
In the aftermath of the devastating incident, China swiftly demanded a thorough investigation into the blast and heightened security measures for its citizens.
Responding to this urgent call, Islamabad promptly announced its commitment to conduct a comprehensive probe to bring the ""perpetrators and accomplices"" to justice. Chinese investigators also arrived to collaborate in the investigation.
In line with the Chinese government's insistence on a swift and thorough investigation, the authorities in Islamabad resolved to establish a joint investigation team to delve into the attack.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took decisive action, ordering the dismissal of five senior police officers due to their alleged negligence and security oversights that contributed to the Bisham attack.
Speaking at a press briefing, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar disclosed that the sanctioned action targeted the police chiefs of Hazara division, Upper Kohistan, and Lower Kohistan districts, as well as the security director of the Dasu Hydropower Project and the commandant of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Special Security Unit.
""The inquiry report identified these security officials' negligence in their duties, emphasising their failure to maintain vigilance on the day of the tragic incident,"" Tarar remarked, further stating, ""Disciplinary measures will be implemented within the next 15 days.""

3,Nation outraged after 9 killed execution-style in Noshki,"President, PM reiterate resolve to wipe out terror","The sickening massacre of nine innocent would-be economic migrants from Punjab in the Noshki district of Balochistan has triggered nationwide outrage with top government officials, including the president and the prime minister, pledging to bring the perpetrators to justice and “root out the spectre of terrorism” once and for all.
At least nine passengers were plucked from a bus, abducted, and killed execution-style in the horrific attack that appears to be motivated by ethnic hatred, police and administration officials said on Saturday.
While no group immediately claimed responsibility for the sickening executions, Baloch separatist groups have carried out such targeted assaults, particularly against people from Punjab – the province they blame for the alleged exploitation of Balochistan’s natural resources.
Noshki’s Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Musakhail confirmed to The Express Tribune that 10 to 12 attackers opened fire on a bus en route to Taftan border after the driver did not stop at a roadblock on the Quetta-Taftan National Highway N-40.
The gunmen then boarded the bus at a place called Sultan Charhai, and seized nine passengers after checking their national identity cards to make sure they were from Punjab, added Abdullah Mengal, an official of Noshki police station. “All of them were travelling to Taftan en route to Iran,” he said, adding that the victims were shot at close range.
The bullet-riddled bodies of the abducted passengers were later discovered by law enforcers from beneath a bridge after one and a half hours, added Musakhail. The victims, all of them men, hailed from Wazirabad, Mandi Bahauddin, and Gujranwala district of Punjab.
Levies and the Frontier Corps launched a coordinated operation to comb the area for attackers. Economic migrants from Punjab often use lesser-known routes to sneak into Iran for their onward illegal journey to Europe. Few are lucky to get there, while most are either caught in Iran or Turkey.
Following the grisly discovery, the victims’ bodies were shifted to the Civil Hospital in Quetta from where they were driven to the Police Line for funeral prayers. The chief minister, Mir Sarfraz Bugti, directed that the bodies be driven to the hometowns of the victims via ambulances.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the brutal killings by terrorists and said that the entire nation rejects the nefarious designs of terrorists.

“Security forces are determined to eradicate terrorists with the help of the entire nation,” he said in a statement issued from the Presidency. The president offered condolences to the bereaved families.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also denounced the grisly executions and sought a report from the provincial administration. He offered his condolences saying: “We stand with the bereaved families in this hour of grief.”
The prime minister stated that the perpetrators of this heinous act of terrorism and their facilitators would be punished. “The spectre of terrorism would be rooted out, he reiterated,” he said in a statement issued by his office.
Chief Minister Bugti also expressed grief and sorrow over the gruesome tragedy. “Terrorists would be dealt with iron hands,” he said and vowed that the nefarious designs of terrorists would be thwarted.
Balochistan has been in the throes of a deadly Baloch separatist insurgency since 2004 and the fluid security situation has been further exasperated by ethnic, extremist, and sectarian terrorism in the dirt-poor but resource-rich province. Hostile agencies, especially India’s RAW, have also been actively involved in stoking unrest in the province for strategic objectives.
Baloch separatists and religious extremists have repeatedly carried out such executions in the past. In October last year, gunmen shot dead six Punjabi labourers in Turbat. They were hired for a construction project in the area and lived in a house provided by their contractor.
At least 20 construction workers were shot dead and three others injured in a similar attack on a labourers’ camp in Turbat in 2015. The victims, all hailing from Punjab and Sindh, were asleep when gunmen stormed their camp and carried out the sickening massacre.

4,UN contact group on Afghanistan stalled,"Central to proposal was appointment of UN special envoy for Afghanistan, a move rejected by Taliban authorities","The proposal to establish a regional contact group on Afghanistan has hit a roadblock due to differences among participating nations regarding the inclusion of certain countries.
The initiative for forming a regional contact group stemmed from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's proposal in February, following a two-day conference in Doha aimed at charting a roadmap for Afghanistan's future.
The United Nations-hosted conference brought together special representatives from 25 countries and Afghan civil society activists to discuss strategies for engaging with the Taliban-led government in Kabul while ensuring its compliance with international commitments.
Central to the proposal was the appointment of a UN special envoy for Afghanistan, a move rejected by the Taliban authorities. Concurrently, the UN secretary-general proposed the formation of a contact group specifically focused on Afghanistan.
This group was envisioned to include Afghanistan's immediate neighbors and other relevant stakeholders. However, Pakistan's objection to India's participation in the proposed regional group has led to a deadlock, according to diplomatic sources.
The sources indicated that progress on the proposal has stalled due to the lack of consensus on which countries should be part of the regional group. ""The proposal appears to be a non-starter,"" remarked another source.
Historically, Pakistan and India have viewed each other's roles in Afghanistan with suspicion. Islamabad's resistance to New Delhi's inclusion in the regional contact group stems from its longstanding concerns that India undermines stability in Afghanistan.
Interestingly, while Pakistan's relations with the Taliban government remain strained, India has intensified its engagement with Kabul in recent months.
The proposal to establish a regional group was part of broader UN efforts to enhance coordination in dealing with the Taliban-led government. A UN delegation is scheduled to visit Kabul soon as a follow-up to the Doha conference, aiming to urge the Taliban government to fulfill its international commitments.
Despite initial expectations, the interim Taliban government has adopted hardline policies, challenging perceptions of moderation. ""Many anticipated that Taliban 2.0 would be more moderate, but it's becoming increasingly evident that these expectations were misplaced,"" commented a Western diplomat.
This poses a dilemma for the international community, as sidelining the Taliban government would only exacerbate the humanitarian and economic crises in Afghanistan.
The upcoming UN delegation's visit seeks to convey to the Taliban government the adverse consequences of its hardline stance. Sources warn that the lack of international recognition for the Taliban administration would diminish humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, further exacerbating the plight of ordinary Afghans.

5,Pakistan has highest living cost in Asia: ADB,Report projects 15% inflation rate for next FY,"Pakistan has the highest living cost in whole of Asia with 25% inflation rate and its economy may grow at the fourth lowest pace of 1.9% in the region, read a new Asian Development Bank (ADB) report.
Released on Thursday, the Asian Development Outlook also painted a gloomy picture for the next fiscal year as well.
Published from Manila, the report has projected 15% inflation rate for the next fiscal year -- again the highest among 46 countries and a 2.8% growth rate -- the fifth lowest for FY2024-25.
The ADB stated that the inflation rate in Pakistan is expected to be 25% in the current fiscal year -- the highest in whole of Asia. This makes Pakistan the most expensive nation in Asia. Earlier, the cost of living in Pakistan used to be the highest in South Asia.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and federal government had set the inflation target at 21% for this fiscal year but they are going to miss it despite inflicting huge losses in the shape of a 22% interest rate.
The ADB said during the current fiscal year, the country’s economic growth rate might remain at 1.9% -- the fourth lowest after Myanmar, Azerbaijan and Nauru.
Pakistan is in a stagflation phase for a prolonged period and the World Bank too said last week that another 10 million more people might fall into the poverty trap because of any adverse shocks. About 98 million people are already living a poor life in Pakistan.
Despite these gravest conditions, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb have the audacity to approve four salaries in reward for the already highly paid officers of the PM Office.
The total impact of the decision for the officers category will be over Rs50 million -- a sum that is enough to buy 34,247 kilogrammes of wheat at market prices. There is also a glaring similarity in the ADB and World Bank reports this time.
In the past, the ADB gave a rather optimistic economic scenario close to Pakistan’s official forecasts.
However, the latest ADB report stated that Pakistan would continue to face challenges from substantial new external financing requirements and the rollover of old debt, exacerbated by tight global monetary conditions.
The Manila-based lender said political uncertainty that affected the macroeconomic policy making would remain a key risk to the sustainability of stabilisation and reform efforts.
On the external front, the potential supply chain disruptions from escalation of the conflict in the Middle East negatively affect the country’s economy, it added.
The ADB said with Pakistan's large external financing requirements and weak external buffers, disbursement from multilateral and bilateral partners remained crucial.
The Manila-based lender cautioned that these inflows could be hampered by lapses in the policy implementation.
“Further IMF support for a medium-term reform agenda would considerably improve market sentiment and catalyse affordable external financing from other sources,” the report added.
Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is set to meet the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva next week in Washington to request a new bailout package.
The IMF MD said this week that Pakistan was in discussions for a potential follow up programme.
However, she said that there are “very important issues” to be solved in Pakistan: the tax base, how the richer part of the society contributed to the economy, the way public spending is being directed, and creating a more transparent environment.
The IMF has in the past raised questions over the lack of transparency in the affairs of the Sovereign Wealth Fund and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).
In Pakistan, rising administered energy prices will keep inflation high at 25% in this fiscal year and 15% in FY2025, the ADB said.
The Manila-based lender said challenges remained in sustaining reforms given the substantial debt servicing costs in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
In Pakistan, fiscal revenues remain weak with rising interest payments expected to consume 63% of budget revenues against 39.5% in 2022.
The ADB noted that adhering to the economic adjustment programme was critical to restoring macroeconomic stability and the gradual recovery of growth.
“Pakistan’s economy is showing signs of a gradual recovery supported by higher crop output and improvement in manufacturing,” said ADB Country Director for Pakistan Yong Ye.
He added that growth was forecast to resume in 2024 and strengthen in 2025.
However, he observed that the continued implementation of policy reforms was crucial to buttressing this momentum as well as fortifying the country’s fiscal and external buffers.
In the last fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy contracted due to lingering impacts of 2022’s devastating floods; uncertainty; policy slippage; as well as weakened production, consumption, and investment, the ADB pointed out.
The report further read that Afghanistan’s currency had become stronger against the Pakistani rupee.
“The Afghani appreciated against the Pakistan rupee and the Iranian riyal, the currencies of the country's main import suppliers,” it continued.
The appreciation of the two neighbouring countries’ currencies against the Pakistan rupee has likely maintained deflation for the entire fiscal year 2024 in Afghanistan given the high pass through of exchange rate changes into inflation.
The ADB said low confidence, a surge in living costs, and the implementation of tighter macroeconomic policies under the IMF programme would restrain domestic demand in Pakistan.
It said the government’s goal was to achieve a primary surplus of 0.4% and an overall deficit of 7.5% of GDP in FY2024, with both declining gradually in subsequent years.
However, the World Bank said last week that Pakistan would miss both these budget targets.
The ADB said the revenue mobilisation was expected to strengthen in the medium term, reflecting planned reforms to broaden the tax base.
A rise in interest payments equal to 1% of GDP from higher rates boosted expenditure to 8.8% of GDP in the first half of FY2024 from 7.6% a year earlier.
“Fiscal consolidation will also benefit from plans to rationalise current expenditure,” the ADB report predicted.
The relaxation of import restrictions, coupled with economic recovery, is expected to widen the current account deficit, the ADB observed.
“Thus, the current account deficit is projected to widen to 1.5% of GDP in FY2024.”
A transition toward a market-determined exchange rate is expected to encourage remittance inflows through official channels, thus enhancing the economy's resilience under future external shocks, the report added.
