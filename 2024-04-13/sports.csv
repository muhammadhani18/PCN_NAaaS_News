0,Eid joy amid inflation woes,"Both shoppers, traders appear upset about the effects of inflation","As the holy month of Ramadan comes to an end, preparations for Eid-ul-Fitr peak across the country with markets swarmed by crowds of busy shoppers.
While the festival of Eid is equally important for children, adults, and the elderly, women seem very enthusiastic about the preparations for Eid-ul-Fitr. Their preparations start a long time before Eid.
The shopping for clothes and visits to tailors start from the first ten days of Ramadan, while the purchase of shoes and jewelry is usually done in the last 10 days. Similarly, the purchase of henna and bangles is done on Chand Raat (night before Eid) when markets are most crowded.
Speaking to Express Tribune, women at Lahore's Liberty Bazaar express that prices of clothes, shoes, bangles, and jewelry have increased a lot. “Everything is getting expensive in the market. Nothing is economical.” Exclaimed a shopper. She said that last year she used to buy suits for Rs 2000, which are now priced at Rs 4000. A set of simple bangles was Rs 200 last year while this year its price is Rs 350. Similarly, children's shoes are at least Rs 2000. The women shoppers lamented that due to the price hike they are not able to figure out which thing to buy and which to let go. Another shopper explained “We are trying to complete the children's shopping first because after all Eid is for children. If the children are happy, we will be happy too.”
Meanwhile, local shopkeepers claim that there is a lot of rush in the markets, but sales are low due to inflation. Even though shoppers leave their homes while fasting in the heat with the intention to
buy something, most of the buyers are disappointed and return empty- handed due to high prices.
Talking to The Express Tribune a shopkeeper, in Liberty Market Lahore, said “Petrol and the dollar have become expensive. Because of this, the prices of goods have increased, which is not our fault. We want the customer to buy something at a good price but electricity has become very expensive, and the same is the situation with the rent of the shops. If our expenses increase, where can we meet them? We obviously pass our burden on to the customer.
He further stated “Just as Eid is for you, it a special occasion for us also. We are forced to increase prices as we live in times of inflation. We simply cannot buy things at high costs and sell them at low prices.“
While a celebratory spirit has taken over the city, both shoppers and traders appear upset about the effects of inflation on Eid Shopping.

1,Three-day remand extended in minor’s sexual abuse case,Extension comes after the police requested additional time to conduct further tests on the accused,"A magisterial court has extended the physical remand of an accused, implicated in a sodomy case involving a minor, by three days.
The extension comes after the police requested additional time to conduct further tests on the accused.
Accused Qari Abubakar was once again brought before the Shahdara police, seeking an extension of his remand to facilitate additional testing.
The defense counsel argued against the extension, alleging that the police had unlawfully obtained evidence by serving intoxicants to the accused during his initial custody.
He claimed that the accusations were fabricated and that his client was wrongfully implicated in the case.
The defense further contended that the accused was taken into custody from Nankana and that the police filed the FIR after detaining him for only one day. Despite these arguments, the judge granted the police's request and extended the accused's physical remand for three days, instructing the authorities to expedite their investigation.
According to the FIR filed by the victim's father, on April 7, he sent his 10-year-old son to the market to buy food items for Sehri (pre-dawn meal). When the boy did not return home, his father began searching for him. He eventually found a crowd gathered at a nearby graveyard, where his son was found crying and the accused had been apprehended. Upon questioning, the boy revealed that he had been sexually assaulted by the accused in the graveyard.

2,"Taxation officer, sons accused of double murder",Police claim Makhdoom group allegedly orchestrated attack,"Two men were killed during an exchange of gunfire on Eidul Fitr in broad daylight.
A case has been filed against taxation officer Makhdoom Ghulam Qasim, his two sons, and an associate in response to a complaint lodged by Rizwan Khan Gadi at the Police Station City Kot Addu.
According to the FIR, Gadi recounted that while he was celebrating Eid at his in-laws' house, Ali Hamza Garmani and Ashfaq Hussain requested a ride to a location near City Marriage Hall.
As they passed Girls' College on their bikes, a white vehicle suddenly blocked their path, and individuals identified as Shahbaz Qasim alias Maga Makhdoom, Bilal Qasim alias Puma Makhdoom, and Saqib alias Jam Saqi emerged, opening fire on them. Asad Bilal, also known as Balu Briar and Ali Hamza lost their lives on the spot.
Prior to this incident, during a previous altercation, a member of the Makhdoom group, Kashif Maliha, had been injured by gunfire. Seeking revenge, the Makhdoom group allegedly orchestrated the attack.
Despite attempts at reconciliation between the two parties, it is alleged that Excise and Taxation Officer Makhdoom Ghulam Qasim provided his sons and an accomplice with a Kalashnikov, instructing them to locate and kill Asad Bilal alias Bilal Balo.
The double murder on Eidul Fitr has instilled fear and unease among the citizens of Kot Addu, highlighting concerns over the deteriorating law and order situation in the city.
Amir of Jamaat-e-Islami Kot Addu and Provincial Assembly candidate, Furqan Asif Buzdar, has released an audio message condemning the incident, calling for swift justice and improved security measures.

3,Two killed in exchange of fire over land dispute,Four others sustained serious injuries during exchange of fire in Risaldar,"Two men were killed when a dispute over six kanals of land escalated into a fatal exchange of gunfire in Risaldar within the jurisdiction of Hujra Shah Moqim police station.
Four others sustained serious injuries during exchange of fire. Police apprehended three suspects allegedly involved in the altercation.
The conflict reportedly stemmed from a dispute over land between two groups in the area. On the day of Eid, Muhammad Ismail, a student at Okara University, was visited by friends at his residence. However, the gathering turned violent when Yusuf, Mohammad Abbas, and their associates launched an attack armed with firearms, axes, and clubs.
As the situation escalated, gunfire ensued, resulting in the death of Asad Ali at the scene.
Among the injured was a pregnant woman, Amna Bibi, who, along with three others, was rushed to the hospital for medical treatment. Sadly, one of the injured individuals succumbed to their injuries, while the remaining victims remain in critical condition.
Muhammad Ismail filed a formal complaint with the police, leading to the registration of a case against the accused. In a twist, the accused also filed a case against Ghulam Yasin, alleging that the deceased, Asad, had an illicit relationship with their relative.
Asad purportedly opened fire in a fit of rage, resulting in the death of Ghulam Mustafa and severe injuries to two others.
Police authorities, under the direction of DPO Okara Mansoor Aman, have initiated an investigation into the incident. A dedicated police team has been formed to conduct thorough inquiries, with ongoing efforts to apprehend any additional suspects involved.
