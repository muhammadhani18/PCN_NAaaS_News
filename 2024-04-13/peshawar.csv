The girl’s elders ordered family members to kill her and the police constable during a meeting in the Baffa-Doraha area here, according to his brother and local MPA, Fazl Haq.
“The 10th grader’s family suspects that she has an affair with the policeman, and therefore, it has issued orders for their assassination under the local chor custom for bringing dishonour on it,” he told Dawn on Friday.
The lawmaker also claimed that the police sent the girl to Darul Aman (the government-run shelter home) for her protection after seizing her in the Bisham area of Shangla district, as her family was taking her to Upper Kohistan to follow the jirga’s orders.
He said that efforts were under way to “sort out the issue amicably.”
“We’re in the process of settling the matter in line with the local traditions to protect both lives. A jirga will go to the girl’s elders soon for reconciliation,” he said.
Mr Haq insisted that his and the girl’s families had been living on a street in the College Doraha area for many years and knew each other well.
He added that the girl’s mother wanted to marry the 17-year-old off to his brother, angering the family’s elders.
The lawmaker said that his brother had gone into hiding, fearing for his life, while the police had held the girl’s father and two other family members in light of her statement.
SNOW REMOVAL: Adviser to the chief minister for tourism Zahid Chanzeb on Friday said he had ordered the deputy commissioner to clear snow from the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road without delay for the resumption of tourism activities in the Kaghan Valley.
“This important [MNJ] artery should immediately be freed from snow so that tourist activities could be restored in the Kaghan Valley,” he told reporters here.
He also said the damages caused by avalanches on the Lake Road should be assessed to start the rehabilitation exercise.
Mr Chanzeb said the deputy commissioner had submitted a report about hotels and other buildings damaged or heavy snowfall and avalanches along the MNJ Road that linked Naran, the commercial hub of Kaghan Valley, with Saiful Muluk Lake.

2,Swat residents urge police to curb street crime,"SWAT: The tranquil Swat valley, once renowned for its low crime rate, is now grappling with a surge in street crimes...","SWAT: The tranquil Swat valley, once renowned for its low crime rate, is now grappling with a surge in street crimes such as mobile snatching and robberies, causing distress among the residents, who have urged the police to swiftly quell these incidents. 
On April 5, unidentified individuals on motorcycles tortured a student, Shah Nawaz in Nawkaley Chowk, and snatched his mobile phone. 
In another incident, Hameed, 17, was robbed by three unidentified individuals near Amankot Market.  
Hameed recounted that while he was on way to purchase food and other daily necessities, the perpetrators forcibly placed him into a rickshaw. “They took Rs20,000 from me and then threw me out of the moving rickshaw near Grassy Ground.” Hameed Khan reported the incident to Rahimabad police.  
In yet another occurrence, on April 6, unidentified motorcyclists intercepted a boy, Huzaifa, near the hockey stadium in Makan Bagh Mingora and snatched his mobile phone and wallet. Huzaifa filed a report with Mingora police. 
Multiple instances of mobile phone snatching were reported across Kabal, Saidu Sharif, College Colony, Wakey and several other areas throughout March and April. The residents have voiced grievances against the police, alleging their reports of robbery were not being properly registered at the relevant police stations; instead their complaints were recorded merely as lost items.  “People used to say that Swat is a paradise on earth, untouched by the street crime plaguing other cities. Now, it’s disheartening to see these incidents becoming a reality here,” said resident Imtiaz Ali, reflecting on the changing scenario in Mingora.  
Zubair Khan, another resident, echoed similar sentiments, stating, “We always felt safe in Swat, never worrying about walking down the streets. But now, with these street crimes emerging, that sense of security has been shattered.” 
Dr Jawad Iqbal, a social activist, reflecting on the social impacts of such crimes, remarked, “These street crimes disrupt the fabric of our society. They not only rob us of our belongings but also rob us of our peace of mind and sense of community trust. It’s heartbreaking to see the impact it’s having on our once tight-knit neighbourhood.” 
Social activists emphasised that Swat, being a bustling tourist destination in the country, cannot afford to ignore the alarming issue of street crimes. They cautioned that if the authorities fail to swiftly address and control this rising trend, it could have detrimental effects on the tourism sector.  
Mingora and Kabal police have reported the arrest of the suspects in question, along with the recovery of a sum of money and mobile phones from their possession.

Mr Gandapur took notice of some pictures shared on social media, and called it an attempt to ‘hurt’ sentiments of the deserving people.  
A statement issued from the chief minister’s secretariat on Friday said that the provincial government distributed Ramzam package among 0.8 million people, including legal heirs of the martyred police personnel, across the province, and the package was distributed in a transparent and dignified manner. 
It said that according to the party policy, it was clearly mentioned that pictures won’t be taken during distribution of the package, terming it the reason why Mr Gandapur did not participate in any such event. 
“Despite clear party and provincial government’s policy, some government officials and public representatives took pictures while distributing the package among the deserving people. We have sought explanation from the persons concerned,” the statement quoted Mr Gandapur as saying. 
“The provincial government believes in serving people, rather than promoting itself,” the chief minister said, adding this must be made sure such a thing didn’t happen in future. 
Meanwhile, in another statement issued from the chief minister’s secretariat, Mr Gandapur congratulated the national squad for their performance in the junior squash championship in Australia. 
Mr Gandapur said the provincial government would facilitate players for promotion of sports in the province.

4,"Despite high Covid incidence, KP yet to start sample collection, contact tracing",81 cases of virus reported in province in last 40 days,"PESHAWAR: Though 81 people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa tested positive for coronavirus in the last 40 days, the health department has yet to start sample collection from suspected Covid-19 cases for testing and tracing those who were in close contact with confirmed cases.
Officials told Dawn that the health department had repeatedly asked authorities in districts to start sending samples to the Public Health Reference Laboratory at the Khyber Medical University, Peshawar, to ascertain the exact Covid-19 prevalence so that measures for the virus’s prevention and control could be taken.
They warned that the growing coronavirus incidence could assume alarming proportions if the suspected cases weren’t tested.
The officials said the province recorded 60 Covid-19 cases in March and 21 in April, suggesting that the virus was circulating and could cause a major public health issue if district authorities continued to ignore the health department’s call for the immediate launch of a contact tracing campaign.

81 cases of virus reported in province in last 40 days

They said two months ago, the department had asked the district health officers to start testing suspected cases and send “positive” samples to the PHRL to detect new variants, but none of them had complied with the orders.
“We want to subject symptomatic cases and those with respiratory, renal, and cardiac issues to screening and ensure they take preventive steps against the virus,” an official told Dawn.
He added that most of the new cases were hit by the new coronavirus strain, JN1, and they included men and women as well as children.
“People with co-morbidities are most vulnerable to coronavirus. New variants of the virus threaten people’s health and lives,” he said.
Officials said the department’s directives to start Covid-19 screening of suspected patients weren’t followed in the districts as the government had yet to clear its dues from the years 2021 and 2022.
A doctor told Dawn that he, as a member of the rapid response team, had been performing Covid-19 duty since 2021, but the department had yet to clear his Rs800,000 dues.
He claimed that he used his vehicle and paid for petrol from his own pocket for that work.
When contacted, Dr Irshad Ali Roghani, the director (public health) at the office of director-general health services, said payments to members of the rapid response teams were withheld due to an inquiry by the National Accountability Bureau.
“We will clear all outstanding amounts for the teams after the completion of the NAB probe,” he said.
Dr Roghani said the rapid response teams visited people in the community when Covid-19 incidence was at its peak, and they worked diligently despite risks and challenges.
“We’re asking hospitals to start OPD-based Covid-19 screening and test people with influenza-like symptoms for the virus,” he said.
The official said the department had taken exception to the non-compliance of its contract tracing orders by district offices and decided to give every hospital specific targets.
“There will be new orders soon after the Eid break is over. We will ask district officers to achieve targets or face disciplinary action,” he said.
Dr Roghani said the health department couldn’t ignore the detection of Covid cases and would take all possible measures to ensure that all suspected cases are tested and the confirmed ones are isolated to prevent the spread of the virus to the population.
“We have the capability of detecting all Covid-19 variants at the Public Health Reference Lab, where samples can be sent by all districts for testing free of charge,” he said, adding that plans for contact-tracing of confirmed cases are also in the works.

7,Concerted efforts sought to end rivalries in Swabi,"SWABI: Political leaders have called for coordinated efforts among the jirga members, the police and religious...","SWABI: Political leaders have called for coordinated efforts among the jirga members, the police and religious figures to help end rivalries among people to ensure peaceful environment in Swabi district.  
They said both the traditional jirga system and the dispute resolution council had failed to resolve people’s feuds as an appalling surge in killings had been witnessed in recent months. 
Over 37 people were killed only in Ramazan over enmities and disputes. 
Their unanimous opinion was that the “serious issue” was that the entire system had become corrupt as those who were supposed to work for settlement of disputes were focused on their own interests instead of people’s welfare, and in such an environment how rivalries among the people could be settled through negotiations. 
Salim Khan Advocate, former provincial general secretary of Awami National Party, said people’s frustration had increased with the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities and unemployment. 
“We should not forget that violence breeds more violence. Here the people’s problem is that they look for solution to every issue through the barrel of gun,” he said, adding religious scholars should advise people to be patient and uphold the principle of tolerance and peaceful life in all circumstances. 
“Islahi (welfare) jirgas were converted into official jirgas, which caused the traditional dispute resolution mechanism to lose its glory and respect among people,” claimed Salim Khan. 
He said criminals didn’t often get the punishment because the required circumstantial evidence was not fulfilled and the benefit of doubt went to the person, who committed the crime. 
Javid Inqilabi, divisional general secretary of Pakistan Peoples Party, said there should be severe punishments for those who commit crimes. “When a country fails to ensure justice to its people, the crime rate and number of criminals increase, making the peaceful people’s life miserable,” he said. 
Mohammad Rashid Advocate, former chairman of Public Safety Commission, said inflation and ignorance among people were the main causes of the current killing spree. “In the prevailing environment, it is important that the religious scholars, jirga members and the police make coordinated efforts to end trivial rivalries and disputes among people.”

8,Chitral royal fort begins attracting crowds again,CHITRAL: The royal fort of Chitral has started attracting visitors since the election of the ceremonial mehtar ...,"CHITRAL: The royal fort of Chitral has started attracting visitors since the election of the ceremonial mehtar (ruler of the formerly Chitral state) Fatehul Mulk Ali Nasir as a local member of the provincial assembly in the Feb 8 general elections.
The residents told Dawn the 18th century fort was rebuilt by the longest serving mehtar, Sir Shujaul Mulk (1895-1936) of Katoor Dynasty, after it lost attraction for the people after the state’s merger with Pakistan in 1969.
Cultural expert Farooq Alam Jan said the fort was an historical place as the chronology of the local history revolved around it, while it also served as the centre of cultural, social, and religious activities as the monarchs kept no distance with the residents unlike other rulers of the days.
He said after the merger, the incumbent mehtar, Saiful Mulk Nasir, was inducted into the Civil Service of Pakistan and became the first ceremonial mehtar of Katoor Dynasty, who was still held in high esteem by the people.
The expert, however, said things gradually changed due to the mehtar’s postings out of the country as an officer of the Foreign Service.
He said the coronation ceremony for the current mehtar took place in October 2011, after the death of his father.
Mr Jan said the mehtar, who was 18 at that time, went to England for studies, where he first got the LLB degree from the University of Buckingham. He later received an LLM’s degree from the University of Miami.
“He came back in 2020 and started contacting people in 2022 after joining the PTI, and announced he would contest the provincial assembly election. His electoral victory has revived relations between the royal family and the common man,” he said.
Shah Murad Baig, a local intellectual with vast knowledge of history, said the fort seemed to be returning to the era of the 1930s, when the dynasty was at the peak of its strength, splendor, and magnificence.
He said the royal fort was slowly growing to be the hub where people from all nooks and corners of the district showed up to meet the MPA and the ceremonial Mehtar regarding their issues and therefore, their arrivals had increased.
“The pomp and show of the fort will reach its zenith if the ceremonial mehtar is inducted into the provincial cabinet. It will bring the maximum number of people into contact with the royal fort due to the official protocol and strength of a provincial minister,” he insisted.

The Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi has issued 2,843 visas to Sikh pilgrims who would participate in the annual festival scheduled from April 13-22.
After entering through Wagah border, the pilgrims will be hosted by the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) which has hired a train from the Pakistan Railways to bring them directly to Hassanabdal.
Taking to Dawn, ETPB Chairman Arshad Farid Khan said the board had completed all arrangements for the Baisakhi Mela, and for the first time pilgrims coming from India would use rail transport instead of buses.
“This will make the journey more safe and comfortable for the guests,” Mr Khan said, adding that the ‘technical branch’ of the ETPB had renovated accommodations and other facilities in Hassanabdal.
It is expected that around 10,000 Sikh pilgrims will converge on Punja Sahib shrine in Hassanabdal where they will celebrate Baisakhi festival. The pilgrims will also be coming from the United Kingdom, Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand and from different cities of Pakistan.
All arrangements, including accommodation, security, transport and medical needs, for the pilgrims are being managed by the ETPB.
The Indian pilgrims will be housed in hostels managed by the board while those from other countries will stay in various colleges and schools.
Baisakhimarks the first day of the month of Vaisakh in the local calendar. This year it will be celebrated on April. It is not only the spring festival in the region but also marks the founding anniversary of ‘Khalsa’.
Baisakhi is also the formal founding day of Sikhism as established by Guru Gobind Singh - the 10th Guru of the Sikhs.
During their stay, pilgrims would visit Gurdwara Punja Sahib, Gurdwara Nankana Sahib and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib.
Those from India will also visit Nankana Sahib, Gurdwara Sucha Sauda in Sheikhupura district, Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, Gurdwara Rori Sahib, Gujaranwala and Gurdwara Dera Sahib Lahore, before departing from Wagah border. However, those arriving from other countries can alter their schedules.
The Sikh pilgrims from India visit Pakistan to celebrate the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak in November, Baisakhi in April, Kartarpur Sahib as well as the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh in June and July. Many arrive at Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore.

14,Justice Ishtiaq to take oath as PHC acting CJ on Monday,Current chief justice to retire tomorrow.," 

Justice Mohammad Ibrahim

PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan will lay down his robes tomorrow (Sunday) following more than three decades of judicial career.
Senior puisne judge Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim will take the oath as acting chief justice on Monday, April 15. The second-most senior judge, Justice Ijaz Anwar, will administer the oath to him.
A notification issued by the ministry of law and justice on Friday pronounced the appointment of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim as the acting chief justice of the high court by President Asif Ali Zardari until his confirmation as the regular chief justice by the parliamentary committee for the appointment of judges.
On March 30, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan recommended the appointment of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim as the regular chief justice. Now, the decision awaits the nod of the parliamentary committee.

Current chief justice to retire tomorrow

Outgoing CJ Mohammad Ibrahim Khan served against the post for over nine months, which turns out to be an eventful period due to decisions in a large number of high profile cases. Justice Khan was initially appointed as the acting CJ to the high court on July 6, 2023, but was notified on Aug 22 for the position on a regular basis.
His admirers believe that Justice Khan assumed charge as chief justice during some unusual times as the court was flooded with cases of political nature, especially pertaining to ‘civil liberties’, and he as well as other judges of the court had provided relief to hundreds of aggrieved persons.
The high court set aside detention orders for around 1,000 people by deputy commissioners in different cities, including Peshawar, under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance.
Similarly, the PTI leaders from other provinces, who had been in hiding, also approached the high court to get transit and protective bails. They were granted transit bails under the law for approaching the relevant courts for the resolution of their grievances.
While approaching the end of his career in the high court, a letter sent to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa by Justice Khan on April 1 created ripples in the legal circles.
In that letter, Justice Khan expressed concern regarding the non-consideration for the elevation of judges to the Supreme Court from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
 

Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

In the four-page letter, Justice Ibrahim Khan said: “There were four vacancies in the Supreme Court, but only one vacancy was filled by appointing my brother, Honourable Judge Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan of Balochistan High Court the then Chief Justice Balochistan High Court.”
“It was a profound disappointment when I learned that only one judge, and that too from your own province, was appointed in the Supreme Court despite the fact that there were four vacancies. I am genuinely happy for my brother, Mr Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, but why my candidacy was not considered notwithstanding my seniority, eligibility, and availability of vacancies in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding that he was the second senior most chief justice in the country’s high courts.
During a full-court reference for him in the high court, Justice Khan said he had paid a heavy price for his recent judgements.
“In the recent political turmoil, the PHC received thousands of petitions from outside the limits of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which were decided ’virtuously within the four corners of law. Though I have paid a heavy price for my recent verdicts, I am overwhelmed to proclaim that as the chief justice of KP, I ensured the rule of law at the cost of my career progression,” he said.
Born in Swabi on April 15, 1962, Justice Khan was elevated to the high court as an additional judge on Aug 11, 2016, and subsequently confirmed as a judge of the high court on June 1, 2018.
He had joined the judicial service and was appointed as an additional district and sessions judge on Nov 1, 1993.
One of the most important jobs of his judicial career is conducting the judicial inquiry into the 2014 carnage at the Peshawar Army Public School and College, wherein 147 people, including 132 students, were killed.
He was appointed presiding officer of the commission by the PHC Chief Justice on the orders of the Supreme Court.
The said commission had conducted an extensive probe and examined 102 aggrieved people, mostly the parents of the martyred students, besides recording the statements of government functionaries of all ranks from the Armed Forces, bureaucracy, and police.
The commission had submitted its detailed report of 525 pages to the Chief Justice, Supreme Court.

15,Four Pashto movies released on Eid,"PESHAWAR: The Pashto entertainment industry has released four new movies this Eid. Also, a week-long Pashto musical...","PESHAWAR: The Pashto entertainment industry has released four new movies this Eid.
Also, a week-long Pashto musical show started on the first day of the Eid festival where film stars, stand-up comedians and folk singers performed.
The special Eid show ‘Da Akhtar Guloona’ attracted visitors and its  tickets were sold at Rs2,000 to 2,500.
Four new Pashto movies having Arbaz Khan, Ajab Gul, Shahid Khan, Mehak Noor, Sidra Ali, Jia Butt and several other noted performers in lead roles were released on Eid in city cinemas, while some old runs were also screened. The ticket per show was sold for Rs400-600.
Experts have regretted the decline of Pashto cinema and said investors and filmmakers suffered losses due to a lack of professionalism, sponsorship, good scriptwriters and passion for visual art.
Arshad Ali Shan, a film critic, blamed it on militancy and insecurity.
Producers and filmmakers said they expected a huge success due to attractive locations, engaging story lines, charming song lyrics and quality music.
They said there was a high likelihood of film buffs going to cinemas in large numbers on Eid.
The Pashto films to be screened on Eid include Bendiwan, Pekhawar Zama De, Yar Dushman and Charta Khanay, Charta Faqeeray featuring actors Ajab Gul, Arbaz, Shahid Khan, Jia Butt, Mehak Noor, and Afareen.
“Stories of these movies are related to our everyday life,” Muzaffar Khan said.
Senior film star Ajab Gul told Dawn that Pashto cinema had been struggling for survival for a few decades.
He said Pashto filmmakers and investors were striving to produce quality movies.
“I don’t claim work of high standards but still Pashto entertainment industry brings out something good for cine-goers on Eid,” he said.
Mr Gul, however, said the relevant story lines were still a far-fetched dream, while there was also a lack of playback singers.
Nazar Mohammad Zaro, a senior music composer, said music was still the strength of Pashto movies and folk artists worked hard as playback singers.
“Official patronage and public interest could boost up the image of Pashto cinema,” he said.
Young performer Rozina Khan said it was very strange that most young cine-goers took more interest in musical shows than movies.
“The reason for this trend can be live performance despite the fact that most shows have film stars,” she said.

16,Swat youth complain about illegal tree felling,Threaten street protests,"

SWAT: Social activists and youths here on Friday urgedthe forest department to check illegal tree felling.
They told Dawn that a large number of trees were unlawfully cut down in Compartment Number 8 of the Kiringal Shalpin area of Khwazakhela tehsil.
The activists said the illegal activity had threatened the local forests, and therefore, they were committed to checking it.
They said the felling of precious trees had become a thriving business, leaving the once lush green landscapes of Swat “nearly barren.”
“We can’t be just bystanders when our forests are pillaged,” youngster Syed Akbar Shah told Dawn.

Threaten street protests

Accompanied by youth men Rafiullah, Nisar Ahmad, Nazeer Ahmad, and Mohammad Jameel, he said they and social activists were committed to protecting Swat’s natural heritage from “unchecked exploitation.”
Mr Shah said the rampant deforestation exacerbated climate change, leading to a high incidence of floods in the region.
He called for immediate action to address the root causes of environmental degradation.
“The urgency to act against the timber ‘mafia’ cannot be overstated,” he said.
The youth of Khwazakhela urged authorities to step in without delay to check the activities threatening biodiversity in the region.
They said that they would first stage rallies in the area against the illegal felling of forest trees and would extend them to the entire district afterwards.
“We [youth] will convene a meeting soon to finalise our plans to block roads against both timber ‘mafia’ and the forest department over illegal tree felling,” a youngster said.
He said that the local youth were really disappointed to see the illegal felling of forests on a large scale, though the forest minister hailed from the Swat region.
“The illegal tree felling proliferated under his [minister’s] tenure. It is an appalling development,” he said.
When contacted, forest officer in Upper Swat Mohammad Waseem denied the “involvement of the timber mafia in tree felling” and insisted that the residents were chopping down trees for personal use.
“We have initiated legal proceedings against several individuals over their involvement in this illegal activity. Our range officer will soon visit the area to collect evidence,” he said.
The official said that appropriate action would be taken against the offenders afterwards.

MANSEHRA: Spat Valley in Kohistan region, which is home to unique flora and fauna, serene lakes, high mountains, springs and green meadows, is largely an unexplored tourist destination.
The valley shares boundaries with Kaghan Valley in Mansehra district.
Its Paradot area is known for its unmatched beauty. The local community stays here all through the summer season and explores “natural treasures” by traditional means and tools.
The government claims it is striving to open the province to tourists, but residents complain about its plans for eco-friendly tourism infrastructure.
Only a few nature lovers come to this picturesque valley on four-wheelers via bumpy paths from the Soach area in Kaghan Valley in the middle of July and at the start of June from Dasu, the district headquarters of Upper Kohistan.
Visitors say the locals living in mud houses at scattered places are hospitable, are fond of holding horse races on festive occasions like Eid and on the eve of August 14, and earn livelihoods by cattle and sheep farming.
The first winter snowfall occurs mostly in early November and December.
“A four-wheeler takes three to four hours to reach the Spat Valley from Soach, and visitors enjoy high mountains,springs, lakes and widely stretched greenish meadows to this heavenly piece on the earth,” Zeeshan Adil, who visited the valley along with friends, told Dawn.
He said that the beautiful valley was still a far-off sight for tourists and even the government as no roads and other tourism infrastructure existed there.
Abdul Sattar, who developed a passage to the valley from Kaghan as a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz MPA from Kohistan, said the government approved Rs13 billion in 2017 to promote ecotourism in the areabut things didn’tmove further.
“The government, with the World Bank’s financial assistance of Rs13 billion, wanted to develop the Spat Valley as an eco-friendly tourism spot under its KP Integrated Tourism Project in 2017 but this initiative is still in shambles due to the former’s lack of interest,” he said.
Mr Sattar said the project had envisioned the valley as one of the country’s ideal attractions for adventurous tourism and skiing.
“The valley’s alpine was designed for the world’s best quality potatoes and other vegetables farming and to showcase them in the country’s large markets,” he said.
Mr Sattar said the region’s low-lying part was specified for putting up ecotourism infrastructures, hotels and petrol pumps.
“The world’s best Moheen and Shamis lakes - locally known as Earth’s Eyes - feature Spat Valley. If the government goes ahead with its sanctioned project, the area can attract a large number of visitors from within the country and abroad,” he said.
