Levies officials said the body and the injured were shifted to district hospital. 
According to the officials, the downpour lashed districts Quetta, Ziarat, Pis­hin, Qila Abdullah, Chaman, Loralai, Bar­k­han, Dera Bugti, Kohlu, Sibi, Nasirabad, Gwadar, Turbat, Panjgur, Noshki, Zhob, Bolan, Chagai, Qila Saifullah, Harnai and many other areas. 
Heavy rain with thunderstorms badly hit the Buleda area of Kech district where a large number of mud houses and boundary walls collapsed due to floodwater coming from the mountains. Seasonal streams and rivers were carrying floodwater as the catchment areas in the mountains have been receiving heavy rains for the past 24 hours. 
Sources said flash floods badly affected traffic on national highways linking Balochistan with Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Some areas in northern Balochistan were cut off from their district headquarters due to flash floods. 
The downstream areas of the provincial capital, which had received heavy rain since Friday morning, were also affected and other areas faced urban flooding, causing great difficulties for the travelers and people. 
The floodwater entered many low-lying areas which damaged mud and makeshift houses, forcing the residents to move to safe places. 
The provincial government issued a high alert to all deputy commissioners and divisional commissioners to take immediate steps for shifting the people to safe places in case of flood. 
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority was also asked to remain alert for providing relief goods and launching rescue operations. 
Rain forecast
According to the Pakistan Met Depart­ment, rain-windstorm/thunderstorm is likely in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochis­tan, upper Sindh, Islamabad, Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and adjoining hilly areas over the next 24 hours. 
Heavy fall/hailstorm is also likely at isolated places in upper KP, Kashmir, northeastern/southern Balochistan and Punjab, while snowfall is also expected on high mountains in Upper Khyber.

2,‘Iran not supporting IS in Pakistan’,Denies the impression that the Biden administration’s actions have emboldened Iran.,"KARACHI: The US State Department spokesperson has denied the impression that Iran was supporting the militant Islamic State (IS) group in carrying out attacks in Pakistan.
During the daily press briefing on Thursday, Matthew Miller was asked if the US has any information about Iran supporting IS in Pakistan to carry out the recent terrorist attacks.
“...I do not have information to suggest that,” replied Mr Miller, who also denied the impression that the Biden administration’s actions have emboldened Iran.
When asked about ex-PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s claim that the current government came to power on the back of a “stolen mandate,” the spokesperson said that decisions about Pakistan are for the people and the government to make.

3,Army chief for joint efforts to safeguard hard-earned peace,"Gen Asim Munir spends Eid with troops in Miramshah, Spinwam","

WAZIRISTAN: Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir offers Eidul Fitr prayers along with troops during a visit to Miramshah and Spinwam in North Waziristan, on Friday.—PPI

 
ISLAMABAD: While emphasising the adverse impact of terrorism on development, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir has underscored a “collective imperative” to safeguard the country’s hard-earned peace, the military’s media wing said.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Gen Munir urged “all stakeholders, especially the local populace, to remain vigilant against adversarial elements seeking to destabilise the region. Maintain unwavering focus on your professional duties in service to the nation.” 
The army chief expressed these views during a visit to Miramshah and Spinwam in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa’s North Waziristan, where he joined troops celebrating Eidul Fitr, according to a Dawn.com report.
Gen Munir offered Eid prayers at the frontline, praying for the “enduring stability and prosperity of Pakistan”, the ISPR stated. “He conveyed heartfelt Eidul Fitr greetings to the troops, commending their unwavering dedication and service to the nation,” it added.

The COAS then received a “comprehensive briefing on operational readiness and the prevailing security landscape, with a specific focus on border security measures along the Pak-Afghan border”.
“Acknowledging the formation’s monumental efforts in fostering peace and stability, [the] COAS attributed these strides to the sacrifices of our martyrs, facilitating [a] secure environment conducive to socio-economic development, particularly in the newly merged districts and throughout Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the ISPR stated.
Earlier on arrival, the army chief was warmly received by the Peshawar corps commander, the ISPR said.
On the occasion, the armed forces also shared their heartfelt wishes with the nation. For soldiers, the ISPR said, the essence of Eid was found in the honour of serving their country — often far from home and the joyous gatherings of Eid. The armed forces prayed for Pakistan’s prosperity and highlighted the “courage and valour of our national heroes”, it added.

4,"Zardari, Raisi seek enhanced sharing of security information",President also invites his Iranian counterpart to visit Islamabad,"

Ebrahim Raisi

 
KARACHI: President Asif Ali Zardari, in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi, has underlined the need for enhancing the “exchange of information to overcome the security challenges” being faced by both countries, Dawn.com reported.
An official statement released by the President’s House said that the two held a telephonic conversation and exchanged greetings on the occasion of Eidul Fitr.
“During the conversation, President Zardari offered his heartfelt condolences and sympathies with the Iranian leadership and the bereaved families who lost their dear ones in the Israeli attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus,” the statement said, according to a Dawn.com report.
A part of Iran’s consulate in the Syrian capital was flattened by an Israeli airstrike, killing two of its generals and five other military advisers earlier this month. The strike marked one of the most significant attacks yet on Iranian interests in Syria, as the conflict in Gaza has rippled around the Middle East.

President also invites his Iranian counterpart to visit Islamabad

The president also expressed concerned over the “humanitarian crisis and the genocide being committed by the Israeli forces and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,” the statement said.
President Zardari assu­red his Iranian counterpart that Pakistan would continue to work with Iran in all areas of mutual interest to further boost bilateral cooperation.
“He underlined the need to enhance the exch­ange of information to ove­rcome the security challenges being faced by the two countries,” the statement said, adding that Mr Zardari also invited Mr Raisi to visit Pakistan.
“The president also wished the Iranian president and his family continued well-being, health and happiness,” it concluded.

A similar statement was also carried by Iranian news agency IRNA.
Last month, President Zardari had stressed the need for promoting barter trade and economic relations with Iran for the mutual benefit of the two brotherly countries.
The statement had come less than a week after the US again opposed the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project and cautioned about the risk of sanctions.
President Zardari said Pakistan and Iran had great scope for expanding bilateral economic cooperation in diverse fields. He expressed these views while talking to Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan, Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam, who called on him at the Presidency.

5,Protesters decry punishment for Hazara officers over Bisham attack,"Locals say incident occurred in Shangla, which is outside suspended officials’ jurisdiction","MANSEHRA: Protesters from Kohistan blocked the Karakoram Highway on Friday to protest the federal government’s punitive action against Hazara Division police officers over a failure to prevent a terrorist attack on Chinese nationals last month.
“Unfortunately, the incident has happened in neighbouring Shangla district [but] deputy inspector general of police Hazara and district police officers of Upper and Lower Kohistan have been suspended and facing inquiries,” Maulana Khairun Nas told protesters who blocked Karakoram Highway at RMB Chowk in Lower Kohistan.
Led by Maulana Wali Jan Tohidee, residents of Upper Kohistan also took to the streets and blocked the Karakoram Highway in Kamila bazaar. The protesters blocked strategic artery to traffic at both points for about two hours.
They raised slogans against the federal government, which they said had failed to take action against those who had actually failed to check the subversive attack on the Chinese nationals’ convoy in Bisham, and instead suspended the DIG Hazara, and district police officers of both Upper Kohistan and Lower Kohistan districts.

Locals say incident occurred in Shangla, which is outside suspended officials’ jurisdiction

“We strongly condemn such cowardly attack on Chinese at KKH in Shangla, but at the same time declare the federal government action against Hazara police illogical and discriminatory,” Maulana Khairun Nas said.
He and other speakers also lashed out at Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, saying that while he consoled the families of Chinese nationals, he allegedly ignored the family of a Kohistani driver who also lost his life in the attack.
“We want the [martyr’s] financial package for the Kohistani driver’s family. If the government doesn’t announce such an incentive for the bereaved family, we will continue our protest,” Maulana Khairun Nas said.
Another speaker, Maulana Mufti Raheemdad, said that the government should immediately bring to justice police officers of the Malakand Division, as the gruesome subversive activity occurred in their jurisdiction and all police officers of Hazara Division should be restored to their positions without any further delay.
So far, no banned outfit has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack. However, sources said a faction of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan was involved. 
A joint investigation committee has also been constituted by the prime minister.

6,"Non-Muslim women vulnerable to forced conversion, UN experts say",Urge govt to enforce law against forced marriages,"ISLAMABAD: United Nations (UN) human rights experts have expressed dismay at the lack of protection for women and girls belonging to non-Muslim communities in Pakistan, saying that they remained vulnerable to forced marriages and conversions, Dawn.com reported.
“Christian and Hindu girls remain particularly vulnerable to forced religious conversion, abduction, trafficking, child, early and forced marriage, domestic servitude and sexual violence,” the rights experts said in a statement issued on Thursday in Geneva.
The experts included special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, Tomoya Obokata; special rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Siobhan Mullally; special rapporteur on minority issues, Nicolas Levrat; special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Nazila Ghanea.
The chair of the working group on discrimination against women and girls, Dorothy Estrada Tanck, and members of the working group — Claudia Flores, Ivana Krstic, Haina Lu, and Laura Nyirinkindi — also joined the experts in voicing concern on the situation.

Urge govt to enforce law against forced marriages

The special rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. Special procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world.
According to a Dawn.com report, the UN experts said: “The exposure of young women and girls belonging to religious minority communities to such heinous human rights violations and the impunity of such crimes can no longer be tolerated or justified.”
They also expressed concern that forced marriages and religious conversions of girls from religious minorities were “validated by the courts, often invoking religious law to justify keeping victims with their abductors rather than allowing them to return them to their parents”.
“Perpetrators often escape accountability, with police dismissing crimes under the guise of ‘love marriages’,” they said.
The experts stressed that child, early and forced marriages could not be justified on religious or cultural grounds. They underscored that, under international law, consent was irrelevant when the victim was a child under the age of 18.
“A woman’s right to choose a spouse and freely enter into marriage is central to her life, dignity and equality as a human being and must be protected and upheld by law,” the experts said.
They stressed the need for provisions to invalidate, annul or dissolve marriages contracted under duress, with due consideration for the women and girls concerned, and to ensure access to justice, remedy, protection and adequate assistance for victims.
“Notwithstanding the right of children to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in accordance with Article 14 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, change of religion or belief in all circumstances must be free, without coercion and undue inducements,” the UN experts said.
“The Pakistani authorities must enact and rigorously enforce laws to ensure that marriages are contracted only with the free and full consent of the intended spouses, and that the minimum age for marriage is raised to 18, including for girls,” the experts said, adding that all women and girls, including those belonging to the Christian and Hindu communities, must be “treated without discrimination”.
They urged Pakistan to bring perpetrators to justice, enforce existing legal protections aga­inst child, early and forced marriage, abduction and trafficking of minority girls, and uphold the country’s international human rights obligations.

7,"PTI turned down PPP offer to form coalition, says Rana Sanaullah",Says govt will reach out to former allies who have joined PTI-led opposition alliance.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: The party that joined the PML-N in forming the incumbent coalition government had first approached the PTI, but were turned down, PML-N stalwart Rana Sanaullah said.
In an interaction with journalists on Eid day, the former interior minister said that the PTI could have formed a coalition government after the elections, if they wanted to.
“But they [PTI] do not believe in it… their stance is that we are not going to sit down, talk or compromise with any other party.”
“If the PML-N did not form a government, what would have happened? No one else was ready to do so. The PTI, which was in second place with 92 members, was not ready to talk to anyone. If they were ready to talk, PPP was ready to form a government with them,” he claimed.

Says govt will reach out to former allies who have joined PTI-led opposition alliance

Referring to the PTI, he said that if a political party adopts a stance that they did not want to talk to or work with other parties, then the country would definitely fall prey to anarchy.
Mr Sanaullah claimed that even within the party, one man — ostensibly a reference to Imran Khan — did not allow difference of opinion to thrive, while others leaders were perhaps “amenable to working alongside other political forces”.
Drawing a parallel, when asked about his absence from key party meetings in the recent past, Mr Sanaullah said that in the PML-N, differences of opinions do exist, but people abide by the party’s decision. In his view, he said that government offices should only be held by those who were elected representatives.
He said that as the party’s president in Punjab, he had attended all important meetings in the recent past and the impression that he had distanced himself from party matters was incorrect.
Talking about a grand opposition alliance that is in the offing, he said that the government of the day should always seek to take the opposition along.
Referring to Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, he said that they were allies of the PML-N in the recent past and that the government would try to remove their grievances and not allow a gulf to develop between the two.
In an off-the-cuff remark when asked about his successor, Mohsin Naqvi, Mr Sanaullah said that he, Faisal Vawda and Anwaarul Haq Kakar “belonged to the same tribe”. When a journalist opined that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb was also “from the same clan”, Mr Sanaullah chuckled and responded: “Yes, you can call him their cousin.”
When asked if they were under pressure to include members of “this tribe”, Mr Sanaullah said a coalition government has several constraints, “some of which can be mentioned and some cannot”.
Responding to a question regarding the elimination of the role of the establishment from the running of the state and the impression that the current government is a very ‘pro-establishment’ regime, he said that the establishment has a role to play in governance around the world, but bringing it under the umbrella of the law and Constitution would only strengthen democracy.
The former interior minister said: “The establishment that was there in 2010-11 was not there in 2017-18, and the establishment that was there in 2017-18 is not there today.”
He said those onkey positions at the moment had no designs to use power for their own benefit, rather they wanted Pakistan to become a stable country.
