• Raiding party booked for violating SOPs, not producing detained men before magistrate
• Punjab IGP deplores ‘misinformation’ on social media; ISPR blames ‘vested interests’
BAHAWALNAGAR / LAHORE: The Punjab government and Pakistan Army on Friday pledged  transparent investigations into a “face-off” between police and army personnel following the arrest of a serving officer, which took the social media by storm over the Eid holidays.
Four personnel of Madressah police, including the station house officer, have been booked and arrested on charges of keeping a man and his two sons, including an army official, in illegal detention, dereliction of duty and misuse of authority.
Another policeman, the Maroot police SHO, has been suspended and a departmental inquiry has been initiated against him for airing “misinformation” regarding the matter on social media.
The FIR lodged on the complaint of inspector Saifullah Hanif with Madressah police on April 10 said that former SI/SHO Rizwan Abbas, ASI Mohammad Naeem, constables Mohammad Abbas and Ali Raza arrested Mohammad Khalil and Mohammad Idrees and their father Mohammad Anwar, who were nominated in an FIR registered on April 8.
Instead of presenting them before a magistrate, the accused policemen kept them detained at the police station for more than 24 hours.
According to police sources, ASI Naeem and SHO Rizwan Abbas raided the house of Mohammad Anwar, a resident of Chak Sarkari, on April 7 for the arrest of his son Rafaqat over possession of an unlicensed pistol.
Meanwhile, Anwar’s son Mohammad Khaleel, an army official, along with his brother Idrees and other family members, took the two policemen hostage. Soon, a video of the police officers being taken hostage was uploaded on social media.
Meanwhile, a police team reached the spot, got the SHO and ASI freed and arrested Mohammad Anwar and his sons Khalil and Idrees. In process, police not only subjected the family members to severe torture but also ransacked the house. A video of this act also went viral.
Later, a case was registered against 23 family members of Mohammad Anwar by the Madressah police under sections 324, 353, 379, 506B, 342, 186, 148, 149 of PPC and the Punjab Arms Amendment Ordinance 2015.
Sources said as the Bahawalnagar district police officer came to know about the detention of army officer, his father and brother, he initiated an inquiry into the matter.
Finding them guilty, the DPO got a case registered against SHO Rizwan Abbas and ASI Muhammad Naem and constables Ali Raza and Muhammad Iqbal, had them arrested and handed them over to the A Division police.
The incident report released on April 10 said the accused policemen conducted the raid in violation of SOPs and did not inform their high-ups that the arrested included a serving army personnel. The report also confirmed police highhandedness during the raid.
Two senior police officials, requesting anonymity, told Dawn the issue had been settled before April 10 but a “malicious” campaign launched through social media did the damage.
Sharing with Dawn a couple of video clips in which the accused policemen could be seen badly injured, they said things took an ugly turn soon after Eid prayers, when almost 50 to 60 army personnel from the Bahawalnagar Brigade in around 10 vehicles stormed the A Division police station, took over the premises and severely tortured the four imprisoned cops.
Immediately after the incident, a few social media accounts uploaded pictures of police officials being tortured by army personnel.
Expressing his grief and anger over the incident, an inspector-ranked official said in a video statement that army personnel had beaten policemen like animals in front of prisoners and vandalised the police station. He said that the only fault of the policemen was that they had taken action against an army man, whose brothers were robbers. The official said that he was waiting for the Punjab chief minister to take notice of this incident.
In view of the sensitivity of the matter, the RPO immediately visited the Bahawalnagar police lines and met injured policemen and army soldiers at the DHQ Hospital.
Speaking to Dawn, Bahawalnagar DPO Naseebullah Khan said that social media users, including some police officials, had misinformed the public by wrongly highlighting the issue. “For spreading misinformation over the matter, the Maroot SHO has been suspended and a departmental inquiry has been initiated against him,” the DPO said.
An official press release said the Punjab government has formed a joint inquiry team.
“The Bahawalnagar incident is regrettable and Punjab Government has formed a Joint Inquiry Team comprising Home Department as well as state security agencies to ascertain facts and fix responsibility for this incident,” an official spokesperson said.
“To bring the matter to its logical conclusion and to ensure that those responsible for breach of laws and abuse of authority are held fully accountable without any discrimination, a Joint Investigation Team comprising army, intelligence and police authorities is being formed for impartial and independent investigation into the incident and apportion responsibility”, reads the statement of the ISPR.
IG’s statement
In his video statement released on Friday night, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar condemned the negative campaign on social media.
He rejected the allegations of delayed response saying the Bahawalpur RPO had immediately reached Bahawalnagar and army command in the area.
The incident was taken out of context and exaggerated, he said, adding that many elements shared old videos connecting them with the Bahawalnagar incident and this negative propaganda led to the disappointment among the Punjab police force.
He further said that both the Punjab police and Army have also initiated actions at their departmental level to fix the responsibilities.

1,Opposition alliance to launch countrywide drive,Protests under ‘Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan’ umbrella to begin from Balochistan today.,"• Protests under ‘Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan’ umbrella to begin from Balochistan today
• Achakzai chosen to lead bloc including PTI, BNP-M, JI, PkMAP, MWM
QUETTA: After a late-night sitting that continued till the early hours of Saturday morning, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan announced a countrywide movement for the rule of law by a coalition of six opposition parties, under the banner of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).
The movement will not only hold public meetings, starting from Pishin today (on Saturday), but also engage bar associations, university students and other parties for mustering their support for the campaign against the PML-N-led coalition government.
The PTI secretary general said that Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai was nominated as president of the six parties’ alliance with consensus of the leadership of opposition parties at the hours-long meeting, which was presided over by BNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal.
He said the movement was being launched against alleged massive rigging in the February 8 elections, with an aim to protect the constitution and resorting rule of law. The alliance rejected the ‘government’ established by tampering with the election result.
Besides the PTI secretary general, Mr Mengal and Mr Achakzai, Sunni Ittehad Council chairman Sahib­zada Hamid Raza Khan, Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen Chairman Raja Nasir Abbas and Jamaat-i-Islami leader Liaquat Baloch also attended the meeting.
Mr Ayub said the meeting rejected increase in gas and electricity rates, which made it difficult for the people to earn their livelihoods. “All political parties have joined the opposition alliance of their own will in view of the deteriorating situation in all fields,” he said.
Addressing the press conference, Mr Achakzai said, “None of us is against the army. We have objections to its political role.” He said none of the allies had breached the constitution.
“The Constitution is a social contract and we will start public meetings from Saturday for its protection,” Mr Achakzai said. He also believed there should be no extension in the service of any civil and military officer.
JI’s Liaquat Baloch said the people had been pushed against the wall as their mandate was not being accepted. He said, “I agree with the decision and announcement of the alliance meeting and we will give our stance after the meeting of Jamaat’s Shura.”
Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said that with the support of the masses, they would struggle for the rule of law.
At an earlier presser, the PTI secretary general had announced a public meeting in Pishin on Saturday (today), which will be addressed by the leaders of all the six opposition parties.
Mr Ayub said the protest movement would be initiated from Balochistan and later expanded to other parts of the country.
JUI-F inclusion?
In response to a question about the potential involvement of JUI-F in the protest movement, Mr Ayub said the matter would be discussed further in upcoming meetings of the alliance. He criticised the election results which he claimed originally showed PTI securing 180 seats in the National Assembly, a victory he said was overturned by manipulations involving Form 47, an official electoral document. “Our protest will continue until the peoples’ mandate is restored in PTI’s favour,” he said.
The PTI leader slammed the current administration under President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, labelling them as products of Form 47. He said their government did not represent the people of the country as “they have rejected the parties sitting in the government”.
Mr Ayub expressed concerns about Pakistan’s deteriorating investment climate and increasing unemployment and attributed these to the lack of rule of law. He highlighted the need to restore investor confidence through legal and constitutional reforms. “Investment will come when there is a rule of law,” he said.
He said the PTI was not allowed to hold election meetings. “Our leader was sent to jail on false cases, but they failed to keep the people from supporting Imran Khan,” he said.
Mr Ayub emphasised PTI’s commitment to regional development, particularly in Balochistan, where the party had previously initiated substantial projects. He lamented that these initiatives have stalled since the “regime change”, a reference to Imran Khan’s April 2022 ouster.

2,Justice Afridi won’t hear suo motu on ‘meddling’,Says inaction on part of chief justice or IHC should not lead SC to impose its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Yahya Afridi has recused himself from a case pertaining to alleged meddling by the country’s security apparatus into judicial affairs, arguing that inaction on the part of the chief justice or judges of the Islamabad High Court should not lead the Supreme Court to impose the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
“This may affect the functioning of the worthy chief justice and judges in their discharge of judicial functions, and would to my mind amount to interference in the independence of high courts,” said a note issued by Justice Afridi.
The note came after a seven-judge bench — led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Yahya Afridi, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Athar Minallah, Musarrat Hilali and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — had on April 3 conducted the hearing initiated after six judges of the IHC wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) accusing the intelligence agencies of interfering in judicial affairs.
“To proceed on the proposed action of suo motu would negate the lessons moved into action by public sentiments no matter how pressing the issue may appear,” Justice Afridi emphasised, adding that one must also not ignore that the high courts under the Constitution were independent establishments envisaged to regulate not only their administrative functions, but also provide security to and safeguard the judicial officers in the discharge of their judicial functions.
“In the instant matter, none can doubt the bona fide of invoking suo motu jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, but when the letter of six worthy IHC judges craves for formulating the administrative course of conduct for serving judges to not only address any intrusion of the executive in their judicial functions, their mode and manner of interaction with the executive, to judicially proceed in the present proceedings would surely lead to an adverse spectacle — a sight should be avoided,” the note said.
It added: “None can dispute that the anxiety of six IHC judges’ March 25 letter most certainly warrants positive consideration, for inserting appropriate provisions to regulate the interaction of judges with the executive and the remedial response of the judiciary to any attempt or actual interference in its judicial functions in the Code of Conduct of judges of the superior judiciary, as provided under Article 209(8) of the Constitution.”
Culture of deviancy
On the other hand, Justice Athar Minallah, also a member of the seven-judge SC bench, regretted that no one has ever been held accountable for such an interference which has created impunity for the worst form of mutilation of independence of judiciary.
In his note, the judge said the public trust in the judicial system was eroded when the court’s suo motu arisen from high court judges’ letter suggests normalisation of the culture of deviancy.
“The onus is on the federal government to establish before the Supreme Court and to assist in resolving the questions raised,” Justice Minallah said, adding that instances mentioned by the high court judges in their letter were serious and their implications in the context of the independence of judiciary were grave.
“It also reflects a culture of accepting the practice of manipulation of judicial proceedings by the executive branch of the state through interference and intimidation,” bemoaned Justice Minallah, adding that institutional response relating to the most serious and grave acts of interference in judicial proceedings and intimidation of judges could be an acceptance of practices, standards and norms which have profound consequences for the independence of judiciary.
“The letter by the six judges, therefore, raises questions regarding institutional commitment to uphold the Constitution and the independence of the judiciary.”
Justice Minallah regretted that the phenomenon of interference with and manipulation of “politically consequential matters” has remained an acceptable norm which is manifested from the unflattering role of the judicial branch for the past 76 years.
“This phenomenon has, prima facie, relegated the principle of independence of judiciary to a mere platitude. This is what has been highlighted by the six judges in their letter,” Justice Minallah observed.
“The six judges have drawn the attention of the apex court to a matter which definitely is of paramount public importance, having profound consequences in the context of safeguarding the fundamental rights of the citizens.”
Justice Minallah was of the view that it was premature for the executive to constitute a commission and, prima facie, in breach determined on the judicial side having regard to safeguarding the independence of judiciary.
“The impunity against intimidation of the judges and interference in judicial proceedings in politically consequential matters cannot be denied, rather it has been affirmed by the Supreme Court repeatedly.
“The letter of six judges confirms that the cases of Asghar Khan and Dharna could not stop interference in judicial proceedings and that the judgements are being brazenly violated. The duties of the armed forces are clearly spelt out in the Constitution stating that they will under the direction of the federal government defend Pak­istan against external aggression or threat of war, and, subject to law, act in aid of civil power when called upon to do so.
“We must not allow the honour due to those who lay down their lives for others to be undermined by the illegal actions of a few,” Justice Minallah highlighted, adding that the flagrant violations of fundamental rights of citizens and perceived failure of the courts to safeguard individual freedoms and rights severely undermines public confidence in the institution.
“The citizens would, therefore, be justified in raising questions regarding the independence of judicial. As judges of the highest constitutional court, we cannot turn a blind eye and ignore the grave abuse of powers by the executive which have consequences for individual freedoms and rights. We all know the reality but pretend to be ignorant,” the note said.
The SC order
The Supreme Court had in its April 3 order called for proposals from the main stakeholders in the judicial system and the independence of judiciary, namely the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), high courts and the federal government.
“They should suggest what should be the institutional response and mechanism to address the issues like the ones raised in the letter [of IHC judges] and ensure that such issues do not arise in future and, if they do, to fix liability and proceed against those responsible,” the order said.
In any such process, it added, the idea is to empower the high courts and their chief justices to deal with issues relating to the judges.
The court office was directed to issue the notice of this order to the PBC vice chairman, SCBA president, registrars of high courts and attorney general for Pakistan.
Since the matter involves questions as to the interpretation of constitutional law, which concern the federal government, the notices shall also be given to the AGP under rule 1 of Order 27A of the CPC, said the order.
The case will now be taken up on April 30.

3,17 laid to rest after Hub road accident,"Funerals attended by a huge number of villagers and people from surrounding areas, including Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah and local lawmakers."," 

THE victims’ relatives mourn at a hospital in Karachi.—AFP

THATTA / QUETTA: Eidul Fitr festivities in village Qasim Jokhio, near Thatta, turned into mourning  on Thursday as 17 villagers, including 12 from one family, were laid to rest after their death in a road accident a day earlier.
The victims were hea­ded to the Shah Noorani shrine in Khuzdar on Wednesday, the first day of Eidul Fitr, when the truck they were travelling in overturned and slipped into a deep roadside ditch near Hub.
The funerals were attended by a huge number of villagers and people from surrounding areas, including Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and local lawmakers.
Officials said the horrific road accident late in the evening resulted in the instant death of 13 people, who were crushed under the truck, while around 50 were injured.
Police, Levies and Rescue officials rushed to the site soon after receiving information about the accident and started shifting the bodies and injured to the Jam Ghulam Qadir Hospital in Hub.
Around 50 people were shifted to the hospital in injured condition, four of whom died during treatment, taking the death toll to 17, Dr Nasir Sheikh told Dawn.
A senior police officer, Abdul Wahid Baloch, said around 100 pilgrims from the Makli area of Thatta district were on their way to visit the shrine of Sufi saint Shah Noorani, who is revered for his role in spreading Islam in the area. The accident occurred due to speeding, as the driver lost control of the vehicle, which fell into the ditch, he said The police officer added that the pilgrims were mostly labourers working at brick kilns in Makli.

The bodies were later dispatched to their native village for burial.
The Sindh government has announced compensation for the victim’s families.
Talking to media after visiting the injured at Trauma Centre in Civil Hospital, the chief minister said his government has a procedure in place to pay Rs100,000 compensation to families of victims. “I have directed MPAs and MNAs to facilitate the affected families, and we will try to compensate the families of the victims”; he mentioned.

4,Finance Minister Aurangzeb briefs premier before maiden US sojourn,"Finance minister to attend IMF-WB spring meetings, hold bilateral meetings with Chinese, Saudi, UAE, Turkish counterparts.","• Finance minister to attend IMF-WB spring meetings, hold bilateral meetings with Chinese, Saudi, UAE, Turkish counterparts
• IMF chief urges Pakistan to address key issues before talks for new loan package
• Insists country’s economy doing better, forex reserves rising
WASHINGTON / ISLAM­ABAD: With the government set to enter into a fresh loan agreement with the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF), Minister for Finance Mohammad Aurangzeb on Friday called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and briefed him about his upcoming visit to the United States.
The finance minister discussed with the prime minister his scheduled meetings with the IMF, World Bank and other institutions, the Prime Minis­ter’s Office said in a statement.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb is due in Washington on Sunday (tomorrow) with a team of exp­erts to attend the IMF and World Bank’s spring meetings and initiate talks on a new package of around $6 billion to $8 billion.
The main ministerial meetings and events will take place April 17-19 with other events and activities taking place during the week, April 15-20.
Mr Aurangzeb and his team’s schedule includes bilateral meetings with the heads of the IMF and the World Bank, as well as other senior officials of various international financial institutions. They will also hold bilateral meetings with the finance ministers of China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, and other friendly nations attending this annual event.
They will also represent Pakistan at multilateral meetings and are expected to hold bilateral meetings with US officials, as the meetings are held in Washington.
Meanwhile, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday that Pakistan still needs to solve some “very important issues” while acknowledging that the country is seeking a new loan arrangement from the lender.
This marks her first public acknowledgement that Pakis­tan is contemplating a potential follow-up programme with the Fund after completing its current $3bn stand-by arrangement (SBA) later this month.
In their meeting, Mr Sharif and Mr Aurangzeb also deliberated over the country’s overall economic situation.
The prime minister has already said in many of his speeches in the recent past that the government have no option but to make another deal with IMF to seek a loan to stable the crippling economy of Pakistan. The agreement is likely to be inked by the end of the current calendar year. Last month, the finance minister expressed hope for reaching a staff-level agreement (SLA) with the IMF by the end of the fiscal year (June 30).
The IMF is also expected to finalise the disbursement of the last tranche of $1.1bn from the existing arrangement during these meetings.
Pakistan urged to address key issues
Speaking at an event at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, the IMF chief brought attention to the critical issues in Pakistan’s economy that demand urgent resolution.
“There is a commitment to continue on this path, and the country is turning to the Fund for potentially having a follow-up programme,” Ms Georgieva said, flagging issues that the country still needs to address.
“There are very important issues to be solved in Pakistan: the tax base, how the richer part of society contributes to the economy, the way public spending is being directed and of course, creating … a more transparent environment.”
She said Pakistan was successfully completing its existing programme with the IMF, and the economy was performing somewhat better, with reserves now being built up.
Against the backdrop of Pakistan’s evolving economic landscape, the IMF chief’s call to action indicates that the negotiations for a new arrangement could be long and arduous.
As the finance minister said last month, the specifics of the deal would be discussed during the spring meetings. The minister’s team includes the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Economic Affairs, and the State Bank governor.
Pakistan is the fourth-largest debtor nation to the IMF, with a total outstanding debt of $7.72bn. In July 2023, the IMF approved a $3bn loan for the debt-laden country, immediately disbursing about $1.2bn to help with Pakistan’s balance of payments crisis.
If the country secures the new package, it would mark its 24th bailout arrangement with the IMF. The $6bn to $8bn loan would also be its largest to date.
Earlier this month, the IMF’s Director of Communications, Julie Kozack, told reporters in Washington that Pakistan seemed interested in securing its largest loan facility with the IMF thus far. “And, of course, we stand ready to engage in program discussions in the coming months,” she added.
