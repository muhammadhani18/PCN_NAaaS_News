1,Fire engulfs Rawalpindi shanties on Eid,"Firefighters successfully brought the fire under control after an hour of intense efforts, saving numerous homes","On the first day of Eid, a tragic fire broke out due to a short circuit in the shanties near Nullah Leh at Dhok Ratta Road.
Fortunately, there were no casualties reported. Firefighters successfully brought the fire under control after an hour of intense efforts, saving numerous homes.
According to eyewitnesses, a fire broke out in a reed hut situated in a slum two hours after the Eid prayers due to a short circuit in the electrical wires. The fire quickly spread and affected numerous individuals residing in the huts.
To protect themselves, the men, women and children living in the huts fled from the scene. The excessive use of cloth and plastic materials within the huts, combined with the presence of strong winds, played a significant role in the spread of the fire.
Upon receiving information, the fire tenders of Cantonment Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122 swiftly arrived at the scene.
A spokesperson from Rescue 1122 stated that 12 firefighters participated in the operation. Demonstrating remarkable skill, the firefighters effectively brought it under control by utilising six tankers of water, targeting the centre of the blaze, he said.

2,Eid cards quietly fade into memory,Demise of once cherished tradition is attributed to the rise of social media,"The cherished tradition of exchanging Eid cards has disappeared quietly, thanks to the digital age's swift ascent.
Once a vibrant symbol of festive greetings and familial bonds, Eid cards now exist primarily in nostalgic recollections.
Rewind to the not-so-distant past, and the streets of Rawalpindi would come alive with the onset of Ramazan. Every nook and corner adorned with stalls teeming with colourful Eid cards, each one a miniature canvas of artistic expression. From humorous quips to heartfelt verses, these cards catered to every taste and sentiment.
Families, young and old, would flock to these bustling markets, eagerly selecting cards that spoke volumes in their silence. The tradition transcended borders, with cards traversing oceans to reach loved ones abroad, reciprocated by heartfelt messages from distant lands.
The golden era of Eid cards thrived until the mid-2000s, when the digital revolution began to cast its shadow. Platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and TikTok emerged as new conduits of connectivity, gradually eclipsing the tangible charm of paper greetings.
Gone are the days when postmen would play the role of messengers of joy, clutching bundles of Eid cards destined for eager recipients. The thrill of anticipation, the joy of discovering a handwritten note tucked within a card, these are now relics of a bygone era.
Mukhtar Hussain, a veteran school teacher, fondly recalls the bygone rituals of selecting and sending Eid cards. ""The arrival of Eid cards used to be awaited till the day of Eid,"" he reminisces, a hint of wistfulness coloring his words. ""Now, artificial growth has made everything beautiful, but at the cost of tradition.""
The demise of Eid cards is not merely a shift in communication methods but a reflection of broader societal changes. The allure of instant messaging and virtual exchanges has undeniably altered how we express our sentiments, trading tangible artifacts for fleeting digital interactions.
While the convenience of social media is undeniable, there's a poignant loss in the absence of tangible gestures like Eid cards. The act of choosing, writing, and sending a physical card carried a depth of meaning that transcended pixels and screens.
As we navigate this digital landscape, perhaps there's room to pause and reflect on the beauty of traditions past. The Eid card, once a symbol of enduring connection, now finds itself a cherished artifact, a testament to a simpler time when expressions of love were crafted on paper and delivered with a personal touch.

3,Visitors throng entertainment venues,Over 1m people turn up at recreational places in and around twin cities,"During the Eid festivities, families flocked to various amusement parks and scenic spots in and around Rawalpindi, including Patriata chairlift, Daman-e-Koh, and Murree, creating a lively atmosphere filled with joy and excitement. Children, in particular, had a delightful time as they explored the attractions and enjoyed the warm weather, which was complemented by the comforting cover of clouds.
The management of these entertainment venues had meticulously organised activities and facilities catering specifically to families and children, ensuring a memorable experience for everyone. Notably, the Patriata chairlift, which had been closed since 1st Ramazan, was reopened to accommodate the surge of visitors during Eid.
Statistics from the administration of major entertainment places revealed a remarkable milestone, with over one million people thronging the parks and entertainment venues over the three-day Eid period.
The festivities were further enhanced by the availability of traditional foods such as corn bread, saag, and chatti ki lassi, adding a cultural touch to the celebrations.
However, amidst the joyous atmosphere, some families raised concerns about the high prices of food items, parking fees, and ticket prices for rides and attractions. Transport services, including taxis, rickshaws, and Qingqi rickshaws, were also accused of overcharging, leading to dissatisfaction among visitors.
Responding to these concerns, park management adjusted their operating hours from the first day of Eid until Sunday, extending the timing from 9am to 1pm to accommodate more visitors. Additionally, special attention was given to boating activities at Ayub Park and Rawal Dam, as well as attractions like ghost bungalows and wildlife exhibits, which garnered significant interest from families.
The diverse wildlife exhibits featuring lions, bears, monkeys, ostriches, wolves, and African parrots were particularly popular among children, offering them an educational and entertaining experience. Other attractions such as pony rides, dodging cars, and computerised swings added to the festive ambiance, allowing families to create lasting memories together.
Across the 59 major amusement parks in the twin cities, including Ayub Park, Patriata, Jinnah Park, Joyland, and others, families continued to pour in throughout the day, enjoying the newly enhanced beautification and security measures put in place. Notably, Ayub National Park underwent expansions, offering a wider array of wildlife and attractions to visitors.
Despite the challenges faced by families with multiple children, who found it financially burdensome to indulge in all activities, the parks' administration made efforts to provide free native swings and slides for children from middle and lower-income families. This initiative aimed to ensure that all children, regardless of economic background, could partake in the festive fun.
Parking fees for vehicles and motorcycles added to the expenses, prompting some families to opt for homemade meals and snacks to mitigate the financial strain. Despite these challenges, families found joy in spending time together, engaging in sports activities like soccer and cricket, and appreciating the cultural and aesthetic enhancements of the parks.
Security arrangements, including uniformed guards and CCTV surveillance, ensured a safe environment for all visitors. However, the lack of a proper traffic control system outside the parks led to congestion and delays for normal vehicles, highlighting an area for improvement in future festivities.

4,Technology redefines traditional celebrations,Customary greetings fade in memory as new innovations make strides,"Technology advancements and the internet's widespread adoption have revolutionised how people connect globally and this shift has significantly impacted traditional customs and celebrations observed across different cultures and religions.
In the past, it was customary for individuals to personally visit friends and family during special occasions such as Eid, Christmas, Easter, Baisakhi, Holi, and Independence Day. They would bring sweets or cakes as a gesture of joy. However, with technology's rise, greetings have become more convenient through platforms like WhatsApp, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook.
This has made it easier for people to exchange Eid wishes instantly, receiving and reciprocating messages on their mobile devices.
In earlier times, festive gatherings were marked by people admiring each other's attire, enjoying delicious food, and embellishing homes with festive decorations. However, today, technology plays a pivotal role in these celebrations, with internet access and Wi-Fi being integral parts of every household. It has become customary at gatherings to inquire about the Wi-Fi password as one of the initial interactions.
According to Sobia Khan, Shakeel Durrani, and Faheem Khan, Eid and other religious festivities now heavily rely on technology. Faheem Khan noted to The Express Tribune that while traditional Eid cards are becoming less prevalent, greeting messages resembling Eid cards have become a norm in celebrations. However, he emphasized that the true essence of Eid is experienced by those who fast, contrasting it with those who merely participate in the festivities. He extended Eid wishes to both groups, underlining that the spirit of Eid is not just a formality but is also expressed through acts like sending money via Easy Paisa.
This evolving landscape reflects how technology has intertwined with age-old traditions, shaping the way people connect and celebrate during significant occasions globally.
