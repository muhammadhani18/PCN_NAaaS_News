0,Pakistan successfully repays foreign debt worth $1 billion,SBP says repayment including interest done days before bond's maturity date,"Pakistan has successfully repaid a foreign debt worth $1 billion, days before the 10-year Eurobond was to mature, increasing the confidence of global investors in regard to the domestic economy. 
""SBP (State Bank of Pakistan) has successfully executed the repayment of $1 billion Pakistan’s International Bond on April 12, 2024 (principal plus interest),"" the central bank reported on Saturday.
""The payment was made to the agent bank for onward distribution to the bondholders,"" the central bank added.
This repayment occurred on Friday, three days ahead of the scheduled maturity date of the 10-year Eurobond, which was to fall on April 15.
Following this payment, Pakistan's outstanding foreign debt from international bonds has decreased to $6.8 billion, spread across seven bonds maturing between September 2025 and April 2051.

The recently repaid bond experienced a remarkable surge in value last week, reaching a record-high price of $1 per unit, marking a significant increase from its value of less than half in June 2023.
The surge reflected strong investor confidence in Pakistan's economy.
Moreover, Pakistan's other global bonds also saw a substantial rally after the nation reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF to secure the final tranche of $1.1 billion. This rally was further fueled by Pakistan's intent to pursue a longer and larger package with the IMF in June, following the completion of the current $3 billion program in April.
The anticipated IMF tranche of $1.1 billion, likely to be received by the end of April, is expected to restore the reserves to over the $8 billion mark.
Following the repayment of the $1 billion debt in April, the country's foreign exchange reserves will experience a decline.
Pakistan had repaid the last Eurobond of $1 billion days before its maturing date in December despite facing a foreign exchange reserves crisis at that time.

1,Sikh pilgrims flock to Pakistan for pilgrimage,"Over 2,843 Indian Sikh pilgrims expected for Khalsa Janam Din, Baisakhi for 10-day pilgrimage","Sikh pilgrims from various corners of the globe, including India, are set to arrive in Pakistan to commemorate Khalsa Janam Din and partake in the festivities of Baisakhi Mela on Saturday (today).
The Indian Sikh pilgrims will be greeted at the Wagah border as they step onto Pakistani soil. The focal point of the Baisakhi celebrations will start today (April 14) at the Gurdwara Panja Saheb Hasanabdal.
Pakistan has extended visas to 2,843 Indian Sikh pilgrims, granting them the opportunity to engage in the festivities of Baisakhi Mela and Khalsa Janam Din.
Upon their arrival, the pilgrim will be received by dignitaries including the additional secretary shrines of the evacuee trust property board and the head of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Rana Shahid, the additional secretary of the evacuee trust property board, shared that following customs clearance and immigration procedures at the Wagah border, the pilgrims will be transported to Hasanabdal via a special train.
There, they will partake in the main event of Baisakhi Mela slated for April 14 at the Gurudwara Panja Saheb.
Subsequently, on April 15, the pilgrims will journey to Nankana Sahib from Hasanabdal, where they will pay homage at Sacha Sauda (Farooqabad) during their stay. This will be followed by a visit to Gurudwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur (Narowal) on April 18.
The pilgrimage will continue with a visit to Gurudwara Rori Sahib (Eminabad) on April 20, where the pilgrims will spend a day in contemplation.
The culmination of the spiritual journey will see the Sikh pilgrims bidding farewell to Pakistan on April 22, marking the completion of their 10-day pilgrimage.
Sardar Ramesh Singh, the head of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and provincial minister for minority affairs in Punjab, said that Basakhi and Khalsa Janam Day are distinct festivals.
He recounted the historical significance of Baisakhi, stating that on this day in 1699, the tenth Guru Gobind Ji founded the Sikh Panth at Anandpur Sahib.
Guru Gobind Ji mandated the Khalsa Sikhs to embrace the five articles of faith, including ‘kesh’ (unshorn hair and beard), ‘kangha’ (a wooden comb), ‘kara’ (a bracelet), ‘kachera’ (an undergarment), and ‘kirpan’ (a small curved sword or knife).

3,"No sweet exchange between Rangers, BSF on Eid","Last week, forces also skipped symbolic gesture on Holi festival","Amid tension between Pakistan and India, the forces of the two countries guarding their international borders skipped a symbolic goodwill gesture of exchanging sweets and well wishes for each other on this Eidul Fitr.
For the past many years, it has been a tradition that the border forces of both countries, the Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Force (BSF), extended goodwill on each other's religious and national festivals.
However, last week, the Pakistan Rangers and the BSF did not exchange sweets on the Hindu religious festival of Holi, as relations between the two neighbours had dipped since August 2019, when India revoked special status of occupied Kashmir.
A similar situation was witnessed on Eidul Fitr on Wednesday, when the local commanders of the border forces did not exchange sweets, a source confirmed on Friday.
Relations between Pakistan and India have remained strained since Pakistan suspended bilateral trade in response to India's unilateral move on August 5, 2019, to end the semi-autonomous status of the Indian Illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
However, despite the tensions, sweets and gifts were exchanged on important national and religious festivals during the previous caretaker government in Pakistan. Now under the newly-elected government, this process has ceased.

4,"IMF urges tax reform, transparency",Lender’s chief says Pakistan successfully completing nine-month SBA,"International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has listed tax base, more contribution from the rich, and transparency in the public spending among the important issues to be solved by Pakistan to boost its economy for a follow-up programme.
Georgieva told an event at the Atlantic Council think tank that Pakistan was successfully completing the existing nine-month $3 billion stand-by arrangement (SBA) with the IMF and that its economy was performing somewhat better, with reserves now being built up.
The global lender’s MD was speaking to the think-tank on the eve of the IMF-World Bank Spring meetings being held in Washington from April 13 to 21.
Georgieva confirmed that Islamabad was in discussions for a follow-up programme to the SBA, but stressed it had important issues to solve.
“There are very important issues to be solved in Pakistan: the tax base, how the richer part of society contributes to the economy, the way public spending is being directed and of course, creating ... a more transparent environment,” she said.
“The country is turning to the fund for potentially having a follow-up programme and there is a commitment to continue on this path,” Georgieva added, highlighting the pending issues that Pakistan still needed to address.
A Pakistani delegation, comprising Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad, Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal, and Economic Affairs Division Secretary Dr Kazim Niaz, will also be present in Washington for the meetings.
Last month, Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on the second and last review of the SBA, which, if cleared by the IMF board later this month, would release about $1.1 billion to Islamabad.
Pakistan’s external financing requirements for the next fiscal year would hover above $25 billion, which the country plans to bridge with the help of all the multilateral and some bilateral creditors.
Both sides have also spoken about negotiating a longer-term bailout and continuing with necessary policy reforms to rein in deficits, build up reserves and manage soaring debt servicing.
The Express Tribune on Tuesday reported that Pakistan’s finance minister would meet with Georgieva and other senior officials of the IMF and World Bank during his visit to Washington.
Sources told The Express Tribune that Aurangzeb was also scheduled to meet with US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Donald Lu and the deputy under secretary of treasury.
Meanwhile, the federal finance minister on Friday called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and briefed him about his upcoming visit to the US.
Aurangzeb discussed with the premier his scheduled meetings with the IMF, World Bank and other institutions, according to a PM’s Office statement. In the meeting, they also took stock of the overall economic situation of the country.

5,"PPP demands abolition of 17 ministries, new NFC award",Khuhro says Centre can save around Rs300 billion by abolishing 17 ministries,"The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Friday demanded abolition of 17 federal ministries, which were supposed to be devolved to the provinces after the 18th Amendment, and a new National Finance Commission (NFC) award.
At a press conference in Larkana, PPP Sindh President Nisar Ahmed Khuhro expressed the hope that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government would accept their demands to strengthen democratic governance and the rule of law.
Khuhro underscored that the provincial autonomy, as envisaged in the 18th Constitutional Amendment, had not yet been fully materialised. He stressed that by abolishing 17 ministries, the Centre could save around Rs300 billion.
He also called for the new NFC award in 2025, for which a committee should be formed this year. He favoured augmenting the provincial share.  ""As per the Constitution, provinces’ share can be enhanced in the award but it can't be reduced.""
When asked about the lawlessness in the Sukkur and Larkana divisions, where bandits had taken refuge in the riverbed areas, Khuhro blamed the caretaker provincial government for being lax against those outlaws.
Khuhro claimed that no meaningful action was taken against the dacoits of the katcha aras during those eight months of the interim government. He also said that the police were attacking hideouts of the bandits with the support of the Rangers.
The PPP's provincial president recalled that it took a long time to subdue target killings and other crimes in Karachi, after the Rangers launched a full-fledged operation. ""We should find out from where these criminals get advanced weaponry.""
Khuhro told reporters that the public gathering with regards to the 45th death anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto would be held in Garhi Khuda Bux, Larkana, on April 14 (tomorrow). The event will start around 3pm, he added.
The NFC Award is a critical mechanism in Pakistan's fiscal federalism. It determines the distribution of financial resources between the federal government and the provincial governments. The award is formulated under Article 160 of the Constitution of Pakistan.
The NFC Award is typically revised every five years, with the aim of ensuring equitable distribution of financial resources among the provinces based on multiple factors such as population, revenue generation, backwardness, and resource availability.
The award is negotiated among the federal government and representatives from the provincial governments, with the aim of reaching a consensus on the distribution formula. Once agreed upon, the NFC Award is implemented through a constitutional amendment.
The NFC Award plays a crucial role in fostering fiscal harmony and addressing grievances related to resource distribution among Pakistan's federating units. It is a cornerstone of the country's federal structure, aimed at promoting balanced development and addressing regional disparities.

6,EASA to assess PIA flight safety in May,Officials hope agency’s review will result in PIA-EU flight revival,"A delegation led by Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Khaqan Murtaza is set to attend a crucial meeting of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) scheduled for mid-May to review the revival of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight operations in Europe.
During the meeting, the authority will scrutinize a report on the audit of various departments of the CAA in light of EASA standards. In November 2023, an EASA team visited Pakistan to assess various aspects of the CAA and PIA, including licensing, flight safety, flight standards, and airworthiness.
According to some officials, the CAA has fulfilled all the requirements of the agency, and EASA is likely to lift restrictions on Pakistan after the safety review board meeting. If this occurs, PIA flights to Europe and the UK will resume after a prolonged hiatus.
EASA had imposed a ban on the flight operations of the national flag carrier following a PIA plane crash in Karachi in May 2020. The crash, which claimed 97 lives, later uncovered a scandal regarding the issuance of licenses to commercial pilots without proper evaluation.

7,‘IHC vested with power to deal with meddling’,Justice Yahya says invoking suo motu jurisdiction in judges letter case will have adverse effect,"Justice Yayha Afridi has noted that the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution – particularly a suo motu motion – should be sparingly exercised.
“This caution of judicial restraint should be further guarded when the matter for determination is inquisitorial, requiring a factual probe before a definite declaration, and/or, direction is rendered by this court,” the judge noted in his additional note to the SC’s April 3 written order in judges’ letter case.
Justice Afridi was part of the seven-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa that started suo moto proceedings on a letter penned by six of the eight Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges on March 26, making serious allegations about interference of intelligence agencies in judicial affairs.
Justice Afridi had recused himself from hearing the case. The SC on Saturday unveiled the written order of the first hearing of the case. The written order also contained Justice Afridi’s additional note.
The judge stated that while the issue deserved invoking suo motu jurisdiction, to judicially proceed in the case would surely lead to an adverse spectacle, “a sight I seriously urge should be avoided”.
“The letter of the six worthy judges of the IHC craves for formulating the administrative course of conduct for serving judges to not only address any intrusion of the executive in their judicial functions, but more importantly, their mode and manner of interaction with the executive.”
He said to proceed on the proposed action of suo motu would negate the lessons learnt from recent judicial precedents, adding that the SC must not move into action by public sentiments no matter how pressing the issue may appear.
“One must also not ignore that the high courts under the Constitution are independent establishments, envisaged to regulate not only their administrative functions, but also provide security to and safeguard judicial officers in their discharge of judicial functions. Law on the matter is already in the field.
“The inaction on the part of the chief justice or the judges of the high court not to exercise the jurisdiction and powers vested in him or them, should not lead this court to superimpose the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution,” he noted.
“This may affect the functioning of the worthy chief justice and worthy judges of the high court and would amount to interference in the independence of the high courts.”
He noted that the anxiety raised in the IHC letter warrants positive consideration in the shape of inserting appropriate provisions to regulate the interaction of judges with the executive and the remedial response of the judiciary to any attempt or actual interference in its judicial functions.
Justice Athar Minallah, another member of the bench, dissented from paragraph 1 to 12 of the April 3 written order.
He said the question whether the prime minister can be called on the administrative or judicial side and whether constitution of a commission to probe the letter by the executive branch of the state in exercise of its powers conferred under the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry Act, 2017 would have been in breach of the principle of independence of judiciary are yet to be considered by the full court.
“Moreover, larger benches of this court, while exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution have already exercised the power of constituting commissions and, therefore, this question is also open to be decided in this case on the judicial side by the full court.
“All these questions are likely to be considered by the full court in the present proceedings and, therefore, propriety requires that I restrain myself from commenting on these issues.""
He said the six IHC judges have brought to the attention of the Supreme Court grave and serious interference in judicial proceedings and intimidation of judges
“The six judges have sworn oaths under the Constitution and, therefore, a presumption of credibility and truth is attached to what they have highlighted in the letter unless it is rebutted.
“They have done what every judge is bound by the oath to do; uphold the Constitution and the independence of the judiciary. There is no conceivable justification to doubt their intention in bringing on record a matter of highest public importance,” he added.

8,"ATSCs resolved 137,316 cases in 2023","A total of 57,172 new cases were filed, while 62,932 cases reached resolution","Administrative tribunals and special courts (ATSC) concluded a total of 137,316 cases throughout the year 2023, according to a report from the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan.
The ATSC has released a report detailing the performance of administrative tribunals and special courts for the year 2023.
This report, as per a press release, encompasses data concerning the initiation and resolution of cases across the 324 ATSCs operational nationwide.
The report highlights a slight increase in the net number of pending cases, rising from 160,697 to 163,211, indicating a 2% upsurge. Within the same period, 137,316 cases were successfully resolved, as outlined in the report alongside a jurisdiction-wise breakdown.
Of the total, 145 ATSCs operate under federal jurisdiction, while 179 fall under provincial jurisdiction.
Under federal jurisdiction, the number of pending cases escalated by 5.7%, resulting in a net pendency increase from 121,225 to 128,111 cases. Additionally, 78,652 fresh cases were instituted, with 74,384 cases concluded during this timeframe.
Conversely, the situation appears marginally improved within the 179 ATSCs under provincial jurisdiction. The combined number of pending cases decreased by 11%, reducing net pendency to 35,100 cases from 39,472.
A total of 57,172 new cases were filed, while 62,932 cases reached resolution.
The report emphasises that a significant portion of pendency in federal courts is attributed to fiscal and service matters, primarily involving the appellate tribunal inland revenue, banking courts, and federal service tribunal, which account for 83% of total pending cases.
Similarly, in provincial courts, the backlog is largely composed of cases from anti-corruption courts, consumer courts, provincial service tribunals, and labour courts, comprising 82% of the total pending caseload.
It is underscored that relevant federal and provincial governments need to streamline court operations to reduce pendency and ensure swift delivery of justice services.
