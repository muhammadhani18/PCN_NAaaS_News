0,US football star O. J. Simpson  dies at 76,"WASHINGTON: O.J. Simpson, the American football star and actor who was sensationally acquitted in 1995 of murdering...","WASHINGTON: O.J. Simpson, the American football star and actor who was sensationally acquitted in 1995 of murdering his former wife in what US media dubbed the “trial of the century”, died on Wed­nesday at the age of 76.
His family said in a social media post that he had died after a battle with cancer.
Simpson was found not guilty in the 1994 stabbing deaths of former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in Los Angeles, although he was found responsible for her death in a civil lawsuit.
Simpson later served nine years in a Nevada prison after being convicted in 2008 on 12 counts of armed robbery and kidnapping two sports memorabilia dealers at gunpoint in a Las Vegas hotel.
Nicknamed “The Juice”, Simpson was one of the best and most popular athletes of the late 1960s and 70s. He overcame childhood infirmity to become an electrifying player at the University of Southern California and won a trophy as college football’s top player. 
After a record-setting career in the national football league with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers, he was inducted into the “pro football hall of fame”.
Simpson parlayed his football stardom into a career as a sportscaster, advertising pitchman and Hollywood actor in films including the Naked Gun series.
All that changed after Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were found fat­ally slashed in a bloody scene outside her Los An­geles home on June 12, 1994.
Simpson quickly emer­g­ed as a suspect. He was ordered to surrender to police, but five days after the killings, he fled in his white Ford Bronco with a former teammate, carrying his passport and a disguise. 
A slow-speed chase through the Los Angeles area ended at Simpson’s mansion and he was later charged in the murders.
Media circus
What ensued was one of the most notorious trials in 20th century America and a media circus. It had everything: a rich celebrity defendant; a black man accused of killing his white former wife out of jealousy; a woman slain after divorcing a man who had beaten her; a “dream team” of pricey and charismatic defence lawyers; and a huge gaffe by prosecutors.
Simpson, who at the outset of the case declared himself “absolutely 100 percent not guilty”, waved at the jurors and mouthed the words “thank you” after the predominantly black panel of 10 women and two men acquitted him on Oct 3, 1995.
The trial transfixed America. In the White House, President Bill Clinton left the Oval Office and watched the verdict on his secretary’s TV. Many black Ameri­cans celebrated his acquittal, seeing Simpson as the victim of bigoted police. 
Many white Americans were appalled by his exoneration.
Simpson’s legal team included prominent criminal defence lawyers John­nie Cochran, Alan Der­showitz and F. Lee Bailey, who often outmanoeuvred the prosecution. Prosecu­tors committed a memorable blunder when they directed Simpson to try on a pair of blood-stained gloves found at the murder scene, confident they would fit perfectly and show he was the killer.
In a highly theatrical demonstration, Simpson struggled to put on the gloves and indicated to the jury they did not fit.
Delivering the trial’s most famous words, Co­chran referred to the gloves in closing arguments to jurors with a rhyme: “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit”.

1,Myanmar rebels capture town near Thai border,Thailand’s foreign minister says his government was preparing for an influx of refugees and he urged the Myanmar junta to scale back the violence.,"MAE SOT: Hundreds of refugees crossed over the river frontier between Myanmar and Thailand on Friday following the fall of a strategic border town to rebels fighting Myanmar’s military junta.
Some said they feared air strikes by the Myanmar military after the rebel capture of Myawaddy, a town of around 200,000 people lying across the Moei River from the Thai city of Mae Sot.
“That’s why I escaped here. They can’t bomb Thailand,” said one woman, Moe Moe Thet San, a Myawaddy resident who stood in line at a border check-point with dozens of people in the heat. She had crossed the border with her young son.
Thailand’s foreign minister said on Friday his government was preparing for an influx of refugees and he urged the Myanmar junta to scale back the violence.
Thailand was also working with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to revive a stalled peace plan for Myanmar, Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said.
“It is our neighbouring country and we don’t want to see violence,” Parnpree told reporters following a visit to Mae Sot. “We want to see them talking with each other. They can use us as a broker if they want.” 
Myawaddy was wrested from military control by anti-junta forces led by the Karen National Union rebel group on Thursday. Thailand was considering alternative trade routes in case of road closures caused by the fighting, Parnpree said.
A group of 200 junta soldiers who had retreated earlier this week from their base to the Thai border were still in the area and Thai authorities had so far not received any requests from them to cross over, Parnpree said.
“They have to drop their weapons, change into civilian clothes before we would allow them to cross over the border,” he said.
This group of junta soldiers sheltering near a bridge came under attack from drones deployed by resistance groups late on Friday, local media reported.
Security in the area was tightened following the attack, with armed Thai soldiers patrolling the riverside and cordoning off some parts under one of the two bridges across to Myawaddy, according to a witness.
Junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told Myanmar media some of its troops had abandoned their base because they were accompanied by their families. Negotiations were ongoing with Thailand, he said.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the powerful military deposed an elected civilian government, triggering widespread protests it sought to crush with force.
A steady stream of people fleeing Myanmar queued at a border crossing on Friday amid tight security on the Thai side, including vehicles mounted with machine guns overlooking the Moei river.
“I am afraid of air strikes,” said Moe Moe Thet San, aged 39. 
“They caused very loud noises that shook my house.”  The loss of Myawaddy robs the junta, already grappling with an economy in free fall, of vital earnings from border trade while strengthening rebel groups, analysts say.

Sejourne said on Monday that France had no interest in talking to the Kremlin, a few days after a telephone conversation between Russian and French ministers ended in divergent accounts.
French ambassador Pierre Levy “was informed about the unacceptable character of such statements, which have nothing to do with reality”, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement, denouncing a “deliberate act” that  “aimed to undermine the possibility of any dialogue between the two countries”. A French diplomatic source said on Friday: “The Russian ministry, as usual, does not accept that we correct its lies.
“The minister recalled the reality of the exchanges and the Russian authorities’ attempt at manipulation following the call from the armed forces minister.” 
It is the latest in a series of spats between the two countries.
After a conversation between the two countries’ defence ministers on April 3, Russia said it “hoped” that the French secret services were not involved in the Moscow concert hall attack claimed by the militant Islamic State group, which killed 144 people on March 22.

3,Trump’s criminal trial to begin on April 15,He will become the first former US president to go on criminal trial.,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump goes on trial on Monday (April 15) for allegedly covering up hush money payments to hide affairs ahead of the 2016 presidential election which propelled him into the White House.
He will become the first former US president to go on criminal trial when jury selection begins next week.
Here are the key questions ahead of the landmark trial:
What is Trump accused of?
As Trump closed in on victory in the 2016 presidential election, adult film star Stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged 2006 sexual tryst with Trump.
The payments, made by Trump’s lawyer at the time, Michael Cohen, were revealed by The Wall Street Journal in Jan 2018.
Prosecutors have seized on concealment of the payments as “legal fees” in the Trump Organisation’s accounts when Cohen was reimbursed as the heart of their case.
Prosecutors say Trump “concealed the reason for these payments […] which clearly were paid in order to influence voters”, former prosecutor Bennett Gershman, now a lecturer at Pace University, said.
A New York grand jury indicted Trump in March last year over the payments made to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, with the ex-president charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. The case is being heard in a state-level court.
What is the case for the defence?
When the scandal broke, then-president Trump denied any relationship with Daniels, insisting he knew nothing about the payment, eventually claiming it was to thwart attempted extortion. He pleaded not guilty and attacked the trial as a political witch-hunt.
Trump’s lawyers will question the reliability of ally-turned-enemy Cohen’s recall, and insist the case has no merit.
Prosecutors will show that the Trump camp has form covering up embarrassing affairs with money, based on two other similar payments.
Who will decide the case?
Trump’s fate will be decided by 12 jurors, backed by six alternates, selected from a randomly chosen pool of Manhattan residents.
Each will be questioned about their view of Trump and their ability to remain impartial, with the defence, prosecution and the judge all able to bring challenges. The process could last up to two weeks.
Jurors, who must return a unanimous verdict, will remain anonymous for their protection.
Trump could theoretically be jailed if he is found guilty, with a prison sentence of up to four years for each of the 34 felony counts.
However, the judge has the discretion to impose just a fine, or alternative sentences including probation, acknowledging 77-year-old Trump’s age and clean criminal history.
Lack of remorse could go against him, but legal challenges to any sentence would likely delay sentencing. Conviction would not stop Trump’s presidential run.
How long will the case last?
The court says around six to eight weeks, with hearings scheduled every weekday except Wednesday meaning that, if guilty, sentencing could happen before the November polls.
A variety of legal challenges and manoeuvres could delay that timeline, with Trump’s lawyers stepping up their appeals and challenges in recent weeks, already securing a delay of the trial from March 25 to April 15.

Italian news agency ANSA reported that the designer died at home in Florence, the city where he was born, after a long illness.
First seen in the 1970s on stars such as Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot, his skin-baring, eye-popping styles were still favoured years on by later generations of celebrities, from Kim Kardashian to Jennifer Lopez.
Cavalli had a taste for Ferraris, fat cigars and tailored shirts unbuttoned to expose his tanned chest. He married a Miss Universe runner-up, owned a purple helicopter and a Tuscan vineyard, and was on a first-name basis with Hollywood A-listers.
Born on Nov 15, 1940, in Florence, Italy’s premier leatherworking centre, Cavalli was known for his use of printed leather and stretchy, sand-blasted jeans.
The designer was tapped in 2005 to update the Playboy Bunnies’ scanty uniform — true to form, he introduced one version in leopard print.

5,Despair makes young US men more conservative: poll,AMSTERDAM: A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established...,"AMSTERDAM: A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only US population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.
The study by the international research agency Glocalities offered context for November’s US presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.
It surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale of optimism between hope and despair, and on another between control and freedom _ in other words, conservatism and liberalism.
On average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60 per cent of the global population.
Young people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that “the surge in despair among young adults in the US far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries”.
Most strikingly, young US men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 _  or, in the poll’s terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.
In total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.
Worldwide, “feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties”, Lam­pert said, citing elections in several European countries.
Social media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing “moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views”.
Young women ‘the most liberal’ 
The report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world’s young men and young women.
Both were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.
On a scale where one represents the most conservative and five the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 last year — both easily the highest for any age group.
Men of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the US, men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.
“Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,” the report said.
Young women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, neglect.
If the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world’s men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.

Benjamin Achimeir, 14, went missing from Malachi Hashalom, an outpost near Ramallah, the Israeli army and a family member said.
The Israeli army said that air, ground, police and other forces were involved in the search, “blocking roads and scanning the area”.
Thousands of people joined them, said Israel Ganz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council which provides services to Israeli settlements in the area.
“Thousands of volunteers from across the country are searching together with army units and the council,” he said in a video statement.
“All possibilities are on the table, and all forces are treating every scenario seriously. We will remain here until we find Benjamin.” Hannah, sister of the missing teenager, said her brother was familiar with the area, where he often herded sheep.
Settler raid 
A reporter saw several Jewish settlers who were part of the manhunt raiding the nearby village of Al Mughayyir, some 500 metres west of Malachi Hashalom.
“Settlers raided the town with the excuse of searching for the missing Israeli boy,” village mayor Amin Abu Alyah said.
“They raided the village when the army arrived to back them up.” Armed with guns and stones, the settlers stormed the Palestinian village even as a muezzin urged residents to stay indoors.
In the ensuing violence, at least one person was killed and 25 wounded, the Palestinian health ministry said.
Eight of the wounded were hit with live ammunition, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
Late on Friday the army said security forces had moved to disperse  “violent riots” in the area, adding that  “rocks were hurled at... soldiers, who responded with fire”.
“Forces operated to withdraw Israeli civilians who entered the town of Al-Mughayyir,” it said.
“As of this moment, the violent riots have been dispersed and there are no Israeli civilians present within the town.” The army disclosed that one soldier was taken to hospital after being hurt “as a result of the rock hurling”.

7,Pro-Palestinian congress banned in Germany,BERLIN: Police interrupted and cancelled a pro-Palestinian conference in Berlin less than an hour after it started ...,"BERLIN: Police interrupted and cancelled a pro-Palestinian conference in Berlin less than an hour after it started on Friday, citing concerns about anti-Semitic statements.
Police initially halted the congress because one of the speakers was subject to a ban on political activity in Germany, police wrote on X.
Police did not give the name of the speaker, but participants in the congress wrote on X that it was Palestinian researcher Salman Abu Sitta.
Police then later wrote on X that they had banned the remainder of the conference, which was due to last until Sunday.
“There is a risk that a speaker who has already made anti-Semitic or violence-glorifying public statements in the past will be invited to speak again,” they said.
The conference had been heavily criticised before it began and did not disclose its location until Friday morning due to security concerns.
Berlin police on Friday said they had dispatched 930 officers, including reinforcements from other regions of Germany, to secure the event.
On the congress website, the organisers denounce  “Israeli apartheid and genocide” and accuse Germany of  “being complicit”.
Kai Wegner, the mayor of Berlin, said he found it  “intolerable” that the congress was taking place in Berlin.
“Berlin does not tolerate anti-Semitism, hatred and incitement against Jews,” he wrote.
The organisers on Friday wrote in a Telegram post that Ghassan Abu Sittah, a Palestinian doctor specialising in plastic and reconstructive surgery, had been denied entry into Germany to attend the conference.
The outbreak of the Gaza crisis has roiled Germany, where Berlin’s staunch backing for Israel has prompted protests that pro-Palestinian voices are being marginalised.

8,"Spain, Ireland and Norway ready to recognise Palestinian statehood","""The people of Palestine have long sought the dignity of their own country and sovereignty,"" says new Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris.","DUBLIN: Ireland and Spain are getting “much closer” to recognising a Palestinian state, new Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said on Friday as he met Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez.
The comments, following talks in Dublin, came hours after Norway announced during a visit by Sanchez that it too was ready to recognise a Palestinian state.
The Spanish leader is currently on a European tour, including a stop in Poland, aimed at drumming up support for the move, according to a Spanish government spokesperson.
Harris became Ireland’s youngest-ever prime minister just three days ago after predecessor Leo Varadkar abruptly quit last month.
Ireland has repeatedly signalled its intention to recognise a Palestinian state and its new leader appears eager to make good on the pledge.
“Let me this evening say our assessment is that that point is coming much closer and we would like to move together in doing so,” Harris said at a joint press conference with Sanchez.
“When we move forward, we would like to do so with as many others as possible to lend weight to the decision and to send the strongest message,” Harris added.
“The people of Palestine have long sought the dignity of their own country and sovereignty, a home that like Ireland and Spain can take its place amongst the nations of the earth.”
Sanchez added that willing countries would make their declarations “when the conditions are appropriate” and that they would support the new Palestinian state becoming “a full member of the United Nations”.
Earlier, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store echoed the sentiment that such a decision would need to be taken in close coordination with “like-minded countries”.
“Norway stands ready to recognise the state of Palestine,” Store told a joint press conference with Sanchez.
“We have not set a firm timetable,” he added.
In November, Norway’s parliament adopted a government proposal for the country to be prepared to recognise an independent Palestinian state.
Norway also hosted Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at the beginning of the 1990s, which led to the Oslo Accords.
On March 22, Spain issued a statement with Ireland, Malta and Slovenia on the sidelines of an EU leaders summit, saying they were “ready to recognise Palestine” in a move that would happen when “the circumstances are right”.
Last week, Sanchez told reporters travelling with him on his Middle East tour that he hoped it would happen by the end of June.
Store on Friday said that he welcomed Sanchez’s initiative to consult among countries to “strengthen coordination”.
“We will intensify that coordination in the weeks to come,” Store said.
The Spanish leader has repeatedly angered Israel with his outspoken comments, while Harris has already drawn a rebuke from the Israeli government this week.

10,Rights groups file fresh case against German arms export to Israel,"BERLIN: Human rights lawyers filed a lawsuit against a German government decision to approve the export of 3,000...","BERLIN: Human rights lawyers filed a lawsuit against a German government decision to approve the export of 3,000 anti-tank weapons to Israel, the second case of its kind this month filed over Berlin’s support of Israel.
Last week, Berlin lawyers said they had filed an urgent appeal to halt exports of weapons to Israel, citing reasons to believe they were being used in ways that could violate international humanitarian law in the Gaza Strip.
The latest case, brought by five Palestinians from Gaza, was supported by lawyers from the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) in Berlin and Palestinian human rights organizations, ECCHR said in a statement.
The ECCHR said the government granted export clearance for 3,000 anti-tank weapons to Israel after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, but an export permit application for 10,000 rounds of ammunition to Israel had yet to be approved.
“Germany cannot remain true to its values if it exports weapons to a war in which serious violations of international humanitarian law are obvious,” ECCHR Secretary General Wolfgang Kaleck said in a statement. The lawyers called on the Berlin administrative court to suspend the export licenses as a provisional legal protection measure.
The economy ministry, responsible for arms export permits, confirmed litigation with respect to weapons for Israel was before the court but declined to comment on an ongoing case.

11,Study finds aggressive bonobo males attract more mates,WASHINGTON: Human­kind’s two closest primate relatives are often said to embody contrasting sides of our nature:...,"WASHINGTON: Human­kind’s two closest primate relatives are often said to embody contrasting sides of our nature: peace-loving bonobos versus violence-prone chimpanzees.
But a new study published in Current Biology this week says it’s not that simple.
Male bonobos in fact fight each other more often than male chimps do — and the bonobo “bad boys” who have more dust-ups also see greater mating success.
Lead author Maud Mouginot of Boston University said she decided to investigate the question of aggression among bonobos after prior research revealed a  “reproductive skew” among males, meaning some fathered far more offspring than others.
“So the question was, if bonobos are not that aggressive, how can they have such a high reproductive skew?” she said.
Since their recognition as a species distinct from chimpanzees, bonobos have been romanticised for their free-spirited nature.
Part of their reputation as “hippies” stems from how 
they use sex as a means of conflict resolution and often have same sex couplings, especially among females. They’re also more likely to share food than chimps.
Researchers had previously attempted to compare aggression between the two species, which share 99.6 per cent of their DNA with each other, but these studies were limited because they used differing methods in the field.
Mouginot and her colleagues focused on three communities at the Kokolopori bonobo reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and two chimpanzee communities at Gombe National Park in Tanzania.
By tracking the individual behaviour of 12 male bonobos and 14 male chimpanzees over two years, the team was able to compile data on how often each engaged in aggressive interactions, who these encounters involved, and whether there was physical contact such as biting and pushing or simply charging at a rival.
Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that male bonobos exhibited higher levels of aggression than chimpanzees. Specifically, bonobos engaged in 2.8 times as many aggressive encounters and three times as many physical altercations as did their chimpanzee counterparts.
More time with females? 
Male bonobos almost exclusively reserved their aggression for other males, while male chimpanzees were more likely to become aggressive with females.
Both these findings aligned with expectations. Bonobo females are often leaders in their groups and form alliances to stop lone males who may attempt to coerce them sexually, so it makes little sense for males to challenge them.
Conversely, chimpanzees are strongly male-dominant societies, and it’s the males that band together, coercing females into sex or punishing male adversaries that challenge their authority.
The fact that male bonobo disputes are overwhelmingly one-on-one, rather than one-against-many, might explain why they happen more often, said Mouginot, as the stakes are lower. Bonobos have never been reported to kill each other.
Chimpanzee altercations, on the other hand, involve multiple males and can result in fatalities — either within their own group, or in territorial battles against rival groups. The greater costs associated with chimp combat might therefore limit how often it occurs.
As for why “nicer” bonobo males fared worse with females — “it’s possible that those aggressive males can also spend more time with females” by vanquishing rivals, said Mouginot, but this would require further confirmation.
But Mouginot, who now focuses her anthropological work on humans, is sceptical about whether “bad boy” tropes in humans — the idea that men who are troublemakers tend to attract more women — map directly onto bonobos.
Female bonobos, she emphasised, wield significant power and won’t hesitate to shut down male aggression when directed at them. But it’s possible they might find it attractive when it is directed at others.

13,Japanese to be first non-American to set foot on moon,"“America will no longer walk on the moon alone,” says Nasa chief Bill Nelson.","WASHINGTON: A lucky Japanese astronaut will become the first non-American to set foot on the moon during one of Nasa’s upcoming Artemis missions, US President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday.
The offer to Japan — an opportunity many nations have long dreamed of — came as part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s state visit, and as Washington seeks to strengthen ties with its key Asian ally.
“Two Japanese astronauts will join future American missions, and one will become the first non-American ever to land on the moon,” Biden said in a press conference with Kishida.
Kishida hailed the announcement as a “huge achievement” and announced that Japan would in return supply a rover for the programme.
Nasa’s Artemis programme seeks to return humans to the moon for the first time in over 50 years, and to build a sustained lunar presence ahead of potential missions to Mars.
Between 1969 and 1972, the US Apollo programme saw 12 Americans — all white men — walk on the moon.
Nasa previously announced that the Artemis programme would see the first woman and the first person of colour land on the moon.
“America will no longer walk on the moon alone,” Nasa chief Bill Nelson said in a video published on social media.
“Diplomacy is good for discovery. And discovery is good for diplomacy,” he added.
The first mission to take astronauts to the lunar surface, Artemis 3, is planned for 2026. China has said it seeks to put humans on the moon by 2030.
Japan’s space agency JAXA is “extremely happy” about the announcement, a spokesman said.
“We will do our best to implement the agreement,” including developing the rover for the programme, he said.
