LONDON: The Champions League came back with a bang with 18 goals across the first legs of the four quarter-
finals, a figure that’s only been surpassed once.
There were 19 goals in the four first-leg encounters of the 1956-57 European Cup and while this season’s tally is the joint-most along with 2010-11, the ties remain in the balance ahead of next week’s second legs even though Barcelona and Atletico Madrid prevailed in the opening salvos.
Birthday boy Andreas Christensen fired the winner shortly after coming on as Barca claimed a thrilling 3-2 comeback victory at Paris St Germain on Wednesday.
If Barca prevail they could face an all-Spanish semi-final after Atletico Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the day’s other game.
On Tuesday, record winners Real Madrid and title holders Manchester City played out a thrilling 3-3 draw in a game lit up by stunning strikes, and there was also no winner in Arsenal’s 2-2 draw against Bayern Munich.
The matches took place amid beefed up security after an Islamic State terror threat via a media outlet linked to the group.
Barca are appearing in the last eight of the Champions League for the first time since 2020 and coach Xavi Hernandez hailed his side’s win away to PSG, insisting it showed the Catalans could once again compete with the very best teams in Europe.
“We had time to prepare for this game and everything turned out very well, in defence and in attack. We are proud of the team. Paris played very well, but we kept their threat to a minimum,” Xavi said after Christensen’s 77th-minute header gave Barca the victory at the Parc des Princes.
Raphinha had given the visitors the lead in the 37th minute against a shaky PSG defence, only for the hosts to turn the game on its head with goals by Ousmane Dem­bele, against his former club, and Vitinha in the first six minutes after the restart.
However, Raphinha volleyed in a Pedri pass to equalise before Christensen’s winner.
Barca play the second leg at home and will like their chances to get a first semi-final berth since 2019, while PSG’s bid to finally win the elite event may end prematurely again.
“The players believe in themselves,” said Xavi as he looked ahead to next Tuesday’s return at Montjuic. “They have this opportunity, and if they play in the same way they will get chances. Nothing is done but we can be proud. This match shows that Barca are very much alive.”
It was a disappointing night for PSG, with Kylian Mbappe for once failing to deliver on a big occasion.
He scored a hat-trick on the French club’s last visit to Barca in the competition in 2021, though, and their coach Luis Enrique, who won the treble with Barcelona in 2015, is optimistic that they can still progress.
“We are going to go to Barcelona to fight a war,” he said. “I never see the opposition as favourites, whoever they are. In top-level competition, that’s how I see it. And I will continue to believe that we will go to Barcelona to win the game.
“I repeat. We could have won this game. [Football] is about small details and let’s hope that the small details go our way in the second leg.”
Meanwhile, Atletico made the most of Dortmund’s defensive mistakes to score from Rodrigo de Paul in the fourth minute and Samuel Lino in the 32nd.
But substitute Sebastian Haller kept the Germans in the tie by netting in the 82nd minute. Dortmund hit the woodwork twice in the final stages as Atletico clung on for victory.
“There were moments when we could have scored a third but the truth is that we suffered a lot in the second half. Now we need to go there [for the return in Dortmund next Tuesday] and hopefully we can win,” Atletico forward Antoine Griezmann said.
Atletico coach Diego Simeone, who recorded his 50th win in the Champions League as a coach, agreed with Griezmann about the second leg.
“We’ll go to their stadium knowing that we’re going to find a strong team, a team with a lot of people who are going to take it to us, to attack. We will have to suffer and take advantage of the spaces,” said the Argentine.
“Seeing these first elimination ties, in the four [quarter-final] matches, it’s not easy to win, so we’re happy to have won.”
INCREDIBLE GAME 
A day earlier, Phil Foden won the battle between two of England’s brightest stars against Jude Bellingham to give City the upper hand after a thrilling first leg against Real at the Santiago Bernabeu.
After falling behind to a Bernardo Silva free-kick in the second minute, Real fought back to lead 2-1 at halftime following a Ruben Dias own goal and Rodrygo strike and then built enough momentum to extend their advantage. 
But Ancelotti’s side were wasteful and missed several chances, leaving City to take a 3-2 lead with Foden’s smash into the top corner and a sumptuous rocket from Josko Gvardiol in the second half. 
Despite Bellingham’s hot streak in front of goal having cooled off, Real managed to salvage a draw thanks to a brilliant volley by Federico Valverde.
It was another epic encounter as the teams faced each other in a Champions League knockout tie for the third year running, igniting a new and exciting rivalry between the 14-times European champions and the Premier League powerhouse. 
Real eliminated City in the 2022 semi-finals but Pep Guardiola’s side gained revenge a year later at the same stage. 
The winners of the tie ended up lifting the trophy both seasons — with City crowned European champions for the first time — and the holders will aim to become the first team to knock 14-times champions Real out of Europe’s elite club competition in successive seasons since AC Milan in 1989 and 1990.
“In Manchester it will be sold out, our fans will help us score one goal, and we will try to do the rest,” said Guardiola. “It’s simple, the team who wins will be in the semi-final.”
Real coach Carlo Ancelotti said he was confident his team can shine against City next week.
“We had the grit to get back into the game, now we have a small disadvantage because we play away from home, but with the confidence that we can repeat this performance,” Ancelotti told reporters. 
Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal ensured their quarter-final against Bayern remained finely balanced thanks to Leandro Trossard’s late equaliser at the Emirates Stadium. 
Arsenal’s old tormentor-in-chief Harry Kane had ignored a hostile reception from Gunners fans to mark his return to north London with the ice-cool penalty that put Bayern 2-1 up in the first half. 
Former Tottenham Hotspur striker Ka­ne’s sixth career goal at the Emirates came after ex-Arsenal winger Serge Gna­bry cancelled out Bukayo Saka’s early opener for the Gunners and he said he felt his side had taken a step in the right direction.
Bayern, who have not gone beyond the quarter-finals since winning a sixth title in 2020, will be slight favourites for next Wedn­esday’s second leg when they will be roared on by their fans who were absent in north London as punishment for fireworks being let off in the previous round against Lazio. 
The pressure will be on Thomas Tuchel’s team, however, as Europe is their only chance of redemption in a season that will soon see them dethroned as German champions by Bayer Leverkusen. 
“You saw a real determined team today,” said Kane. “We had to show togetherness and show fight. Today was a small step in the right direction.”
In contrast to Bayern’s vast experience at this stage of the competition, Arsenal are in the last eight for the first time in 14 years. 
But Arteta retains belief his side can shock the hosts at the Allianz Arena in eight days’ time. 
“Look at the players they have, the experience they have, you get punished, but that’s part of football,” he said. “I have a lot of belief we can go there and beat them. We have to prepare really well.”

1,"Olympic athletics champions to earn $50,000, end of 128-year tradition","LONDON: Athletics has become the first sport to offer prize money to Olympic champions, announcing on Wednesday that...","LONDON: Athletics has become the first sport to offer prize money to Olympic champions, announcing on Wednesday that the 48 gold medallists in Paris this year will earn $50,000 each to end a 128-year tradition.
Although the concept of purely amateur competition has long since disappeared from the modern Olympics with athletes often receiving payments from sponsors and professionals taking part for years, the World Athletics (WA) decision is a major shift.
WA president Sebastian Coe said there had been no discussion with the International Olympic Committee, only that his organisation had given the IOC a heads-up shortly before announcing the $2.4 million prize pot.
“While it is impossible to put a marketable value on winning an Olympic medal, or on the commitment and focus it takes to even represent your country at an Olympic Games, it is important we make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is,” Coe told reporters.
“I don’t believe this is remotely at variance with the concept that the IOC often talks about, which is recognising the efforts that our competitors make for the overall success of the Games.”
Norway’s Olympic 400m hurdles champion Karsten Warholm welcomed the news.
“I think it’s good so I want to salute them for it,” he told Reuters.  “It doesn’t change my motivation to win because for the Olympics I’m not in it for the money. The gold medal is worth a lot more to me personally.”
The IOC said it was up to each International Federation (IF) and National Olympic Committee (NOC) to determine how to best serve their athletes and the development of their sports.
“The IOC redistributes 90% of all its income, in particular to the NOCs and IFs. This means that, every day, the equivalent of $4.2 million goes to help athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world,” the ruling body said.
A total of $540 million was allocated to the 28 sports at the Tokyo Games with World Athletics receiving the most at $40 million.
The amateur ethos of the Olympics, severely undermined for decades by the success of state-sponsored competitors from the former Eastern Bloc, was swept away when the IOC agreed to allow professional athletes to compete in tennis, soccer and ice hockey at the 1988 Seoul Games.
Athletics is the Olympics biggest sport by number of participants and TV audiences but the vast majority of athletes, including many medallists, face a constant struggle for funding.
Olympic silver and bronze medallists in athletics will also receive prize money, but only from the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

3,Ujah recalled to Britain’s squad after serving ban,"LONDON: Chijindu Ujah has been recalled to Britain’s 4x100m squad for the World Athletics Relays in May, 10 months...","LONDON: Chijindu Ujah has been recalled to Britain’s 4x100m squad for the World Athletics Relays in May, 10 months after serving his ban for a doping violation which resulted in his team being stripped of their silver medals at the Tokyo Olympics.
Sprinter Ujah was banned by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) for 22 months in October 2022, which was backdated from August 2021 to June 2023. However, the AIU had cleared Ujah of intentionally taking prohibited substances.
Britain were stripped of the Tokyo silver after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Ujah’s anti-doping rule violation, though former UK Athletics technical director Stephen Maguire had said he would be considered for selection again after his ban.
Ujah’s team-mates Richard Kilty, Zharnel Hughes and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake also had their medals stripped.
All four sprinters were named in an eight-man 4x100m relay squad for the World Athletics Relays in the Bahamas on May 4-5, giving Ujah another shot to redeem himself before the Olympic Games in Paris from July 26-Aug 11.

4,"Djokovic, Sinner into Monte Carlo quarters as Medvedev rages",MONTE CARLO: Novak Djo­k­­ovic avenged last year’s Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Lorenzo Musetti to reach the...,"MONTE CARLO: Novak Djo­k­­ovic avenged last year’s Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Lorenzo Musetti to reach the quarter-finals on Thursday alo­ng with Jannik Sinner, while Daniil Medvedev launched into a furious tirade during his defeat.
World number one Djokovic made a poor start and endured a second-set wobble before coming through 7-5, 6-3 against the 24th-ranked Musetti, the man who beat him at the same stage 12 months ago.
“I don’t think I am still at my top level but it was a great test today against a great player, a very talented player,” Djokovic said.
“I am really glad to overcome the challenge and lo­ok forward to the next one.”
Djokovic goes on to play Alex de Minaur, the 11th seed from Australia, in the last eight.
The Serbian top seed dro­pped serve in the opening game against Musetti bef­ore working his way back to level at 4-4, and then snatched the set on a double fault by his opponent.
Djokovic broke twice early in the second set either side of losing his own serve to surge 4-1 ahead. Musetti clawed back to within a game but Djokovic broke again for 5-3 before closing out the win.
Djokovic has struggled to find his best form in recent times in Monte Carlo. He has not won the tournament since the last of his two titles in 2015, failing to advance beyond the quarter-finals in seven subsequent appearances.
Australian Open champion Sinner improved his record to 24-1 this season with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Jan-Lennard Struff.
The world number two broke at 4-4 en route to pocketing the first set and won nine of the final 11 games to sweep to victory.
Sinner next faces Holger Rune who defeated the Ital­ian in the semi-finals last year before finishing runner-up to Andrey Rublev.
Rune made the last eight after a three-hour 30-minute 7-6 (11-9), 3-6, 7-6 (7-2) win over Grigor Dimitrov, saving two match points in the 12th game of the deciding set.
Like Dimitrov, Rune had earlier completed a rain-delayed third round clash.
Medvedev tore into the officiating for the second day running as he was beaten 6-3, 7-5 by Karen Khachanov.
Medvedev was hit with a point penalty to start the final game after berating chair umpire Carlos Bernardes and then became embroiled in a heated discussion with the tournament supervisor.
The world number four had already been warned after hurling his racquet when he double-faulted to lose his service game and leave Khachanov a game away from victory.
Medvedev, who took issue with two line calls in his second-round win on Wednesday, felt aggrieved when a Khachanov forehand was not called out during a rally that resulted in the latter earning two break points at 5-5.
The arrival of the physio to treat a finger bleed at the ensuing changeover tipped Med­vedev over the edge, with the Russian yelling  “did I ask for the physio!” at the umpire.
He then demanded of the sup­e­rvisor  “who will take responsibility?” for the decisions.
Television replays appeared to show the shot in question from Khac­hanov had landed wide of the court.
“It’s second day in a row. Guys, open your eyes. Do something. It’s out,” raged Medvedev.
“The mark is out. They don’t know how to referee anymore. Who will take action?
“Yesterday the ball is out, it’s called in. Who will take action. This ball is out there. Who will take responsibility? It’s not my responsibility to referee the matches.
“It’s this guy in the glasses [the line judge]. He doesn’t need glasses because he doesn’t see anything. He should not be a referee.” Khachanov’s reward is a quarter-final Friday against Stefanos Tsitsipas, who saw off fifth seed Alexander Zverev 7-5, 7-6 (7-3).
De Minaur moved into the last eight with a 6-3, 6-4 victory against fellow Australian Alexei Popyrin.

5,"Blundell, Foulkes called up for Pakistan Twenty20 tour","This is the first time Foulkes, 21, has been called into a Black Caps squad while Blundell, 33, has previously toured Pakistan with New Zealand.","WELLINGTON: Wicket-keeper Tom Blundell and uncapped all-rounder Zak Foulkes have been added as late call-ups for New Zealand’s Twenty20 International tour of Pakistan, the side announced on Friday.
Blundell and Foulkes will respectively replace promising batter Finn Allen and veteran paceman Adam Milne, who were both injured on the eve of departure.
Pakistan host New Zealand for five T20 Internationals starting in Rawalpindi next Thursday, as both teams tune up for June’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies.
Top-order batter Allen is out of the tour with a back injury, while pace bowler Milne is sidelined by an ankle knock, New Zealand Cricket said.
They were injured in training ahead of Friday’s departure.
“We feel for both Finn and Adam, suffering injuries so close to the start of the tour,” said New Zealand head coach Gary Stead.
“They have been strong performers for us in the T20 format since the last World Cup.”
This is the first time Foulkes, 21, has been called into a Black Caps squad while Blundell, 33, has previously toured Pakistan with New Zealand. He will provide wicket-keeping and top-order cover.
“Tom is a highly experienced player and along with his wicket-keeping and batting skill sets is a leader in any group he is a part of,” Stead added.
Foulkes has caught the eye of the Black Caps selectors with impressive bowling figures for Canterbury in domestic competitions.
“We also know he has skills with the bat and it will be an excellent opportunity for him to be part of the group,” Stead added.
New Zealand won 4-1 in a home five-match T20 series against Pakistan in January.

6,"Liverpool humbled by Atalanta in Europa League, Roma edge Milan","""Unfortunately, there is nothing really positive to say about the game,"" says Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.","LEVERKUSEN: Liverpool slu­m­ped to a shock 3-0 home defeat by Atalanta on Thursday as Gianluca Scamacca struck twice for the Italian side in their Europa League quarter-final first leg.
On a chastening evening for former European champions in the continent’s second-tier club competition, AC Milan lost 1-0 at home to fellow Italian side AS Roma. Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leve­rkusen secured a last-gasp 2-0 home win over West Ham United.
Atalanta took the lead at Live­rpool after 38 minutes when an unmarked Scamacca latched on to Davide Zappacosta’s cross to strike a low shot past keeper Caoi­mhin Kelleher who should have done more to keep the effort out.
Scamaca pounced on poor Liverpool defending to fire home from a fine cross by Charles De Ketelaere in the 60th minute before Mario Pasalic sealed the rout seven minutes from time with a simple finish off a rebound from Kelleher.
“Unfortunately, there is nothing really positive to say about the game,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told TNT Sports.
“I know already that if we do a couple of things better, we will be better. Can we win it back? Yes, if we play good it is possible. Can we win 3-0? I have no idea. But this feels really bad and that’s important.”
Meanwhile, late strikes by Bayer Leverkusen substitutes Jonas Hofmann and Victor Boniface earned the Bundesliga leaders a two-goal advantage over West Ham and they remained undefeated this season with 37 wins and five draws across all competitions.
 

LEVERKUSEN: Victor Boniface (second R) of Bayer Leverkusen heads to score during the quarter-final first leg against West Ham United at BayArena.—Reuters

Leverkusen dominated the game but the visitors’ keeper Lukasz Fabianski pulled off a string of saves and kept out dangerous efforts by Alejandro Grimaldo and Patrik Schick to keep the scores level at the break.
Hofmann gave Leverkusen the lead in the 83rd minute, scoring with a first-time effort and striker Boniface doubled the advantage in stoppage time with a header into the bottom corner.
“It’s not luck, it’s for a reason,” Alonso told reporters of his side’s habit of winning late. “When it was 0-0 you could try and overreact and lose control while  trying to score. We didn’t want to do that.We wanted to insist and we  wanted to keep going.”
The hosts, who can clinch the Bundesliga title on Sunday, had 33 attempts on goal — 13 on target — compared to one sole effort by midfielder Mohammed Kudus for Europa Conference League holders West Ham.
In Thursday’s other fixture, Roma upset hosts Milan as Gianluca Mancini scored to end the capital club’s nine-match winless run against Stefano Pioli’s side.
Roma, who had last beaten Milan in 2019, took the lead thanks to Mancini’s pinpoint header from Paulo Dybala’s corner in the 17th minute.
“We should have been more courageous,” Milan coach Stefano Pioli said.  “We created some chances, but I didn’t see the same quality as in the last matches.
“This team can do more, I know that. I didn’t expect the defeat, we weren’t precise, we lacked the flair.”
Elsewhere, Portuguese champions Benfica claimed a 2-1
home win over Olympique de Marseille through goals by Rafa Silva and Argentine forward Angel Di Maria.
In the Europa Conference League fixtures on Thursday, Aston Villa inched closer to a first European trophy in more than four decades with a 2-1 win over Lille.
Ollie Watkins and John McGinn scored either side of half-time to give  the Premier League highflyers a serious option on the semi-finals ahead  of next week’s quarter-final return leg in France.
Villa, who  crushed Ajax 4-0 on aggregate in the last 16, are aiming to claim their  third continental title following their victory in the European Cup in  1982 and the UEFA Super Cup the following season.
The gloss was  slightly taken off their night’s work when Bafode Diakite scored for the  visitors with six minutes left on the clock.
“We’ve had a lot of opportunities and 2-1 is a bit disappointing, I think it should have been three or four,” reflected Watkins. “We have a game plan and we stick to it no matter what,” he added.
The winners of this tie will advance to face either Greek giants Olympiakos or Fenerbahce of Turkey.
This  pair met earlier Thursday in Greece with Fenerbahce’s tumultuous week  continuing as they mounted a stirring second half fightback in a 3-2  loss.
The Turkish outfit appeared to be down and out after an  hour’s play, with their Greek hosts bossing the quarter-final first leg  by three goals.
Kostas Fortounis and Stevan Jovetic put Olympiakos  firmly in control by half-time, with Chiquinho consolidating their  advantage on 57 minutes.
But a 68th minute penalty from Dusan  Tadic followed by Irfan Can Kahveci’s 74th minute contribution gave  Fenerbahce a lifeline ahead of next week’s return leg in Turkey.
“We started strongly, but Olympiakos are a very good side and they  converted their opportunities. After falling 3-0 behind, we managed to  regroup, play our game and increase our chances to qualify,” commented  Tadic.
Elsewhere, Fiorentina, last season’s beaten finalists in Europe’s third-tier  continental competition, were held to a goalless draw at Viktoria Plzen  in the Czech Republic.
The winners of this tie will go on to face  the winners of the meeting between Club Brugge of Belgium or PAOK of  Greece, with Brugge leading 1-0 ahead of next week’s return leg.

“Next week, on April 17 at 10am, we will put 250,000 new tickets on sale for all sports, all price categories and for all competition sites,” Tony Estanguet told reporters, urging interested fans to be  “quick” because of high demand.
With the clock ticking down to the opening ceremony on July 26, Estanguet said he was confident that the huge organisational and security challenges faced by the organising committee would be overcome.
“We’re ready. We’re ready for this final straight,” he added.  “We’ve built up a lot of confidence and peace of mind.”
He noted that construction work was often  “the biggest challenge that poses problems for the organisation of the Games”, but that the Paris 2024 team had taken possession of its facilities on deadline and in some cases ahead of time.
“The timetable has been perfectly respected which is a relief for us,” he said.
He also expressed  “confidence” in French security forces who will be responsible for the safety of fans and athletes at a time when France is on its highest warning level for terror attacks.
The opening ceremony being planned on the river Seine — the first time a summer Olympics have started outside the athletics stadium — is set to mobilise 45,000 members of the security forces.
“We want to organise major Games, spectacular Games,” he explained.  “We’ve never backed away from this. We’ve always showed audacity.”
The ticket release next week is expected to be one of the last major opportunities to secure seats.
Following criticism of high prices during previous rounds, Estanguet stressed that half of them would be sold for under 100 euros ($108).
A total of 10,000 tickets for gymnastics will be made available, with 15,000 for swimming, 12,000 for tennis and 35,000 for beach volley, which is set to be played in a temporary stadium in front of the Eiffel Tower.
Two-thirds of previous buyers were French, but people from 150 different countries have also secured tickets, according to the organising committee.
The Olympics are set to take place from July 26-Aug 11 followed by the Paralympics from Aug 28-Sept 8.

9,"DeChambeau storms into Masters lead, Scheffler one back","""Today was a great test of golf, and I was able to conquer a very difficult golf course,” says DeChambeau.","AUGUSTA: LIV Golf’s Bryson DeChambeau used a sizzling burst of late birdies to muscle into a one-shot lead over Scottie Scheffler on Thursday as Spaniard Jon Rahm’s Masters title defence got off to a shaky start.
After a storm delayed the start of the year’s first major by 2-1/2 hours, 2020 US Open champion DeChambeau thrived in the softened but windy conditions and mixed eight birdies with one bogey for a seven-under-par 65.DeChambeau, who raised eyebrows in 2020 when he said the par-72 Augusta National layout for him played more like a par-67, enjoyed a fast start as he opened with three consecutive birdie putts, none longer than six feet.
The only blemish on DeChambeau’s card came at the par-four ninth where he three-putted from 70 feet but he went on to scorch the back nine with five birdies over a hot six-hole stretch that he capped with a 31-foot birdie putt at the 17th.
“I have a level of respect for this golf course that’s a little bit different than a couple years ago, and clearly today was a great test of golf, and I was able to conquer a very difficult golf course,” said DeChambeau, who is one of 13 LIV Golf players in the field.
“Regarding the 67 comment, you know, you mess up. I’m not a perfect person. Everybody messes up. You learn from your mistakes, and that was definitely one.”
World number one and pre-tournament favourite Scheffler, playing in a high-profile group with Grand Slam-seeking Rory McIlroy and Olympic champion Xander Schauffele, also rode a late birdie blitz to card a bogey-free six-under-par 66.
Scheffler, the 2022 Masters champion, was two under through 11 holes but caught fire with four birdies over his next five to pull within a shot of DeChambeau.
“I did a good job of staying patient today,” said Scheffler.  “We kept the golf course in front of us. And, I mean, I executed some really nice up-and-downs to keep the round going.”
McIlroy, who missed the cut in last year’s Masters and is making his 10th attempt at completing a career Grand Slam of golf’s four majors, opened with a 71 while world number five Schauffele carded a 72.
Sitting in the clubhouse alone in third place was 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett, who is making his first start since undergoing shoulder surgery in September and only decided on Sunday that he would play this week.
The 36-year-old Englishman reached the turn at three under but two bogeys over his next five holes knocked him out of contention until he birdied three of the final four holes.
“I think I might take the next six months off,” Willett joked after his opening 68.  “No, it’s completely unexpected. Sometimes that happens, whatever. You make a couple of birdies and your mind starts thinking, all right, I can do it.”
LIV Golf’s Rahm, bidding to become the fourth golfer to successfully defend his Masters crown, launched his title defence with a one-over-par 73.
Rahm reached the turn riding high after two consecutive birdies moved him to two under but he endured a shaky back nine that included four bogeys.
“It’s a difficult golf course. That’s all I can say,” said Rahm.  “It’s not easy. You’re not really having the luxury out there of being able to miss shots, especially tee shots. Unfortunately, on that back nine I missed a few too many shots.”

10,Eight SA venues confirmed for 2027 World Cup,"In addition to the South African grounds, matches will also be played in Zimbabwe and Namibia, who will co-host the tournament.","JOHANNESBURG: Eight venues in South Africa have been confirmed for the 2027 World Cup, according to Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Pholetsi Moseki.
In addition to the South African grounds, matches will also be played in Zimbabwe and Namibia, who will co-host the tournament.
Moseki told the South African News24 website that the eight South African venues had been chosen for what he described as  “scientific” reasons, including proximity to an airport and the availability of hotel rooms.
South Africa’s regular Test venues — the Wanderers in Johannesburg, SuperSport Park in Centurion, Newlands in Cape Town, Kingsmead in Durban and St George’s Park in Gqeberha — will all host matches.
The Mangaung Oval in Bloemfontein, Boland Park in Paarl and Buffalo Park in East London will be the other venues.
All eight grounds were used when South Africa previously hosted the World Cup in 2003.
Benoni, Potchefstroom and Kimberley also staged matches in 2003 but were not included for the 2027 edition.
The tournament is scheduled for October-November 2027.
The Wanderers, which is South Africa’s premier venue with a capacity of about 30,000, hosted the finals of the 2003 World Cup and inaugural 2007 T20 World Cup and a semi-final of the 2009 Champions Trophy.
Newlands is a scenic ground with a backdrop of Table Mountain, and has hosted more Test matches (60) than any other South African ground. It was the venue for the 2023 Women’s T20 World Cup final and a 2007 T20 World Cup semi-final.
The SuperSport Park is a purpose-built stadium outside Pretoria, which hosted the 2009 Champions Trophy final.
Kingsmead was the venue for semi-final of the 2003 World Cup and 2007 T20 World Cup.
St George’s Park is South Africa’s oldest Test ground which staged a semi-final in the 2003 World Cup while the Boland Park is a scenic venue in the Cape Winelands. It hosted three matches in the 2003 World Cup.
Bloemfontein’s Springbok Park has staged five Test matches as well as two matches of the Super Six stage of the 2003 World Cup.
Buffalo Park has infrequently used for men’s international matches in recent years but it has hosted one Test match as well as being a Super Six venue in 2003.
