0,Tessori’s future uncertain after PPP demands his removal,MQM-P terms Waqar Mehdi’s criticism of governor ‘non-serious’.,"KARACHI: The fate of Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori hangs in the balance after the Pakistan Peoples Party publicly demanded his removal from the office.
The ruling party in Sindh accused him of “creating a political divide and further widening the gap between urban and rural areas of Sindh” and asked the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led government in the Centre to remove him from the post.
Mr Tessori’s party — the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan — issued a statement in his favour and against the PPP’s demand, terming it completely “unnecessary and non-serious”.
The demand took many by surprise as Mr Tessori’s appointment as Sindh governor, who was a nominee of the MQM-P, was made with consent of all parties in the Pakistan Democratic Movement government in October 2022 a few months after the ouster of prime minister Imran Khan.

MQM-P terms Waqar Mehdi’s criticism of governor ‘non-serious’

The PPP, however, insisted that its demand was part of its deal with the PML-N under which fresh appointment of governors in all provinces was agreed while ‘failure’ of Mr Tessori to prove his ‘competence’ to serve as a representative of the federation in the province was also at play.
It all started with a statement made by senior leader of the PPP Sindh chapter who sought immediate removal of Mr Tessori.
“He [Tessori] has failed to bring an end to political and urban-rural divide. Instead of delivering his role as representative of the federation in the province, he has created more divide and further widened the gulf between urban and rural areas” said Senator Waqar Mehdi, the PPP-Sindh general secretary.
“The PML-N should decide early about the appointment of a new Sindh governor and by the time, the decision is made, the Sindh Assembly speaker can serve as the acting governor,” he demanded.
Speaking to Dawn, the PPP leader sounded more critical towards Governor Tessori than the MQM-P.
When asked about possible reaction of the party if the PML-N-led federal government decides to bring another nominee of the MQM-P to replace Tessori, Senator Mehdi said it was not PPP’s concern.
“It’s not ours’ [PPP] but their [PML-N’s] issue. They can appoint anyone they want whether anyone from the MQM-P. Our point is that when we entered into an agreement with the PML-N to support its government [in the Centre] it was decided that the governors would be replaced,” he said.
“Secondly, we all have seen the performance of Mr Tessori. He has failed as representative of the federation and it’s damaging both for the Centre and the province,” he alleged.
In response to the PPP demand, the MQM-P came up with a strong reaction. However, it underplayed the significance of Senator Mehdi by calling him only a “leader on paper within the party”.
“Waqar Mehdi doesn’t even enjoy any significance or key role in the PPP and his statement is worthless,” said provincial lawmakers belonging to the MQM-P in a statement.
“In such crisis time, the PPP should come forward with its straightforward viewpoint. The PPP should review its own 15-year governance in Sindh. It doesn’t have any right to comment on the performance of the Sindh governor,” they added.
Meanwhile, later, a meeting between the governor and Dr Asim Hussain, a close aide to President Asif Ali Zardari and senior PPP leader, at the Governor House generated speculations about the future of Mr Tessori.
However, both Governor House and the spokesman for Dr Hussain claimed that the meeting had no political agenda.
“Dr Asim only came to extend Eid greetings to Governor Tessori. The meeting should not be presented in any other aspect,” said a Governor House statement following almost a similar ‘clarification’ issued by a spokesman for Dr Hussain.

Actors Ali Rehman and Mehwish Hayat at the event.—Dawn

 
KARACHI: It is almost inevitable that if you arrange an event on chaand raat, guests will trickle in late. That’s understandable. And if a film premiere is organised the evening before Eid at that, well, people will arrive at the venue with pleasure… and rather leisurely.
Daghabaaz Dil, directed by Wajahat Rauf, had its opening night for the media and showbiz glitterati on Tuesday evening, and the principal cast of the film — Mehwish Hayat, Ali Rehman, Momin Saqib, Salim Sheikh and Tazeen Husain — came to the red carpet area at Nueplex Cinema a little after the given time on the invitation cards. 
Again, that’s understandable, no grousing, because next day was Eidul Fitr. The media was there, as were a decent number of showbiz celebs who joined in to support the cast and crew of the movie, perhaps because it was the only major Pakistani cinematic release on the festive occasion.
While familiar faces of actors and actresses, both young and not-so-young (but still want to be counted as the former), were surrounded by their fans for selfies or media persons for a quick chitchat, this writer was pleasantly surprised to see former federal minister, author and filmmaker Javed Jabbar at the function. It was the right opportunity to pick his brain on the film being released and the general state of cinema business in Pakistan. 
Mr Jabbar said, “Anything in 2024 that helps activate the Pakistani cinema has to be good.”
He was of the view that considering the context, it’s fine that not many releases are taking place. “It’s a sign of focus, deliberate initiative being taken, high risk but very commendable.”
On the question of why Pakistani filmmakers tend to go for rom-coms, he replied, “Because there are not enough cinemas, and not enough people willing to go out and take the risk of watching good cinema. I hold people responsible for it, not the filmmakers… Filmmakers are waiting for the people to come and support cinema.”
After the usual photo-ops and casual exchange of pleasantries, the guests walked into the cinema hall and the film began at 10:17pm.

A son of the deceased teacher was also gunned down in the same area some months ago.

4,SHC for continued action against  profiteering in city,KARACHI: The city commissioner has informed the Sindh High Court (SHC) that various meetings have been held with...,"KARACHI: The city commissioner has informed the Sindh High Court (SHC) that various meetings have been held with retailers of milk, grocery, meat, poultry and other commodities in order to maintain the official price of various essential items.
The commissioner, in his comments, stated that directives had also been issued to the deputy commissioners (DCs) and other officials to enforce official prices of commodities and take strict legal action against profiteering.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi directed the commissioner and other respondents to enforce the official price of essential commodities.
At the previous hearing, the SHC had summoned the commissioner since he had failed to file comments in a petition filed against the sale of various essential commodities at exorbitant rates in the city.
At the outset of the hearing, an official appeared before the division bench and informed it that the commissioner could not turn up since he was busy before the Supreme Court and filed comments/compliance report on the behalf of the commissioner.
The commissioner in his report also stated that price magistrates had conducted raids in the districts of South, Korangi, Malir and Central during Ramazan and sealed 30 shops, imposed fines of Rs24,323,500 and lodged 2,153 cases.
The report also maintained that meetings were also held with the chairman of market committee Karachi, and chiefs of the middlemen associations of fruit/Sabzi Mandi and others so that supply of fruit and vegetables were ensured for its auction and availability in various parts of the city. 
The chairmen of all such associations assured the commissioner that officially notified rates of essential commodities would be implemented in the markets, it stated. 
Many DCs also submitted similar reports in respect of their districts.
It also ordered them to continue legal action against the violators under the relevant laws and submit further progress reports by April 30.
Citing the chief secretary of, director general of the bureau of supply & prices, commissioner Karachi, deputy commissioners and others as respondents, Advocate Shahmir Baloch submitted in his petition that the fruits, vegetables and other essential commodities were being sold in the market at much higher prices in violation of the official price list issued by the commissioner office during Ramazan.
He stated that despite such contraventions, the respondents had not been taking any action whatsoever against those unscrupulous persons.
He also placed on record the copies of price list and argued that the daily commodities were being sold at exorbitant rates, which required penal action and sought directives for the respondents to check the prices of such commodities and take necessary legal action.
It is also said in the petition that every year with the beginning of the holy month, the prices of essential commodities, including fruits, vegetables and pulses as well as edible foods, started swelling and rather become beyond the approach of most of the people in the absence of any proper mechanism to enforce official price list.
The petitioner further maintained that the authorities concerned appeared to be helpless instead of dealing such matter with iron hands to compel sellers to sale such commodities at official rates.

5,"Job opportunities will be created to curb street crime, says Sharjeel","HYDERABAD: Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon has attributed rising street crime graph to unemployment,...","HYDERABAD: Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon has attributed rising street crime graph to unemployment, illegal immigrants and price hike, and pledged creation of job opportunities in the farm and industrial sectors to lessen youths’ dependence on government jobs.
He said that agriculture and industrial sectors would be strengthened to create job opportunities. 
He said that efforts were being made by the chief minister, home department and provincial police chief to control street crime.
He was speaking to journalists at his residence here after offering Eidul Fitr prayers on Wednesday. 
He also expressed his party’s views on some judge’s recent moves and said “judges should give up double standards”.
“Letters are being written for a convict who has been sentenced only a few months back; why didn’t judges write letters on excesses committed against politicians of Sindh?” he wondered.
He claimed that Justice Saqib Nisar had supported [Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman] Imran Khan in every possible way whereas [Pakistan Peoples Party leader] Asif Zardari had been kept in jail for 14 years without having been convicted. 
“Why didn’t judges write letter on Asif Zardari’s imprisonment or unjust hanging of [PPP founder chairman] Zulfikar Ali Bhutto?” he argued. 
He further claimed that the judiciary did have evidence of foreign funding in PTI still it was being supported; and the party’s another leader, Qasim Suri, was granted stay order by Justice Umer Atta Bandial. 
He viewed such things as double standards of judiciary, and remarked that “some particular people are supported and their actions are facilitated by the system as well”. 
In this regard, the minister also recalled that one PPP leader was disqualified for not showing a member of his family in his declaration but such an identical point in Imran Khan’s case was treated as his personal matter.
PPP’s policies
He said Asif Zardari [who has just started his second tenure as head of the state] had previously introduced positive policies. He claimed that Mr Zardari’s successive visits to China [during his previous tenure] had given Pakistan the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) but the project at that time had been criticised. Later on, however, other political parties started claiming credit for it, he noted, and said that Mr Zardari “prefers trade over aid”.
Agriculture sector
Sharjeel Memon observed that Pakistan had fertile lands but the farm sector and rural areas had not been paid due attention by other ruling parties. However, PPP always focused this sector and rural areas in terms of development. He pointed out that wheat had to be imported during Musharraf regime and when PPP government headed by Mr Zardari started paying due attention to this sector and increased wheat support price, Sindh produced bumper crop and had now become in a position to even export the commodity. 
BISP
The provincial information minister also recalled that the Benazir Income Support Programme launched by the PPP used to be criticised by the party’s opponents but it greatly helped collect the data that was now being used in the wake of disasters and natural calamities for providing relief to affected people.
Bus service for Mirpurkhas 
The minister said the Sindh government was bringing about an improvement in the transport sector, and announced that Peoples Bus Service was being launched in Mirpurkhas shortly. Introduction of electric buses in Karachi was also under consideration, he added.

Her family members mounted a search for her when she went missing. Her body was finally spotted in the well and retrieved by rescuers. 
The girl, Bushra, along with her father Rajab Ali Pathan, and other family members, was enjoying a visit to the amusement park when she went missing. They are residents of Pathan Goth, Latifabad, Unit-7.
When the family failed to find her, Rajab reported the matter to the nearby A-Section police station.
As the number of visitors started to drop, one of the girl’s pair of sandals was found lying outside a room located within the park. The sandal was recognised by the family. They found a wide abandoned well inside the room and feared that the girl might have fallen in it.
Relatives and friends of Rajab also arrived at the site and tried to use a ladder to descend into the well but they found it too deep. SHO Munir Abbasi and Rescue 1122 staff also arrived though too late, according to the family.  
A crowd had gathered around the room as the news of the incident had spread like a wildfire. Police dispersed the crowd. 
In the meantime, the girl was found and retrieved from the well after six hours of efforts by the Rescue 1122 staff. It was shifted to the Bhitai Hospital, Latifabad, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.

8,Govt measures against crimes to take some time to show results: Khuhro,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, whose party has ruled the province  for about 15...","LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, whose party has ruled the province  for about 15 years and has taken over its reins for another five years, holds eight-month hiatus of caretakers’ rule responsible for deteriorating law and order conditions in the province.
Khuhro said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Friday that the PPP government had made crucial changes in police department to enhance its capacity for maintaining law and order. Although, the situation could not be improved overnight, the efforts being made and the measures being taken in this regard would definitely show positive results, he added. 
About the mysterious disappearance of a minor girl, Priya Kumari, close to three years ago,  he said: “The incident required to be probed thoroughly”. The new joint investigation team (JIT) formed for the purpose was working on it and would soon submit its report, he said. 
He sought refuge in comparing law and order conditions under previous governments, counted the incidents during Gen Musharraf’s  and other Martial Law regimes when asked to comment on obtaining conditions in the province. 
He said that ‘intention’ was of paramount importance in curbing crime and eliminating criminals. “We must keep an eye over the supply routes of sophisticated weapons into the province and their falling into the hands of outlaws,” he asked.
Khuhro advised all political parties to put their heads together and brainstorm with the sole objective of arriving at a consensus for strengthening democracy in the country and ending economic crisis.
Accompanied by Abdul Fatah Bhutto, former president of PPP Larkana district, he disclosed that though his party was not part of the federal government, it (PPP) had demanded the Centre form a committee for the issuance of new National Finance Commission Award and devolve 17 federal ministries in line with the spirit of the 18th Amendment. “However, we are still waiting for a response,” he said. 
He said the provincial autonomy promised in the 18th Amendment was yet to be given to the province. Currently, Sindh received a meagre share of 24 per cent in the NFC Award from 57 per cent shares of the provinces, he said.
He proposed that all political parties should sign a charter for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation forum, which would help all to move forward. 
He announced his party would hold a big public meeting on April 14 in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto. It was earlier scheduled for April 4 but was put off due to Ramazan.
Khuhro said in answer to a question about delay in the second phase of expansion of Sindh cabinet and said that under the 18th Amendment, the size of the provincial cabinet could be 18 ministers and five advisers. “But you are not satisfied in both conditions whether the cabinet is smaller or bigger,” he said pointing towards journalists. 
Renowned artist Ayub Khoso, who is a member of the Sindh Human Rights Commission, was also present at the presser.

Talking to reporters in Sakrand on Friday, Chandio said that when honourable judges of courts were themselves shouting for justice for their own families and judges were in such miserable condition where members of general public should look for justice.
He said that the parliament which had been brought into being through an arrangement carried no mandate. The interim setup before elections had greatly weakened Irsa as the province’s water share as per 1991 accord was not being given to Sindh, he said.
He said pointing to powers that be that they said until Punjab’s dams were not filled, Sindh’s water would not be released. Punjab was releasing sewage into Indus River which was destroying agriculture of Sindh, he claimed.
Chandio said that whether it was government of Pakistan Peoples Party, PML-Nawaz or Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Sindh had always remained deprived of its share of water.
He criticised PPP for its poor governance in the province for last 16 years and said the PPP leaders were now selling gunny bags whereas growers were forced to sell their wheat at a lower price.
He said that billions of rupees were spent on law and order maintenance in Sindh, still dacoits’ culture was ever-flourishing.
G.M. Syed had already said that Sindh would never get justice through parliament where thieves were sitting whereas judges were not deciding cases on merit.
He announced holding protest sit-ins throughout Sindh on Sunday and urged people to join the party’s peaceful protest against dacoits’ culture and water shortage.

In a statement issued here on Friday, the WAF said that Dua Solangi’s body was found in a banana orchard in Kalhora Colony, Tharu Shah on Wednesday and she was said to have been molested before being murdered.
The killing of the accused in the case, Zameer Siyal, in a police encounter was equally worrisome as cases of killing suspects in such cases had shown a rise and such extrajudicial actions must stop, it said. 
It said that the accused must have been examined medico-legally and their DNA should have been matched to prove that the suspect was indeed involved in the case. Besides, it would have proved that no staged encounter had taken place and evidence had been obtained against the accused, it said.

Accuses police of delay in launching search for victim

It said that had police taken timely initiative for the recovery of the girl such incidents could have been avoided. 
It was unfortunate that despite receiving reports about missing children police did not make 
serious efforts to recover them, it said. 
It said that police should improve their performance if it was serious to stop such incidents. 
Instead of killing the accused in staged encounters police were required to complete investigations into such cases to avoid extrajudicial actions, said the WAF.
Assault suspect killed in encounter: police  
Naushahro Feroze police on Friday claimed killing the accused wanted in criminal assault and murder of a minor girl in an encounter.
Police sources said that the body of the suspect identified later as Zameer alias Zammu Siyal was shifted to Naushahro Feroze Civil Hospital where autopsy was conducted. 
The post mortem on the victim’s body revealed that the child 
was sexually assaulted and died from strangulation, said the sources.
The girl’s family registered a case after which police party led by Tharu Shah SHO Rafiq Bohio and Naushahro Feroze SHO Asad Nabi raided a place near Naushahro Feroze link road to arrest the accused. 
The sources said the accused opened fire on police to avoid arrest, police retaliated and shot dead the accused who was later identified as Zameer alias Zammu Siyal.
The police claimed recovering a weapon from his possession. 
The body was shifted to Naushahro Feroze Civil Hospital for autopsy.

He said that the law and order situation worsened due to a major reshuffle in the police department by the caretaker government before the general elections.
“The reshuffle affected the entire policing system,” he told reporters in Thatta, adding that the caretakers had transferred officers from additional inspectors general to SHOs as if all of them were his own men. 
He said that improving law and order in the province, particularly in Karachi, was his government’s top-most priority, according to a statement issued from the CM House.
“The government is taking strict measures to improve the overall law and order situation, including in Karachi, rural areas, and particularly in the riverine area,” he said, adding that the PPP government had restored peace across the province in the past, and it was committed to ensuring the same.
CM Shah mentioned that Karachi was ranked as the seventh most dangerous city in the world by the International Crime Index before 2008. “But we restored law and order after coming into power and when we left the government in 2023, the same city of Karachi had improved its ranking and was ranked 128th on the same Index,” he said.
He said that he had taken it as a challenge to restore peace to protect life, liberty, and property of the citizens.
He said that his newly established government had arrested not only a significant number of street criminals during targeted operations in Karachi but also many bandits in riverine area.
Mr Shah stated that the police and Rangers were conducting a joint operation against the dacoits in the Katcha area of Kashmore.

16,"Teenage boy, minor girl die after consuming ‘contaminated water’ in Karachi’s Nazimabad",Supply of impure water continues to play havoc with people.,"KARACHI: Contaminated water supply continues to play havoc with people’s lives, killing two children in a Nazimabad locality and making hundreds of others ill across the city during the Eid days, it emerged on Friday.
Sources said 14-year-old Abbas and six-year-old Malika died on the first day of Eid after remaining ill with acute watery diarrhea for some days. They were residents of Union Council 49 (Jalalabad), part of Nazimabad.
They said there were speculations about a cholera outbreak in the locality with at least 25 children ill with acute watery diarrhea and vomiting. But the disease couldn’t be confirmed through a laboratory test.
“A team of the health department and water board immediately reached the spot. While we couldn’t get any lab report from the parents on disease diagnosis or collect samples for lab confirmation, what was evident to all officials was the highly contaminated water being supplied to the locality,” shared a health department official.
The water, he pointed out, was visibly contaminated and stinking, and had worms that could be seen from the naked eyes.

Supply of impure water continues to play havoc with people

“The cause of children’s death could not be confirmed but the specific conditions we saw there left no doubt in our minds that the continued consumption of contaminated water killed the children,” he said, adding that more than 20 children were ill in the same locality with acute watery diarrhea and vomiting.
According to the official, the team couldn’t meet the parents of the deceased children as they had left for their village. 
“The team distributed chlorine tablets amongst the residents, most of them illiterate, and counselled the families on water use. The locality had countless illegal water connections.”
The health services director Karachi wasn’t available for comments.
Gastroenteritis, mainly with acute watery diarrhea, has gripped the city for almost a month. Most experts put the blame on the use of contaminated water for drinking purposes as a paucity of gas and its soaring prices has forced many people to use water without boiling.
At the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK), Additional Medical Superintendent Dr Liaquat Ali Halo shared that the number of gastroenteritis patients was persistently high.
“Out of the 800-900 cases that are currently being reported at our main emergency unit during the Eid holidays, 50 per cent pertain to acute watery diarrhea,” he said, adding that the condition had a high fatality rate among malnourished children.
“Often, parents prepare milk for their children in contaminated water. Hence, their illness quickly takes a serious turn and they go into shock.”
Seconding his opinion, Dr Altaf Hussain Khatri, senior general physician representing the Pakistan Medical Association, said there was no let-up in gastroenteritis cases.
“I had my clinic today (Friday) and more than half of my patients were ill with gastroenteritis. None of them was using boiled water for drinking,” he said, adding that he ran his clinic in the old city area.
According to him, contaminated water is often the breeding ground for hosts of infections that can wreak havoc on the digestive system and lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea.
“Gastroenteritis is a broader term used for all illnesses causing inflammation of the digestive system, including cholera. This inflammation could be caused by viruses and bacteria, toxins, parasites, particular chemicals as well as certain drugs,” he explained.
