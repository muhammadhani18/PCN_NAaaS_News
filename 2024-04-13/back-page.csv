• Tel Aviv claims aid trucks allowed into north; UN seeks IDF hotline for aid agencies
GAZA: A surprise ground assault on Thursday followed by Israeli bombardment from air, land and sea claimed dozens of lives on Eid day.
Residents of Al-Nusseirat camp reported that several houses and two mosques had been destroyed, while officials said at least 25 people had been killed and several wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Al-Daraj neighbourhood.
At least 89 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli military strikes in the span of 24 hours, the health ministry said.
On Friday, the health ministry said that at least 33,634 people have been killed and 76,214 wounded in the territory during more than six months of Israeli violence.
Mohammed al-Rayes, 61, told AFP that he fled Israeli “air strikes and artillery shelling” in Nuseirat, central Gaza overnight.
“It was all fire and destruction, with so many martyrs lying in the street,” he said.
Another resident, Laila Nasser, 40, reported “shells and missiles” throughout the night.
“They will do to Nuseirat what they did to Khan Younis,” said Nasser, vowing to flee to the southernmost city of Rafah, like most of Gaza’s population.
Separately, Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. One man was killed when Israeli soldiers opened fire on his vehicle in the city of Tubas, Wafa reported.
Another Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli gunfire when troops raided Al-Fara refugee camp near Tubas, the agency said.
Meanwhile, Turkish state television said one of its journalists in Gaza was badly wounded and another injured after they were targeted by an Israeli strike.
“The vehicle of a team from TRT Arabi (TRT’s Arabic-language channel) that was preparing to broadcast from the Nuseirat camp… was targeted by an Israeli army strike,” the broadcaster said.
“Sami Shahada, a freelance cameraman, was badly wounded,” it added.
TRT’s chief Zahid Sobaci said Shahada had “lost a foot and is currently in surgery”, calling the attack “Israeli brutality”.

Aid trucks
The Israeli army claimed on Friday that an undisclosed number of aid trucks were allowed to enter Gaza a day earlier through a newly opened crossing in the north.
“The first food aid trucks entered through the new northern crossing from Israel into Gaza yesterday,” the Israeli agency that oversees supplies into the territory said on X.
A video the agency released in the tweet showed military vehicles and at least one truck laden with pallets full of tightly wrapped white bags entering Gaza.
“The trucks underwent thorough security checks by the security authorities of the Land Crossings Authority of the Ministry of Defence at the Kerem Shalom crossing, and were accompanied by IDF (army) soldiers,” the Israeli army said in a separate statement.
But despite repeated AFP requests for comment, Israeli authorities did not disclose how many trucks entered Thursday nor the exact location of the new crossing, which Israeli media reported to be close to the Zikim kibbutz.
However, the United Nations has called for a direct hotline to Israeli forces fighting in Gaza to combat mistrust and deliver aid safely and effectively.
Rather than going through liaison bodies, the UN and other humanitarian actors “need to be speaking to people who are firing guns”, outgoing UN humanitarian coordinator Jamie McGoldrick told a press briefing in Geneva.
“If we have a serious security incident, we don’t have a hotline,” he said, speaking by video-link from Jerusalem.
“The IDF have never worked with humanitarian organisers before in this type of environment. They don’t understand how we function, they don’t understand our language and what our purpose is. And we don’t understand their expectations.
He said agencies had been warning Israel about the flawed notification system before the April 1 fatal attack on staff from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity.
Since the WCK attack, which killed seven aid workers and triggered an international outcry, McGoldrick said: “I don’t think there’s been any notable improvement in terms of our ability to move around”, and humanitarian workers “fear for their own safety”.

1,US sends reinforcements to Middle East as Israel on edge for Iranian retaliation,Fears of reprisal for attack on Damascus embassy grow.,"• Fears of reprisal for attack on Damascus embassy grow
• India, France and Russia warns citizens against travel to region
• Diplomatic sources say Tehran wishes to avoid escalation, won’t act hastily
JERUSALEM: As Israel on Friday nervously awaited an attack by Iran or its proxies in retaliation for the last week strike on Iran’s embassy in Damascus, the United States said it was sending reinforcements to the Middle East.
“We are moving additional assets to the region to bolster regional deterrence efforts and increase force protection for US forces,” said a US defence official in Washington, a key ally of Israel, amid fears of retaliation for the strike.
Countries including India, France and Russia have warned their citizens against travel to the region, already on edge over the escalation in attacks on Gaza.
The Israeli military said it had not issued fresh instructions to civilians, but that its forces were on high alert and prepared for a range of scenarios.
“The revenge will come,” wrote Israel’s largest daily newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth. “For the moment, the premise is that it will be very soon, in the next few days.”
Israel’s foreign ministry did not comment on reports that some Israeli diplomatic missions had been partially evacuated and security stepped up.
Israel did not claim responsibility for the April 1 strike on the embassy in Damascus where a senior commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ overseas Quds Force, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, and six other officers were killed.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Israel and said it “must be punished and shall be” for an operation he said was equivalent to an attack on Iranian soil.
“It’s going to be very difficult for Iran not to retaliate,” said Raz Zimmt, senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. Since Iran viewed the embassy attack as equivalent to an attack on its own territory, Zimmt said a direct attack on Israeli soil by Iran itself rather than a proxy was a ‘real possibility’.
Iran has missiles capable of hitting Israel directly.
However, Zimmt added, “I still believe that Iran doesn’t want to engage in full-scale, direct military confrontation against Israel, and certainly not with the United States. But it has to do something.”
Reprisal threat ‘real’: White House
Meanwhile, the US Middle East envoy has called the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Iraq to ask them to deliver a message to Iran urging it to lower tensions with Israel, a source with knowledge of the situation said, as the White House said Iran’s threats of reprisals against Israel after the strike in Syria remain ‘real’.
“We still deem the potential threat by Iran here to be real, to be viable,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists.
President Biden earlier on Wednesday warned that Iran is “threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel.” He pledged “ironclad” support for Israel despite diplomatic tensions over its military conduct in Gaza.
After a meeting with the head of US Central Command, General Michael Kurilla, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav
Gallant said: “We are prepared to defend ourselves on the ground and in the air, in close cooperation with our partners, and we will know how to respond,”
‘Iran wants to avoid escalation’
However, Iranian sources and diplomats from the US, Israel’s main protector, say Tehran has signalled to Washington that it wishes to avoid escalation and will not act hastily.
But the risk remains that any response might spin out of control.
Iran’s message to Washington was conveyed by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian during a visit to the Gulf Arab state of Oman, which has often acted as an intermediary between Tehran and Washington, the sources said.
Sources said Iran believes Israel aims to draw Tehran into a war, therefore its retaliation could be a restrained one that avoids direct strikes on Israeli territory.

2,"Pakistan not added to list of ‘dangerous nations’, say UK officials",Indian media reports had wrongly reported that Pakistan was “off limits” for travel according to a UK government advisory.,"LONDON: British High Commission officials have denied media reports claiming that the UK government had added Pakistan to the list of dangerous countries.
In a recent update, the Foreign and Common­wea­lth Development Office (FCDO) has added eight additional destinations, including Israel and Gaza, to the list of places deemed ‘too dangerous’ for UK citizens to visit.
Indian media reports, as well as some local websites, had wrongly reported that Pakistan was “off limits” for travel according to a UK government advisory. But officials told Dawn there was no change in Pakistan’s travel advisory status which was last updated on January 24, as per the UK government’s website.
Several reports mentioned a ‘black list’ and ‘red list’, misstating that Pakistan was included in the latter, but officials confirmed to Dawn that there were no black or red lists and that each country has its own travel advice.
The UK’s FCDO has similar travel advisories for both India and Pakistan. “FCDO advises against all travel to within 10 miles of the border between Pakis­tan and Afghanistan” and “the Line of Control,” says the advisory for Pakistan.
The warning for India is identical to Pakistan, and UK citizens are warned against travelling to Manipur and parts of India-held Kashmir.
The advisory for Pakis­tan also warns against tra­v­e­lling to KP and Baloch­istan areas, including Bajaur, Bannu, Buner, Charsadda, D.I. Khan, Khyber, Kohat, Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Lower Dir, Mohmand, Orakzai, Peshawar, Swat, Tank, North Waziristan, South Waziristan and Gwadar.
‘Too dangerous’
The eight countries declared ‘too dangerous’ to travel for UK citizens are Ukraine, Iran, Sudan, Leb­a­non, Israel, Belarus, and the Palestinian territories.
They have joined Afgha­n­is­tan, Syria and Yemen, already designated as high-risk destinations.
The expansion of the ‘too dangerous’ list underscores the ongoing volatility and threats present in these regions.
With conflicts and tensions escalating in several areas, the FCDO has urged British nationals to avoid non-essential travel to these destinations for their own safety.
The FCDO regularly issues travel advice for its citizens to consider before making travel plans to other countries.

3,Ismail Haniyeh’s three sons killed in Israeli strike,"Funeral prayers offered for slain men in absentia in Karachi, JUI-F chief writes to Hamas leader","CAIRO: Three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the family said. 
The Israeli military confirmed carrying out the attack, describing the three as operatives in Hamas’ armed wing. 
The three — Hazem, Amir and Mohammad — were killed when the  car they were driving in was bombed in Gaza’s Al-Shati camp.  Four of Mr Haniyeh’s grandchildren, three girls and a boy, were also killed in the attack. 
The three sons and four grandchildren were making family visits  during the first day of the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday in Shati, their  home refugee camp in Gaza City, according to relatives. “The blood of my sons is not dearer than the blood of our people,” Haniyeh, 61, who has 13 sons and daughters according to Hamas sources, told pan-Arab Al Jazeera TV. 

Funeral prayers offered for slain men in absentia in Karachi, JUI-F chief writes to Hamas leader

Meanwhile, Israeli media reports on Thursday suggested that the strike was carried out without consulting senior commanders or political leaders, including embattled PM Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Quoting senior Israeli officials, the Walla news agency said neither  Netanyahu nor Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had been told in advance of  the strike, which was coordinated by the Israeli military and the Shin  Bet intelligence service.
Grief in Pakistan
The killing of Mr Haniyeh’s sons saw an outpouring of grief in Pakistan, with JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman writing to Mr Haniyeh to condole over the deaths and the Jamaat-i-Islami offering funeral prayers in absentia.
In his letter to the Hamas chief on Thursday, Mr Rehman said targeting families and children of Hamas leaders was an “admission of failure” by Israel, Arab News reported.
“The blood of these martyrs will not go in vain,” he said. “We support Hamas’ efforts in the fight [against Israeli occupation of Palestine].”

4,Ailing pope to make 12-day Asia trip in September,"VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis will visit Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore in September, the ...","

Pope Francis, 87, will travel to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore in September, according to the Vatican.—AFP

 
VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis will visit Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore in September, the Vatican announced on Friday, an ambitious trip that could test the 87-year-old’s increasingly fragile health.
Running from September 2 to 13 and covering around 30,000 kilometres (18,600 miles) in total, the trip is the longest for the Argentine since he became head of the worldwide Catholic Church in 2013.
The Vatican said he would visit Jakarta from Sept 3 to 6, Port Moresby and Vanimo from Sept 6 to 9, Dili from Sept 9 to 11 and Singapore from Sept 11 to 13.
The visit, his first abroad since September last year, has been on the cards for months, but the pontiff’s health issues had raised questions on whether it would go ahead.
Francis pulled out of a key Easter event at the last minute in March, and has asked aides to read several of his speeches in recent weeks due a bout of bronchitis.
The pontiff, who uses a wheelchair, has suffered increasing health problems in recent years, from knee pain to surgery for a hernia and on his colon.
Francis had been due to visit Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Indonesia in September 2020 but the trip was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Tolerance, unity and peace 
Involving more than 30 hours of flight, an eight-hour time difference and a series of meetings and masses, the September trip will represent a major physical challenge.
The government in Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, had already announced the pope’s visit last month, describing it as a “special gift” for the country’s Catholics.
On Friday, its foreign ministry said the visit was important ‘for all religious communities’. 
“The visit is also expected to strengthen the message of tolerance, unity and world peace,” it said.

5,Biden ‘considering’ Australian request to drop Assange case,"‘Do the right thing. Drop the charges,’ Assange’s wife Stella writes on X.","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he was “considering” a request by Australia to drop the prosecution of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on espionage charges.
Australia’s parliament passed a motion in February with the prime minister’s support calling for an end to the legal saga surrounding Assange, who has been held in Britain since 2019 while fighting extradition to the United States.
“We’re considering it,” Biden replied at the White House when asked by a reporter if he had a response to Australia’s request.
Biden, who took the question while walking with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to a meeting in the Oval Office, did not elaborate.

‘Do the right thing. Drop the charges,’ Assange’s wife Stella writes on X

Australian citizen Assange, 52, has been indicted by the US government over his role in the 2010 leaking of a huge trove of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
If convicted, he faces jail terms of up to 175 years.
In response to Biden’s comments, Assange’s wife Stella said on social media platform X: “Do the right thing. Drop the charges.”
She said it was a “good sign” that US President Joe Biden was “considering” dropping the WikiLeaks founder’s prosecution. “It looks like things could be moving in the right direction,” Stella told the BBC.
“It’s a good sign. The prime minister of Australia (Anthony Albanese) overnight said that he is optimistic,” Stella told the BBC.
She has previously said Assange’s physical and mental health are in decline in jail and that her husband “will die” if sent to the United States.
Assange and his supporters say he exposed US military wrongdoing and see his case as a fight for media freedom. Washington says his leaks put lives at risk by publishing documents that included the names of intelligence sources.
He is currently waiting to learn if he can make a last-ditch appeal against extradition, after a British court last month delayed a decision on his case. It is now expected on May 20.
In late March, the High Court in London gave the US three weeks to provide further “assurances” on his treatment if he is sent there to face charges.
Political solution
WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson earlier on Wednesday called for “a political solution” to Assange’s plight, as supporters rallied in central London on the eve of the fifth anniversary of his arrest.
“This is a case that just should never have been started in the first place,” Hrafnsson said at the rally.
He said Assange’s time in the high-security Belmarsh Prison in southeast London was “so excessive and so brutal.”
Hrafnsson said Canberra should link the case to its landmark AUKUS security pact with Washington and London to secure Assange’s release.
“They should be bold and say we have nothing to discuss unless you drop the charges against Julian Assange so he can walk free and come back to Australia,” he said.
Before going to prison, Assange spent seven years in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced accusations of sexual assault which were later dropped.
Campaign groups including Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders have called for his release and denounced the prosecution under the 1917 US Espionage Act, which has never been used over the publishing of classified information.
