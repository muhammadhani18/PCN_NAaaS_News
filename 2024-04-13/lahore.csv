“The definition of child in the 1929 Act while making a distinction on the basis of age, is not based on an intelligible criteria having nexus with the object of the law,” Justice Shahid Karim observed in a judgement passed on a public interest petition. 
The petition by Azka Wahid challenged the definition of “child” contained in the 1929 Act as amended and substituted by the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 2015, to criminalise the child marriage in the province. 
The petitioner was represented by Barrister Hamza Shahid and Barrister Daraab Wali. 
The lawyers urged the court to declare section 2(a) of the 1929 Act unconstitutional on the ground that offend the equality clause in the Constitution. 
The section 2(a) reads “child” means a person who, if a male, is under 18 years of age, and if a female, is under 16 years of age. The judge noted that a brief filed by the advocate general office made a reference to Islamic jurisprudence regarding the age of puberty as the traditional interpretative toolkit. 
The judge said medical science, too, supports the notion of a female attaining puberty at an age which materially differs from that of a male. But that does not necessarily lead to granting a licence in the hands of a parent or guardian to marry off a female child, he maintained. 
“The right question to ask is whether notwithstanding the appearance of signs of puberty differently in males and females, the government is empowered to prescribe a minimum age for marriage or not?,” the judge remarked. 
The judge rules that there is no prohibition in the Constitution on prescribing a minimum threshold for marriage and, therefore, to criminalise child marriage. 
He says the theme of the 1929 Act is to “restrain the solemnisation of child marriage.” 
However, the judge notes that the purpose has been muddled by providing different ages for males and females for which there is no intelligible criteria. 
The report by the advocate general states several factors behind the legislation, saying that in Pakistan, many children are victims of child marriage and the burden of child marriage is disproportionately borne by girls as opposed to boys. 
It says that early marriage excludes children from education and makes them vulnerable to various health complications. 
It points out that as many as 21 percent of girls are married before the age of 18 years and three percent before reaching 15 years in the country, according to Unicef database 2016, based on Demographic Health Survey of Pakistan 2012-2013. 
The report also quotes the recent Demographic Health Survey of Pakistan (2017-2018), which says although on an average the age of marriage of girls is increasing, but a deeper analysis of the data shows that child marriage at the age of 15 years has also increased from 1.6 to 1.8 percent. 
Justice Karim observed that this makes a compelling case based on physiological and sociological factors for the executive to step up and take effective measures to counter the debilitating effect of child marriage. 
“We, as a nation, woefully lag behind in all major indicators and half of our population cannot be lost to child-bearing at an early age, while its potential remains untapped,” the judge laments in his judgement. 
He maintained that equal opportunities for females mean equal restraint on marriage as the males. 
The judge says the 1929 Act (and its amendments) is a step towards the fulfillment of duty by the state under Article 35, which provides that the state shall protect the marriage, the family, the mother and the child. 
Justice Karim observed that the mandate of Article 35 was not lost on the legislature while enacting the 1929 Act. But, for some reason, which cannot be discerned, unmistakable partisan slant has muddled the clear stream of policy objectives animating the 2015 amendments. 
He notes that the difference in ages (of males and females) in the definition of “child” was left unchanged in the 2015 amendments and it does not comport with the mandate of Article 25, which ensures that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law and there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex. 
“I have no doubt in my mind that the definition of child, in its present form, in 1929 Act, is discriminatory,” Justice Karim remarked. 
The judge declared that the words in section 2(a) of the law, “if a male …and if a female is under 16 years of age” are unconstitutional and of no legal effect. 
“They are struck down,” he ruled. 
The judge ordered the Punjab government to issue a revised version of the 1929 Act (based on this judgment) within the next 15 days and also upload that version on its website for information.

Identified as Abbas and Ali Haider, the suspects were allegedly running a criminal gang in the name of ‘Topi Gang’.
According to the police investigations, Abbas and Ali Haider were the security guards, one offering services at a private bank while the other at a private business outlet. They used to commit street crime at night. 
They were allegedly eliminated in a police counter some 24 hours after they killed a young girl Aniqa in front of her father and another man during a looting spree on 27th night of Ramadan.
Thousands of Shahdara Town residents took to the streets soon after the encounter and surrounded police vans, showered them with flowers and raised slogans in favour of police.
Several teams of the police including Crime Investigation Agency, Investigation Wing, Dolphin and Operations Wing have been working in the area for the last two months to trace them after they killed five local residents and injured six others. A mobile phone footage showed the suspects firing indiscriminately on citizens.Shahdara Town SHO Mohammad Raza told Dawn the police took two months to trace and arrest the two robbers as the local residents were so terrified that they avoided sharing any details of the criminals .
He said that DIG Operations Lahore Ali Nasir Rizvi assigned task to the two other SHOs, including Imran Niazi and Zaka, who were in Shahdara Town for the last two weeks to nab these criminals.
He said Aniqa’s family was preparing for her marriage after Eidul Fitr and she had left her home for shopping along with her father on the day when she was murdered by the gangsters. Her father was also shot at and critically injured by the same robbers while offering resistance.
The police record of the killed robbers showed they were behind every major heinous criminal activity in Shahdara Town, the SHO said.
“We deployed six female constables in plain clothes for census survey just to get information about the two criminals, installed many safe city cameras in Ittehad and Siraj parks”, the SHO said, adding that the suspects used to leave house separately in the night to commit crime.Another police official said the killing two innocent citizens and the murder of  two suspects in a police encounter have brought the high crime rate of Shahdara Town in the limelight.
It was one of the 85 police stations of the provincial capital Lahore where crime against property was more than even a few small districts of the province.
He said a police constable was also among those  murdered by these two gangsters beside other citizens, he said. They had also shot at and injured another constable Mahmood Ali.
The IGP held a meeting with the police officers including the three SHOs and acknowledged their services in eliminating the  gang from the Shahdara Town area.

“Constitutional positions should be opened to the minorities instead of just assuring them (religious and economic) protections,” Mr Sahotra told a reception here on Friday.
The deputy speaker said that the minorities should have to become part of constitutional bodies like the National Assembly, Senate, and provincial assemblies to get their rights and respect in the country.
He said that becoming a minister in a cabinet is not a new thing for a non-Muslim but claiming a constitutional office of the deputy speaker is the political elevation of an ordinary non-Muslim worker.
“It is the first instance in the last 75 years that a non-Muslim occupies this constitutional office in the country. It is a breath of fresh air in the present atmosphere of political suffocation and disappointment as minority youth are very much worried about their political and economic conditions.”
The deputy speaker said that there is a large population of Christians in Punjab, and they will have to intensify their political struggle for achieving their rights.
MNA Naveed Amir Jeeva said that PPP always gives full representation to the downtrodden sections. He recalled that Shehbaz Bhatti was made federal minister in the past, 5% quota in government jobs and four seats were reserved for minorities in the Senate by the efforts of the PPP.
Aslam Gill said that the country would progress only when all the citizens were provided with equal opportunities.
Additional Secretary General Ali Badar said that it’s a matter of joy to see an ordinary worker become deputy speaker of the Sindh Assembly. He said that encouragement for workers like Anthony Naveed and Amir Jeeva has made other ordinary party workers proud.
Pastor Moazzam, Pitras Sahotra, Khalid Gil, Imran Pal, David Sindhu, Jehangir Khokhar and Asim Adnan were also present.

8,"Without setting wheat procurement goals, govt starts gunny bags distribution","LAHORE: One of the most uncertain, difficult and politically risky wheat procurement campaigns starts in Punjab on...","LAHORE: One of the most uncertain, difficult and politically risky wheat procurement campaigns starts in Punjab on Saturday (today) and the provincial food department has asked farmers to start applying for gunny bags through the Bardana App.
According to the department spokesman, applications are being received on the Bardana App, prepared by the Punjab Information Technology Board, and the process will run through for the next four days – till April 17 – and will receive confirmation through the same application after verification by the Land Record Authority.
Distribution of gunny bags will start on April 19, which will be served on a first-come, first-served basis and the purchase would start on April 22. All the arrangements for the purchase of wheat at the district level have been completed and the food department has established 393 wheat purchase centres across the province, the spokesman said and added that purchase would be at a fixed price of Rs3,900 per 40kg, while delivery charges of Rs30 per 100kg will be paid to each farmer in addition to the price of wheat. To protect the small farmer, the eligibility for bardana acquisition has been kept up to six acres.  
According to the policy, flour mills, the private sector and seed companies are also allowed to purchase wheat at fixed rates.
Apart from the official announcement of the beginning of procurement, everything else is uncertain, say farmers across the province. 
“This is the first time that the government has not announced how much it is going to purchase – the most crucial factor in stabilizing the wheat market. No one knows how much it is going to buy. With the final figure uncertain, no one knows at what speed it would buy and how would it stabilise the market,” says Muhammad Tufail – a farmer from Sheikhupura.
Farmer bodies have their estimates about the official purchase. They think that with over two million tonnes of carryover, the government would need only two million if its historical average purchase is something to go by. However, given the financial crunch and cost of keeping wheat, the provincial department has been opposing even two million tonnes quantity, sowing another uncertainty in farmers’ hearts and markets.  
“It is going be an uncertain situation for farmers. The reports that it is going to be a record crop this year only reinforce our fears,” says a farmer leader who does not want to be named because he is engaged with the Food Department, pleading farmers’ case. With record crop size, the tradable surplus would also record and there would be no one to buy this massive quantity. So, a price crash is the only certainty in the market. How much it crashes is not certain and it would largely depend on the official purchase and its pace, he claims.
“In these circumstances, there is yet another certainty, which is farmers’ protest. If the crash remains within a reasonable limit – set by the investment on crop – the farmers may not take to the streets. However, if the gap between both figures expands to cause losses to farmers, the growers may come out and the government start feeling political heat,” he warns.

9,Crackdown on ‘obscene’ commercial theatre,LAHORE: Certain commercial theatres faced a crackdown during Eid days in the province for promoting obscenity or...,"LAHORE: Certain commercial theatres faced a crackdown during Eid days in the province for promoting obscenity or lacking a license to stage plays from the Punjab Council of Arts (PCA) and other related institutions.
The PCA set up a monitoring cell to check obscenity and nudity in dramas performed on Eidul Fitr. Officers from BS-17 to BS-19 were assigned duties in the field across the province. Theatres across Punjab were being monitored, and institutions concerned were immediately informed about violations of SOPs.
Lahore Deputy Commissioner (DC) Rafia Haider took action against theatres based on PCA complaints. The Bari Theatre in Iqbal Town was stopped from presenting a drama because its license expired in 2023. The Model Town assistant commissioner sealed the Sitara theatre in Gujumta Nishtar Colony for showing a drama without a license and censor rehearsal approval. The City theatre in Kasur was also sealed on the orders of Kasur DC Irshad Bhatti for violating SOPs. Also, warnings were issued to dancer Dedar Multani and Masoma at Tamaseel Theatre in Lahore, Afreen Pari and Feroza at Naz theatre in Lahore, Mehak Chudhry at Naina Theatre in Khanewal, and many others over SOP violations.
PCA Executive Director Syed Bilal Haider told Dawn that Eidul Fitr and Eidul Azha are festivals intended for religious duties, social activities, and some entertainment aspects. Stage drama is also considered a source of entertainment for citizens, but immoral activities and obscene acts are unacceptable in any case. 
He said  that for the first time on Eidul Fitr, PCA officers from Grade 17 to 19 were assigned monitoring duties, and the results were highly encouraging as “we received very few complaints about obscenity and nudity”.
He said commercial theatre, performed in various cities of Punjab, has established a strong popularity. “In the past, people used to come with their families to watch commercial theatres,” Mr Haider said. 
“Now, however, the element of obscenity has prevailed, causing the activity to become reserved only for male attendees at festivals. It has become a theatre that men come to see, but the artists working in it are women whose audacity only adds to their fame and remuneration. In this race, every actress or dancer wants to outdo each other.”
Mr Haider said that with the implementation of the Punjab Theatrical Performance Ordinance of 2023, obscenity and nudity can be controlled. Commercial theatres will be able to create quality content like in the past, content that is creatively strong as well as financially strong. This will attract the attention of audiences for a long time and promote a positive social atmosphere for entertainment.

The video clip of the ‘killing’ was sent to his family and the police from the mobile phone of the alleged victim one and a half months ago.
Initially clueless about the whereabouts of ‘deceased’ Asim Jamshaid, police later, with the help of cellular data and other techniques, found that the man killed in the video was alive. He was found to be betraying the police to implicate former PML-N MPA Ramzan Siddique Bhatti of Lahore in a kidnap and murder case.  
Jamshaid was wanted by Lahore police in a fraud involving millions of rupees from the petrol pump of MPA Bhatti.
The police initiated legal proceedings against him for misleading the police force and attempting to implicate a man in a fake murder case.
MURDER: A man shot dead a woman for allegedly marrying another man on Friday at village Burjrun Singh in the jurisdiction of the Chunian police station.
According to police, Kashif had an affair with Kubra Bibi, of the same village, but parents from both sides were not in agreement. Later, Kubra was married to another man, some months back.
On Friday, when Kubra came to the house of her father, Kashif forced his entry into their house and shot Kubra dead. Later, to end his life, Kashif shot himself in the head.  
The injured was rushed to DHQ Hospital from where he was referred to Lahore General Hospital.  
Police handed over the body of Kubra to the bereaved family and started investigations.
HELD: The Changa Manga police arrested four people for allegedly harassing a family and beating them at Changa Manga recreational park on Wednesday.
A family from Lahore, according to police, went to the recreational park on the day of Eid where some people, due to the security lapse, started teasing the women. When male members prevented them, the suspects beat them. They also beat women when they intervened.  
Meanwhile, someone informed the police that rushed to the spot but only to be attacked and, later, the suspects fled.
The family, however, soon left the park but the police initiated investigations on their own when the news of the incident went viral on social media. Police arrested four suspects but denied that the vagabonds attacked the police party.  
Police said there was no complainant of the incident as the family left the park without submitting any application.
