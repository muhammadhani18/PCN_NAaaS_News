0,Nine arrested for $20m Canada gold heist,Police said the “Netflix-series”-style heist was executed by a “well-organised group of criminals”.,"Canadian police have made arrests and issued nine warrants in the largest gold theft in the country’s history, the BBC reported on Wednesday.
More than 6,500 gold bars worth C$20m (£11.6m), were stolen from Toronto Pearson Airport, in April 2023, along with millions in cash.
According to the report, the alleged driver was arrested in the US carrying dozens of guns that police say were intended for use in Canada.
Police said the “Netflix-series”-style heist was executed by a “well-organised group of criminals”.
The announcement on Wednesday by the Canadian Peel Regional Police and the US Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau came exactly one year after the massive gold heist, reportedly the sixth largest in the world.
The year-long joint investigation was code-named Project 24K. It has included dozens of search warrants and interviews.
So far, police have recovered C$90,000 of “pure gold”, fashioned into six “crudely made” bracelets. They also seized smelting pots, casts and moulds, as well as C$430,000 in cash that police were the profits of gold sales.
In September, Pennsylvania police arrested an Ontario man illegally in the US, who they allege to be the gang’s driver, police said.
The man, named by police as Durante King-McClean, 25, was stopped in Philadelphia for a traffic violation, and firearms were discovered in his car.
“One of those firearms had an obliterated serial number, 11 of them were stolen, and two of them were converted into fully automatic machine guns,” said Eric Degree, a special agent of the ATF in Philadelphia.
According to police, those guns were “intended for import into Canada”. “This isn’t just about a gold heist, this is about how gold becomes guns,” said Nando Iannicca, chair of the Peel Police Services Board.

Afghanistan was parched by an unusually dry winter which desiccated the earth, exacerbating flash-flooding caused by spring downpours in most provinces.
Disaster management spokesman Janan Sayeq said  “approximately 70 people lost their lives” as a result of rains between Saturday and Wednesday.
Fifty-six others have been injured, he said, while more than 2,600 houses have been damaged or destroyed and 95,000 acres of farmland wiped away.
Giving a smaller death toll last week, Sayeq said most fatalities at that point had been caused by roof collapses resulting from the deluges.The United Nations last year warned that  “Afghanistan is experiencing major swings in extreme weather conditions”.
After four decades of war the country ranks among the nations least prepared to face extreme weather events, which scientists say are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change.
At least 25 people were killed in a landslide after massive snowfall in eastern Afghanistan in February, while around 60 were killed in a three-week spate of precipitation ending in March.

2,TikTok asked about risks of its new version,The move by EU industry chief Thierry Breton under EU tech rules comes two months after he opened an investigation into TikTok.,"BRUSSELS: ByteD­ance’s TikTok has been given 24 hours to provide a risk assessment on its new app TikTok Lite launched this month in France and Spain because of concerns about its potential impact on children and users’ mental health, the European Commission said on Wednesday. 
The move by EU industry chief Thierry Breton under EU tech rules comes two months after he opened an investigation into TikTok over possible breaches of the law. 
TikTok should have done a risk assessment on the new app before launching it in the 27-country EU, the Commission said. 
The Commission pointed to the potential impact of the new “Task and Reward Lite” programme on the protection of minors, as well as on the mental health of users, in particular in relation to the potential stimulation of addictive behaviour. 
TikTok Lite, aimed at users aged 18+, has a “Reward Programme” that allows them to earn points while performing certain tasks on the platform such as watching videos, liking content, following creators or inviting friends to join.

3,Missile barrage on Ukraine city kills 17,"BBC report says 50,000 Russian soldiers have been killed during the conflict","CHERNIGIV/LONDON: Three Russian missiles crashed into Ukraine’s historic city of Chernigiv on Wednesday, killing 17 people, as officials pleaded for more air defence systems from allies.
Pools of blood gathered on the street at the scene of one strike, where rescuers searched for survivors in the rubble and carried away the wounded on stretchers, official images showed.
Buildings and cars across the centre of the northern city were destroyed in the strike.
President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has urged allies to send more missiles to thwart Russian aerial attacks, said Ukraine lacked the weapons it needed to intercept the three missiles that struck Chernigiv.
He said he had spoken to Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg about the strike and asked for  “immediate steps” to bolster Ukraine’s air defences. Resident Olga Samoilenko said how she ducked with her children into the corridor of their apartment building for protection when the first missile exploded.

BBC report says 50,000 Russian soldiers have been killed during the conflict

“Our neighbours were already there. We started shouting for everyone to fall to the floor. They did. There were two more explosions. Then we ran to the parking lot,” the 33-year-old said.
The official death toll grew to 17 during the day, while emergency services said 60 people — including three children — had been wounded. “Search and rescue operations are ongoing,” their statement added.
Zelensky blamed Russia for the Chernigiv attack but also said the West should do more to help defend Ukraine’s skies. “This  would not have happened if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence  equipment and if the world’s determination to resist Russian terror had  been sufficient,” he said.
Russian troop losses
More  than 50,000 Russian military personnel have died during the Ukraine  conflict, the BBC reported Wednesday, citing its own reporters,  independent media group Mediazona and volunteers.
They found that  more than 27,300 Russian soldiers died during the second year of the  war, a 25-per cent increase on the first year.
BBC Russian,  Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022,  using open-source information from official reports and the media, as  well as using satellite images of Russian cemeteries to estimate the  number of new graves.
The figure of more than 50,000 is eight  times higher than the official toll acknowledged by Moscow in September  2022. It does not include deaths of militia in Donetsk and Lugansk in  eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine said in February that it had lost 31,000  soldiers, but that figure is also likely to be significantly lower than  the true toll.
Russian losses spiked in January 2023 as it  launched a large-scale offensive in Donetsk and again months later last  year during the battle for the city of Bakhmut.
Russian President  Vladimir Putin announced a  “special military operation” at dawn on  February 24, 2022, which has since turned into a bloody and attritional  war, isolating Russia from the Western world.

4,Suu Kyi moved from prison to house arrest,"YANGON: Jailed Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been moved from prison to house arrest, a military...","YANGON: Jailed Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been moved from prison to house arrest, a military official said on Wednesday, as the junta announced a heatwave had prompted measures to protect inmates.
The 78-year-old Nobel laureate is serving a 27-year sentence for a host of criminal convictions ranging from corruption to breaching Covid-19 rules.
Suu Kyi has largely been hidden from view since the military detained her as they seized power in a 2021 coup, and she has reportedly suffered health problems.
A military official said Suu Kyi and former president Win Myint had been moved from prison to house arrest. Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said that a spell of hot weather had prompted authorities to take measures to protect vulnerable detainees.
“Not only Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and U Win Myint but also some old prisoners were given necessary care because of very hot weather,” Zaw Min Tun said.
The temperature in capital Naypyidaw, where Suu Kyi is believed to be in custody in a specially constructed compound, is expected to hit 41 C (105.8 F) on Wednesday, with even hotter weather forecast for the coming week.
The junta also announced on Wednesday that 3,300 prisoners would be freed as part of a regular amnesty to mark the country’s new year festival.
Outside Yangon’s Insein Prison, about 200 to 300 relatives and friends waited to greet prisoners as they were taken out of the compound in buses. 
It was not immediately clear how long Suu Kyi would be allowed to remain under house arrest beyond the heatwave, or whether the move represented an official reduction in her sentence.

5,Climate impact set to cut 2050 global GDP by nearly a fifth,"Economic fallout from climate change, the study shows, could increase tens of trillions of dollars per year by 2100.","PARIS: Climate change caused by CO2 emissions already in the atmosphere will shrink global GDP in 2050 by about $38 trillion, or almost a fifth, no matter how aggressively humanity cuts carbon pollution, researchers said on Wednesday.
But slashing greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible remains crucial to avoid even more devastating economic impacts after mid-century, they reported in the journal Nature.
Economic fallout from climate change, the study shows, could increase tens of trillions of dollars per year by 2100 if the planet were to warm significantly beyond two degrees Celsius above mid-19th century levels.
Earth’s average surface temperature has already climbed 1.2C above that benchmark, enough to amplify heatwaves, droughts, flooding and tropical storms made more destructive by rising seas.
Annual investment needed to cap global warming below 2C — the cornerstone goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement — is a small fraction of the damages that would be avoided, the researchers found.
Staying under the 2C threshold  “could limit average regional income loss to 20 percent compared to 60 percent” in a high-emissions scenario, lead author Max Kotz, an expert in complexity science at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), said.
Economists disagree on how much should be spent to avoid climate damages.
Some call for massive investment now, while others argue it would be more cost-effective to wait until societies are richer and technology more advanced.
Poor countries hit hardest
The new research sidesteps this debate, but its eye-watering estimate of economic impacts helps make the case for ambitious near-term action, the authors and other experts said.
“Our calculations are super relevant” to such cost-benefit analyses, said co-author Leonie Wenz, also a researcher at PIK. They could also inform government strategies for adapting to climate impacts, risk assessments for business, and UN-led negotiations over compensation for developing nations that have barely contributed to global warming, she said.
Mostly tropical nations — many with economies already shrinking due to climate damages — will be hit hardest, the study found. “Countries least responsible for climate change are predicted to suffer income loss that is 60 per cent greater than the higher-income countries and 40 percent greater than higher-emission countries,” said senior PIK scientist Anders Levermann. “They are also the ones with the least resources to adapt to its impacts.”
Rich countries will not be spared either: Germany and the United States are forecast to see income shrivel by 11 percent by 2050, and France by 13pc. Projections are based on four decades of economic and climate data from 1,600 regions rather than country-level statistics, making it possible to include damages earlier studies ignored, such as extreme rainfall.
A likely underestimate
The researchers also looked at temperature fluctuations within each year
rather than just averages, as well as the economic impact of extreme weather events beyond the year in which they occurred.

6,Hundreds evacuated after volcano erupts in Indonesia,"The volcano, located on Ruang island about 100 km (62 miles) from the provincial capital Manado, has erupted more than three times since Tuesday.","

MOUNT Ruang spews lava and smoke as seen from Sitaro, North Sulawesi.—AFP

 
JAKARTA: At least 800 people in Indonesia’s North Sulawesi province have been evacuated after multiple eruptions of the area’s Ruang volcano, which for days has spewed lava and ash clouds into the sky, the country’s volcanology agency said on Wednesday.
The volcano, located on Ruang island about 100 km (62 miles) from the provincial capital Manado, has erupted more than three times since Tuesday.
Authorities have raised the alert level to the second highest level following the increased activity, Heruningtyas Desi Purna­masari, an official at Indonesia’s Centre for Volcanology and Geolo­gical Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG), said.
The eruption of Mt. Ruang were triggered by recent earthquakes on the island, with the mountain emitting dangerous and  “explosive hot clouds” as high as 1.8 km (1.1 miles) into the sky, she said.
“We must clear the island because we anticipate there could be more eruptions. No activity is allowed within four kilometres from the crater,” she said.
Footage showed flows of red lava streaming down the mountain, reflected in the waters below, and billowing clouds of grey ash above its crater. Ruang island is home to about 838 residents, most of whom have now been evacuated to the nearest island Tagulandang, said Heruningtyas.
Indonesia straddles the so-called  “Pacific Ring of Fire,” an area of high seismic activity that rests atop multiple tectonic plates.

7,14 soldiers wounded in Hezbollah attack on Israeli base,"BEIRUT: Hezbollah said it attacked an Israeli army base near the border on Wednesday, with the latest in a series of...","BEIRUT: Hezbollah said it attacked an Israeli army base near the border on Wednesday, with the latest in a series of tit-for-tat strikes wounding 14 soldiers, according to Israel’s military.
Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire since October 7, triggering crisis in the Gaza Strip.
But Wednesday’s incident marked the third day in a row that Hezbollah strikes wounded people in Israel, with regional tensions high after Iran launched a direct attack on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a deadly strike on Tehran’s Damascus consulate.
Hours after the strike on Arab al-Aramshe, an Arab-majority village in northern Israel near the border, Israeli forces hit targets in eastern Lebanon, a Hezbollah source said.
According to the source, the strike targeted a warehouse in Iaat, a residential area near Baalbek, and  “lightly” wounded one man. The official National News Agency reported three drone strikes in the area, a Hezbollah stronghold far from the border with Israel.
A photographer said the warehouse that was hit stored vegetables and agricultural produce.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which earlier said 14 soldiers were wounded in the strike on northern Israel, including six seriously.
Hezbollah said it launched  “a combined attack with guided missiles and explosive drones on a new military reconnaissance command centre in Arab al-Aramshe”.
According to the Israeli army,  “a number of launches from Lebanon were identified crossing into the area of Arab al-Aramshe,” and Israeli forces struck the sources of the fire.
Hezbollah said the attack came  “in response to the enemy assassinating a number of resistance fighters in Ain Baal and Shehabiya” on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Israel said its strikes in south Lebanon killed two local Hezbollah commanders and another operative, with the Iran-backed group saying three of its members were killed as it launched rockets in retaliation.
Local Israeli authorities said three people were wounded in a strike from Lebanon earlier that day.

The list has highlighted the “influential people” under six categories: leaders, pioneers, artists, icons, innovators and titans.
Israel’s military campaign has killed at least 33,899 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the besieged territory.
Meanwhile, at least 97 journalists and media workers, the majority being Palestinian at 92, have been killed since Israel began its retaliatory attacks on the strip, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reports.
“Journalists in Gaza face particularlyhighrisks as they try to cover the conflict during the Israeli ground assault, including devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, supply shortages and extensive power outages,” the CPJ notes.
Amid all this, Azaiza extensively documented the impact of the fighting, Israeli aggression and wide-scale destruction of Gaza for over 100 days.
The freelance photographer, who was forced onto the frontlines by the horrors of the conflict as most foreign reporters were denied access to Gaza, gained global attention when he recorded himself wearing a press vest and helmet to report on the conditions during the fighting in Israel.

9,Security Council to vote on Palestinian UN membership today,137 of the 193 UN member states already recognise a Palestinian state.,"UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council will vote on Thursday on the Palestinians’ application to become a full UN member state, several diplomatic sources have said.
Amid Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, the Palestinians in early April revived a membership application first made to the world body in 2011, though the veto-wielding United States has repeatedly expressed opposition to the proposal.
The General Assembly can admit a new member state with a two-thirds majority vote, but only after the Security Council gives its recommendation. Regional bloc the Arab Group issued a statement on Tuesday affirming its  “unwavering support” for the Palestinians’ application.
“Membership in the United Nations is a crucial step in the right direction towards a just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question in line with international law and relevant UN resolutions,” the statement said.

137 of the 193 UN member states already recognise a Palestinian state

Algeria, a non-permanent Security Council member, has drafted the resolution that  “recommends” to the General Assembly  “the State of Palestine be admitted to membership of the United Nations.” The vote on Thursday will coincide with a Security Council meeting scheduled several weeks ago to discuss the situation in Gaza, which ministers from several Arab countries are expected to attend. The Palestinians — who have had observer status at the United Nations since 2012 — have lobbied for years to gain full membership.
“We are seeking admission. That is our natural and legal right,” Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, said in April.
According to the Palestinian side, 137 of the 193 UN member states already recognise a Palestinian state, raising hope that their request would be supported in the General Assembly. But the Palestinian push for UN membership faces a major hurdle, as the United States — Israel’s closest ally — could use its veto power to block the Security Council recommendation.
“We call on all members of the Security Council to vote in favor of the draft resolution... At the very least, we implore Council members not to obstruct this critical initiative,” the Arab Group said on Tuesday.
The United States has voiced its opposition to full Palestinian membership, saying it backed statehood but only after negotiations with Israel, while pointing to US laws that would require cuts to UN funding if such a move took place without a bilateral agreement.
“That is something that should be done through direct negotiations through the parties, something we are pursuing at this time, and not at the United Nations,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters in April.
Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan has strongly opposed the Palestinian membership bid, saying in mid-April the considerations were  “already a victory for genocidal terror.”  “The Security Council is deliberating granting the perpetrators and supporters of October 7 full membership status in the UN,” Erdan said.
