KARACHI: Pakistan will look to consolidate their position in the ICC Women’s Championship table to earn direct qualification for next year’s World Cup, when they take on the West Indies in the first of the three-match One-day International series here at the National Bank Stadium on Thursday.
Led by Nida Dar, Pakistan are placed fifth in the table, with eight wins out of a total of 18 matches and will have to finish on the sixth position at the lowest to ensure they don’t need to play the qualifying tournament to make it to the World Cup, set to be held in India.
West Indies, meanwhile, have managed only six wins in 12 matches of the Women’s Championship campaign and will be desperate to improve their record and their prospects to qualifier for the 50-over showpiece.
“Currently, we are at number five in the points table, and God willing, we’ll make every effort to win these matches against West Indies and earn those points to ensure direct entry [into the World Cup],” Nida said during the pre-series press conference on Wednesday.
Pakistan go into the West Indies series, of which the second and third matches will be played at the iconic Karachi venue on Saturday and Tuesday, with a historic win against New Zealand away from home, which would boost their confidence.
Their T20 series win over South Africa here last year, also makes the metropolis a happy hunting ground for Pakistan.
“Well, we are very excited about this series because our records in Karachi are very good,” noted Nida. “We played and won some great matches against South Africa last time. Definitely, the momentum we gained in New Zealand will also count. 
“We know we can beat good teams, and our preparation has been terrific.”
Nida was confident the resources she has at her disposal would be enough for Pakistan to put up a good show against the West Indies. She was especially in awe of all-rounder Fatima Sana, hailing her all-round abilities.
“Our spinners and especially Fatima, have very good records,” said the Pakistan skipper. “Fatima has excellent records in ODIs, and she’s also been the ICC Emerging Player of the Year. 
“Our spin attack has been strong from the start, while our fast bowlers are doing a great job as well.”
West Indies captain Hailey Matthews believed the team needed to improve their show with the bat, as they languished at the ninth place in the Women’s Cham­pionship table.
“I think it’s been evident in our past year two that we probably haven’t scored as many runs as we would have wanted to,” she said. “But at the same time, it’s something that we’ve been working on a whole lot throughout our regional competition and throughout training camps as well. 
“I think when we look at the teams we faced in the championship as well, we’ve had a lot of the higher-ranked teams to play against. 
So hoping that we can go out there and really put up some good performances and, yeah, I guess be able to gain some points off of the teams that are more closely right to us.”

1,US forecast to top medals table for fourth straight Olympics,"China, the last country apart from the US to top the medal table, will retain second place with 35 gold medals.","SYDNEY: The United States will top the medals table for the fourth straight Summer Games in Paris, while France will get a major host-nation bump from eighth to third, according to a forecast 100 days out from the opening ceremony.
The Gracenote virtual medals table, which is compiled using results data from key global and continental competitions since the Tokyo Olympics, has the US on top both on gold medal count (39) and total medal count (123).
The US will host the next Olym­pi­cs after Paris in Los Angeles in 2028.
France is predicted to win 28 gold medals and 55 in total, a jump of 18 golds and 22 medals from its performance in Tokyo three years ago, and will replace the host nation of that Games, Japan, in third place on the table.
China, the last country apart from the US to top the medal table, will retain second place with 35 gold medals, while Britain, Australia and Japan will win the fourth highest number of gold medals with 13 apiece, Gracenote predicts.
The Russian Olympic Com­mittee team were fifth on the Tokyo medals table but only a few Russians and Belarusians will compete in Paris as neutral athletes because of sanctions put in place after the invasion of Ukraine.
“Almost all Russian and Belar­usian competitors have been abs­ent from international competitions since February 2022,” Grac­enote, the content solutions unit of Nielsen, said in a news release.
“Any who take part in Paris 2024 without results in this period cannot be predicted accurately. However, it appears that there will be limited participation of these athletes and we expect the medal table to be the usual accurate reflection.”
Ukraine, whose athletes have struggled to prepare for the Games because of the continuing conflict at home, are forecast to win three golds and 13 total medals in Paris.
At the bottom of the table, Tajik­istan, Finland, San Marino, Trinidad & Tobago, North Korea, Fiji, Panama and Vietnam are all forecast to win a single bronze medal.

2,"Eyeing T20 World Cup, Pakistan look to overwhelm depleted New Zealand",Babar says that the players are trying to improve on weak areas.,"RAWALPINDI: While declaring that Pakistan are targeting this year’s T20 World Cup on the eve of the home series against New Zealand, reappointed captain Babar Azam on Wednesday said currently no player is a sure selection for the global event.
“All the players in our system have emerged on the basis of their performance. The New Zealand [T20] series is a step towards the World Cup [preparations] for which we have made our mindset. And we are going to play [all] the coming series while keeping the primary focus on the World Cup,” Babar told reporters during a pre-match news conference at the Pindi Cricket Stadium.
Pakistan face a second-string New Zealand side, led by Michael Bracewell, in the first of a five-match T20 series in Rawalpindi on Thursday. After the New Zealand series, Pakistan are scheduled to undertake T20 tours to Ireland (May 10-14) and England (May 22-30) before Babar and his men launch the all-important campaign of the World Cup being held in the US and the Caribbean in June.
Answering a question regarding the familiar problem of meeting a certain run-rate at crucial stages which Pakistan have faced in recent World Cups, Babar said that the players are trying to improve on weak areas.
“We have 12 T20 Internationals lined up [including four against England and three against Ireland] before the World Cup. After the Pakistan Super League [held in February-March] we had a break and then regathered for a fitness camp in Kakul. While trying to identify our lackings, we are learning from our mistakes something which we will implement in the World Cup,” the 29-year-old Babar, who was re-installed as Pakistan’s white-ball captain last month by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), said.
On whether the World Cup squad will be composed of the players picked for the New Zealand series or otherwise, Babar was very much explicit in saying that the places for the June 1-29 global event are still up for grabs but at the same time also sounded unsure on the subject.
“There is sometime before the World Cup squad is announced, even after the squad is named there will be time to make [final] changes. Though the team [composition] will be more or less remain same, but you never know. [Currently] no player is 100 percent sure of his selection. For the World Cup, the best players will be selected,” a tentative-looking Babar said.
Replying to a question on his batting position, Babar who will play his first game for Pakistan after being re-installed as skipper, said that the team set-up is being kept “flexible”.
“We are keeping things flexible, and will be using different team combinations in the lead-up to the World Cup in batting as well as bowling. Youngsters will get [appropriate] chances to show their mettle,” he said.
“The [team combination-related] things will be clearer for us in the Ireland and England series.”
Replying to a query on Pakistan’s batting fragility particularly in the middle and late order, Babar said that the present squad has the players, both junior as well as senior, to deliver.
“We have inducted [uncapped batters] Usman Khan and Irfan Khan Niazi both of whom did well in the last PSL. Then we have Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan and Shadab Khan plus [returning all-rounder] Imad Wasim, all of them strengthen our batting,” he said.
“I always hope all my players to perform. And we, the senior players, back the junior ones to deliver.”
A controversy emerged following the out-of-the-blue removal of T20 captain Shaheen Shah Afridi who was replaced with Babar after just one series, which Pakistan lost 4-1 in January. 
Responding to a question on his bonding with Shaheen, Babar said that his relationship with the left-arm pacer was as strong as ever.
“Whatever information I receive [on this subject] comes from you [media]. On my part, I would say that there is nothing wrong in our relationship which is very old. We all support each other in the team,” Babar stated.
“The only aim for all of us is to deliver our best for Pakistan’s victory. In our team, no one thinks individually, all players are positive and work towards the team’s goals.”
‘INTERESTING CHALLENGE’
Meanwhile, stand-in captain Bracewell said playing in Pakistan conditions is a challenge for his side which is missing several key players for the series against Babar and company for different reasons. 
First-choice New Zealand players including Trent Boult, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner and Kane Williamson are presently engaged in the Indian Premier League. Will Young is pursuing an overseas deal with Nottinghamshire, Tom Latham is awaiting the birth of his second child while Tim Southee is currently resting.
“Yes, I think that’s an interesting challenge of international cricket. You get to different places around the world and you’ve got to be quick to adjust to the new conditions and I think that will be a great challenge for us as coming in here and getting our feet on the ground pretty quickly and getting used to the conditions here in Pakistan,” Bracewell told reporters during his presser on Wednesday. 
“But yes it has to be enough time we’ve got to go out and play an international game tomorrow so we’ll be ready to go come 7:30 tomorrow.”
“It’s obviously a huge challenge coming up against a full-strength Pakistan side. They’re a great T20 side and they showed that in the [T20] World Cup last time so I think the there was a few guys missing from this series when New Zealand played Pakistan this time last year and I think that that series showed that we can compete against these guys.
“Two-all was a pretty fair result in the end. Therefore, I think as a group we’re expecting to come here and play some really good cricket and we expect Pakistan to do the same. so yeah hopefully there’s no washouts this time and we can see a winner.
On the Pindi Cricket Stadium which will host the opener today, Bracewell said, “It’s obviously a great place to play cricket and it looks like it’s going to be a good wicket out there as well.”
Squads:
PAKISTAN: Babar Azam (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohmmad Amir, Mohammad Irfan Khan Niazi, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usama Mir, Usman Khan, Zaman Khan
NEW ZEALAND: Michael Bracewell (captain), Tom Blundell, Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Jacob Duffy, Dean Foxcroft, Ben Lister, Cole McConchie, Jimmy Neesham, Will O’Rourke, Tim Robinson, Ben Sears, Tim Seifert, Ish Sodhi, Zak Foulkes.

3,Powell ‘whispering in Narine’s ears’ for T20 World Cup return,NEW DELHI: West Indies skipper Rovman Powell is trying to convince fellow IPL star Sunil Narine to come out of...,"NEW DELHI: West Indies skipper Rovman Powell is trying to convince fellow IPL star Sunil Narine to come out of international retirement for their home T20 World Cup.
All-rounder Narine smashed his first T20 century on Tuesday and took two wickets for Kolkata Knight Riders as they went down to Rajasthan Royals.
The 35-year-old announced his international retirement in 2023, four years after he last played a T20 for the West Indies.
But with the World Cup in June hosted by the West Indies, together with the United States, Powell hopes his countryman will have a change of heart.
“For the last 12 months I’ve been whispering in his ears, he’s blocked out everyone,” Powell, who plays for Rajasthan, said. Powell hopes that Kieron Pollard, Dwayne Bravo and Nicholas Pooran, fellow West Indi­ans in the IPL, “can crack his code”.
Pollard and Bravo are coaches while Pooran plays for Lucknow and is a key member of the West Indies team. Narine, usually a middle or lower-order left-han­ded batsman, was promoted to open the Kolkata innings this season.
He has responded with 276 runs including 109 off 56 deliveries at Eden Gardens stadium on Tuesday. Narine has also claimed seven wickets at an economy rate of 6.87 in a season where big scores have come in abundance.
Narine said earlier this season that he would watch the World Cup “from home”. But he gave a cryptic response when asked about his return to the West Indies team after his ton. 
“It is what it is — we’ll have to see what the future holds,” said Narine, who has played 51 T20 internationals stretching back to 2012.

4,Giant-killers Atalanta ready to deal fatal blow to Liverpool,Atalanta once again punched way above their weight last week by dishing out a 3-0 hammering to Liverpool.,"MILAN: Atalanta have a chance to make history on Thursday as they welcome Liverpool to Bergamo with one foot in the Europa League semi-finals thanks to a stunning first-leg win at Anfield.  
Atalanta once again punched way above their weight last week by dishing out a 3-0 hammering to Liverpool and are on the verge of reaching the last four of a European competition for the first time since 1988.  
Back then Atalanta were a Serie B team and knocked out of the Cup Winners’ Cup by Belgian outfit Mechelen, but nowadays the Italians are competing with and beating an altogether higher class of opposition.  
Last week’s win in England was probably the greatest European night in Atalanta’s history as their run to 2020 Champions League quarter-finals — where they were desperately unlucky to lose to Paris Saint-Germain — came at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic which devastated Bergamo.  
It was also unexpected as Atalanta’s recent form has been patchy with three wins in 11 matches, and manager Gian Piero Gasperini said on Wednesday that the return game at home against Liverpool is still probably the most important match in their history.  
“We are happy to play a match of this value in front of our fans, finally with the stadium taking shape,” Gasperini told a press conference. “We know that it will be one of the most important games in our history, if not the most important, but these are things that are said on the eve of the game, then comes the moment when we will have to know how to isolate ourselves.”  
Gasperini does not want his players resting on their laurels and thinking that the work is already done when they face Juergen Klopp’s side.  
“We know the difficulty, for us they are still the same team, despite us winning the first leg,” he said. “Tomorrow we start from 0-0, our ability will have to be not thinking about the result of the first leg. I expect the best Liverpool possible, with a team that will come here to play all its chances, we will have to play a great game to get a result.”  
Liverpool have won just three of their last eight games in all competitions and are showing clear signs of fatigue after already having played 51 games this season.  
Jurgen Klopp was headed for a glorious send-off in his final season at Liverpool just a few weeks ago, but talk of a potential quadruple is now long forgotten as the Reds have come off the rails.  
Klopp’s men were dumped out the FA Cup by Manchester United last month as the Red Devils edged a thrilling tie 4-3 at Old Trafford.  
Liverpool failed to learn their lesson from that defeat as they were held 2-2 by United three weeks later and then stunned 1-0 at home by Crystal Palace in their last two Premier League games to fall two points behind Manchester City in the title race and now have a mountain to climb if they are to make the Europa League semi-finals.  
The winners of the tie face either Benfica or Olympique de Marseille in the semi-finals.  
On the other side of the draw, Liverpool’s Premier League rivals West Ham United face a massive task to overturn their quarter-final first leg defeat by Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen. 
West Ham lost 2-0 away to Leverkusen, who won their first Bundesliga title on Sunday, and manager David Moyes is hoping their celebrations have taken their toll. 
“It’s fantastic they won the league and they should celebrate something like that,” Moyes told a press conference on Wednesday. “Let’s hope that they have had a few of those big German beers.” 
In the other last-eight tie, AS Roma are at home to AC Milan, holding a 1-0 lead from the first leg.

5,"Lahore, Karachi win big on first day; Quetta edge Rawalpindi","LAHORE:  While Lahore and Karachi recorded facile wins against Peshawar and Multan respectively, Quetta edged past...","LAHORE:  While Lahore and Karachi recorded facile wins against Peshawar and Multan respectively, Quetta edged past Rawalpindi on the first day of the National Women’s One-day Tournament at different venues in Faisalabad on Wednesday.
Ayesha Zafar’s unbeaten century failed to avert a seven-wicket defeat for Peshawar at the hands of Lahore at the Bohranwali Cricket Ground.
Chasing a modest 167, Lahore comfortably achieved their target in 31 overs for the loss of only three wickets, with Dua Majid scoring 66 not out of 74 balls with the help of six fours while captain Kaynat Hafeez contributed a 69-ball 61 laced with eight fours.
Earlier, Ayesha made a 94-ball 108 studded with 16 fours and two sixes but lacked support from the other end as Peshawar totalled a modest 166 all out in 32.5 overs.
Ayesha Bilal (four for 33), Anam Amin (three for 30) and Noreen Yaqoob (two for 40) were among the wickets for Lahore.
At the Iqbal Stadium, Karachi defeated Multan by six wickets.
Pursuing a scanty 117, Karachi raced to victory for the loss of four wickets in just 23.1 overs as Omaima Sohail top-scored with 49.
Batting first, Multan had been dismissed for 116 in 36.3 overs. 
Rameen Shamim’s all-round performance helped Quetta beat Rawalpindi by two wickets in a low-scoring affair at the Jawad Sports Complex Ground.
She first took four wickets for 16 runs to help his team bundle out Rawalpindi for 80 in 43 overs and then scored a 76-ball 27 not out to enable before Quetta to achieve a narrow victory with more than 13 overs to spare.
Summarised scores:
Lahore bt Peshawar by seven wickets.
PESHAWAR 166 in 32.5 overs (Ayesha Zafar 108 not out; Ayesha Bilal 4-33, Anam Amin 3-30, Noreen Yaqoob 2-40); LAHORE 169-3 in 31 overs (Dua Majid 66 not out, Kaynat Hafeez 61)
Karachi bt Multan by six wickets.
MULTAN 116 in 36.3 overs (Gull Feroza 44; Syeda Masooma Zahra 2-15, Aimen Anwar 2-20, Syeda Aroob Shah 2-22); KARACHI 117-4, 23.1 overs (Omaima Sohail 49, Huraina Sajjad 21 not out; Noor-ul-Iman 2-35)
Quetta bt Rawalpindi by two wickets.
RAWALPINDI 80 in 43 overs (Maham Anees 25; Rameen Shamim 4-16); QUETTA 84-8 in 36.3 overs (Rameen Shamim 27 not out; Tania Saeed 3-11, Fatima Zahra 2-24).

6,PSG exorcise old ghosts as Mbappe keeps CL dream alive,BARCELONA: Paris St Germ­ain’s emphatic victory over Barcelona keeps alive the French club’s dream of ending ...,"BARCELONA: Paris St Germ­ain’s emphatic victory over Barcelona keeps alive the French club’s dream of ending the Kylian Mbappe era by lifting the Champions League trophy at Wembley in June.   
Their hopes of going all the way in Europe’s elite club competition for the first time hung in the balance after they lost 3-2 at home to Barca in the first leg of their quarter-final last week.   
They had never previously won a Champions League knockout tie after losing the first leg at home, and their prospects of doing so this time appeared slim after they conceded the opening goal on the night when Raphinha turned in Lamine Yamal’s cross in the 12th minute.   
Another disappointing exit threatened for the Qatar-owned club who had gone out in the last 16 in five of the previous seven seasons.   
But they seized the opportunity given to them in Catalonia after Ronald Araujo’s red card for a foul on Bradley Barcola left Barca to play over an hour with 10 men, allowing Luis Enrique’s team to go on and win 4-1 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate.  
PSG were rampant with the extra player, as Ousmane Dembele again stood out against his old team by scoring the equaliser on the night and winning a penalty which Mbappe converted to put PSG ahead in the tie.   
In between, the outstanding Vitinha — who had already scored in the first leg — netted with a brilliant strike from outside the box, and Mbappe made sure of the win late on to spark wild celebrations in the away contingent at Montjuic.   
“It is a magnificent, historic moment for the club. It is not easy to win here, but I was confident. I told the coach we were going to win and qualify,” PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi proudly told broadcaster Canal Plus.   
The final scoreline was identical to that on their last visit to Barcelona in February 2021, when Mbappe hit a hat-trick in the first leg of a last-16 tie they eventually won 5-2 on aggregate.   
But the manner of this victory surely finally exorcises the ghost of their humiliating collapse in Barcelona in 2017, when they won 4-0 at home in the first leg only to lose 6-1 in the return in a stunning implosion.

Seven years ago, Barcelona went into the 88th minute of the second leg needing to score three times and duly did so.   
This time it was PSG who produced the turnaround, and they now have a glorious opportunity to reach a second Champions League final in five seasons.   
“This means a lot,” Dembele told Canal Plus. “We are crossing our fingers that we can get to Wembley.”   
PSG’s reward will be a meeting with another of Dembele’s former sides, Borussia Dortmund, who overcame Atletico Madrid 5-4 on aggregate after winning 4-2 at home Tuesday.   
“It was a great effort. Everyone was exceptional throughout the whole game. I saw that Borussia Dortmund got through and there’s another club I played for,” said Dembele.   
Mbappe, who is set to leave PSG in the summer with Real Madrid as the biggest favourite to sign him, said that helping his hometown club to finally win their first Champions League title is a matter of pride for him.   
The closest PSG have come to winning the Champions League trophy with Mbappe came in the 2020 final loss to Bayern Munich, behind closed doors in Lisbon during the pandemic.   
It really would feel like a waste for them if they do not manage to win it with such a generational talent in their ranks.   
“I have the dream of winning the Champions League for Paris,” Mbappe told reporters. “I’m proud to be at PSG since the first day. It’s not because there are good times and bad times that my pride takes a hit. The pride of playing for this club, of representing the club of the capital of my country, it’s something special for me who grew up there.   
“To experience an evening like this one as a Parisian, it’s great. We have one more step to go bef­ore we reach the final in Wembley, so we need to stay calm.” 
DORTMUND READY FOR REMATCH 
Dortmund, meanwhile, are relishing a re-match with PSG after knocking out Atletico in a thrilling tie to set up a meeting with the French side they played in the group stage. 
The two sides emerged from this season’s ‘group of death’, which also featured Italian giants AC Milan, who made last season’s final four and ambitious Newcastle United. 
Dortmund coach Edin Terzic feels his side, who won the Champions League in 1997, are now better prepared to face the French champions, after the Germans lost away and drew at home in the group stage. 
“Our first game against them wasn’t good. In the second game, we adjusted to them better and were closer to victory. I think we’re a better team today than we were against them in the group stage,” Terzic said following the win over Atletico. 
Midfielder Julian Brandt, who opened the scoring in the first half for Dortmund, could scarcely believe that his side had made it through to the last four after taking a two goal-lead, conceding two goals, and then scoring twice more. 
“It was a crazy game for the fans and for us. A great game for us, for our fans and for all football fans around the world,” he said after receiving his man-of-the-match award. 
“It’s going to be very serious now against Paris. We played well against them at home in the group stage, but not well away. We want to do better now and, of course, reach the final.” 
After Brandt put Dortmund ahead in the 34th minute, Ian Maatsen increased their lead just five minutes later. 
But Atletico pulled one back four minutes into the second half — and thanks to Dortmund defe­nder Mats Hummels, who defl­ected the ball into his own goal. 
The equaliser came in the 64th with Angel Correa, but Niclas Fuellkrug’s brilliant second-half header brought Dortmund level in the tie, just three minutes before Marcel Sabitzer scored the hosts’ decisive fourth goal. 
“We’ve got one goal: Wembley,” said Fuellkrug.

7,Osaka beaten in first round in Rouen on clay return,PARIS: Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka was knocked out of the first round of the WTA event in Rouen on...,"PARIS: Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka was knocked out of the first round of the WTA event in Rouen on Wednesday, losing 6-4, 6-2 to Italian Martina Trevisan.
The former world number one was making her first appearance on clay since the 2022 French Open, when she was knocked out in the opening round and Trevisan reached the last four.
Osaka, 26, returned to action in January after taking a 15-month break from the tour due to maternity leave.
On Saturday, Osaka said she would like to play in the Paris Olympics but might need to go through an appeals process after failing to make a mandatory two appearances for Japan in the Billie Jean King Cup during the current Games cycle.
Osaka’s world ranking has risen from 831 to 192 since her comeback, although she has not gone beyond the quarter-finals in seven tournaments.
In Rouen, Trevisan broke Osaka in the first game only for the former US and Australian Open champion to hit straight back.
Osaka converted just one of eight break chances in the opening set, which a resilient Trevisan won after nudging ahead in the ninth game.
She carried that momentum into the second set and broke a rusty Osaka again in the third and seventh games to claim victory, only her second in nine tour-level matches this year.
Trevisan will play Ukrainian third seed Anhelina Kalinina in the last 16.

8,Nadal comeback ends in Barcelona Open second round,"BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal suffered his first defeat on his return to tennis after injury as he fell 7-5, 6-1 against...","BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal suffered his first defeat on his return to tennis after injury as he fell 7-5, 6-1 against Alex de Minaur on Wednesday in the Barcelona Open second round.
The 22-time Grand Slam title winner, back on court this week after three months on the sidelines, battled well but eventually crumbled against the hard-working world number 11 from Australia.
Nadal, 37, who missed virtually all of the 2023 season, is hoping to compete at the French Open in May where he is the record 14-time champion.
The Spaniard, who has won the Barcelona clay-court title on 12 occasions, had eased past Flavio Cobolli on Tuesday in his first ATP Tour match since January, but said he was not favourite against De Minaur who has now won his last two clashes against the former world number one.
It proved a far tougher challenge and despite showing flashes of his supreme quality on the court named after him, Nadal came up short in what he said he believes is his final appearance at the tournament.
The Australian broke in the first game and tested Nadal with a series of brilliant drop shots which Nadal could not reach.
However Nadal hit back with a break of his own in the sixth game and consolidated with a fizzing backhand for a 4-3 lead.
De Minaur broke to love to take a 6-5 lead as Nadal went wide and sealed the first set when the Spaniard pushed a shot into the net, winning the final 10 points as Nadal started to struggle.
The 25-year-old Australian broke for a 2-1 lead in the second set when Nadal could not return a powerful passing shot, and secured another break for 4-1.
De Minaur wrapped up his emphatic second set performance with a third break when Nadal went long.
Earlier on Wednesday, Norway’s three-time Grand Slam finalist Casper Ruud came out on top in  an entertaining 6-3, 6-4 match with Alexandre Muller to reach the third round. 
The 25-year-old Norwegian, runner up at the Monte Carlo Masters last  week, was broken twice in the first set and allowed Muller to save 10  of 14 break points. 
However, despite his sloppiness Ruud still took the set. 
The third seed looked to have sealed the match when he broke his French journeyman opponent in the third game of the second set. 
However, the world number six gave up four break points while serving for the match to allow 27-year-old Muller back in at 5-4.
Ruud, though, was more clinical in the next game, breaking Muller to  progress with his 25th victory in 2024.
“This year is much better than last year, I’m having a good year,”  said Ruud, who defeated world number one Novak Djokovic last week.
Ruud will now face Jordan Thompson of Australia, who defeated Spain’s Jaume Munar 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, in the next round.
In the day’s other match, Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic also reached the last 16 after defeating Frenchman Ugo Humbert, the No 6 seed, 6-4, 6-4 at Real Club de Tenis Lajovic will now face Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who got a walk over victory against To­mas Machac of the Czech Rep­ublic, in the next round.
