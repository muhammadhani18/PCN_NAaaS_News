0,Faizabad commission report silent on question of ‘responsibility’,"""Theoretical"" report blames Punjab govt for allowing protesters into capital; deplores weak command and communication between security agencies, police.","ISLAMABAD: Although the primary objective of setting up the Faizabad commission was to fix responsibly for the failures that led to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP) 2017 sit-in spiraling out of control, the commission’s report stops short of placing the blame directly on any individual’s shoulders.
Its most damning finding, however, seems to be against the Shehbaz Sharif-led Punjab government, which it says not only failed to prevent protesters from entering the capital, but even prevailed upon then-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi to allow them to hold a demonstration at Faizabad, thinking they would disperse afterwards.
“The government of Punjab remained evasive and weak. Had they acted firmly at the beginning, the situation would not have come to such a pass. Allowing them to proceed to Islamabad was not a proper decision,” the report says, adding that then-Punjab law minister Rana Sanaullah remained conspicuous by his refusal to appear before the commission, or answer any of its questions, either in writing or otherwise.
 
 

As per its terms of reference, the commission was asked to “inquire into any illegal financial and/or other support provided to TLP for the sit-in; recommend action against those who issued edicts or fatwas during or in relation to the Faizabad sit-in… determine violation, if any, of the law and the liability incurred by any person or public office holders, [and] fix responsibility of any person and/or government officers, including those working with intelligence agencies”.

‘Theoretical’ report blames Punjab govt for allowing protesters into capital; deplores weak command and coordination between security agencies, police

However, a review of the commission’s TORs and background conversations with sources privy to the commission’s workings suggest that its report is silent on many questions it was supposed to answer, being described by one insider as being “theoretical” in its nature.
In addition, the report notes a failure to implement aspects of the National Action Plan (NAP), highlights gaps in the capacity of law enforcement agencies and points out deviations from standard operating procedures (SOPs) that led to a lack of coordination between security agencies and the federal and Punjab governments.
According to the report, the federal government gave Inter-Services Intelligence the go-ahead to negotiate with protesters, and assigned the Rangers DG to lead an operation against them. However, the eventual law enforcement action against TLP demonstrators — which went south, resulting in around seven deaths and over 250 casualties to police and FC personnel — was led by the Islamabad inspector general.
This also raises a legal question: under the laws of the land, armed forces are supposed to act “in aid of civil power”. As such, leading any law enforcement operation falls to the civil administration, which consists of the district magistrate, chief commissioner and police chief.
The report notes that Islamabad police launched an operation to disperse protesters in compliance with the directives of the Islamabad High Court, but “failed due to a lack of coordination between Rawalpindi and Islamabad police”, adding that this also indicated the inability of the Rawalpindi administration and police to block reinforcements to the protesters.
“Weak command and control was observed at the senior level,” the report noted, referring to a lack of coordination between police in Punjab and Islamabad, and observed that multiple forces doing the same job within the territorial jurisdiction nullify the concept of unity of command.
“There must be one force, that is police, to deal with issues of law and order and resources spent on others may be diverted to Islamabad police… Rangers and Frontier Constabulary have been raised for patrolling border areas, therefore, their use in urban areas may be avoided,” it observed.

1,Report ‘only blames politicians’,"PTI demands action against Shehbaz Sharif, his cabinet.","ISLAMABAD: Leaders from the two main parties in the ruling coalition have slammed the Faizabad dharna commission’s report, saying that it only places responsibility on politicians, while the PTI termed it a charge sheet against the sitting prime minister.
Reacting to the report, a PTI spokesperson called for action against the then-Punjab government, especially Shehbaz Sharif, who the party said was guilty of dereliction of duty and misconduct in view of the report.
However, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday criticised the report, saying that it had “no authenticity or credibility”.

PTI demands action against Shehbaz Sharif, his cabinet

In an interview with senior journalist Asma Shirazi, the defence minister said that the report had no value and its authors should reflect and ask themselves if they have fulfilled their duty or not. He said the report was not credible because both the main characters in the episode did not appear in front of the commission to answer its questions for the report, an apparent reference to former army chief retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and then-ISI DG (C) retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed.
“Why were these people not presented? Their absence makes this report incomplete,” the minister said, adding that the pair had “all sorts of power” during the period under investigation by the commission.
Separately, former Senate chairman and veteran PPP leader Raza Rabbani called the report “a non-starter”.
“It chose to close the matter while avoiding further controversy and avoided to fix any responsibility, Mr Rabbani noted, adding: “It has tried to shift the burden on the civilian government of Punjab, exonerating the then DGs of Rangers and ISI.”
Meanwhile, the PTI called on the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) to make the Faizabad dharna commission report public and issue orders regarding the execution of the commission’s recommendations in order to bring the culprits to justice.
The party has demanded the apex court to issue orders to register criminal cases against Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet in view of the recommendations of the commission.

2,Intense rainfall expected in Pakistan over next two weeks,"Since Friday, lightning strikes and other storm-rela­ted incidents have claimed over 60 lives nationwide.","QUETTA/GWADAR/ ISLAMABAD: As the latest projections from the National Emergency Ope­rations Centre (NEOC) and multiple weather models suggest that Pakistan is expected to experience a series of moderate to intense weather systems till April 29, a new spell of torrential rain has entered Balochistan, with rain and thunderstorms lashing many districts, including Quet­­ta, since Wednesday morning.
Additionally, the Pakis­tan Me­­­teorological Dep­artment (PMD) has forecasted rain, wi­­ndstorms, thunderstorms, and a few hailstorms across most pla­­ces of Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa (KP), Gilgit-Bal­tistan (GB), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Is­­lamabad, Punjab, Sindh and Ba­­­lochistan in the next 24 hours.
Since Friday, lightning strikes and other storm-rela­ted incidents have claimed over 60 lives nationwide.
According to the forecast, a weather system is poised to en­­ter Pakistan, leading to heavy rainfall and thunderstorms until April 22. Balochistan will experience the impact from April 17 to April 19, followed by Punjab and Sindh from April 18 to April 19. The effects will ex­­tend to upper Punjab from April 18 to April 21, while KP, GB, and AJK will be affected from April 17 to April 22.
Following this, a weaker weather system is expec­ted to enter Pakistan on April 23, bringing low rainfall and thunderstorms to certain parts of the country until April 24. While Balochistan and upper Punjab will experience slight impacts from April 23 to April 24, KP, GB, and AJK will also be affected. However, Sindh is not expected to be impacted during this period.

In light of these projections, the National Disaster Management Authority has issued instructions for provincial and district authorities, and other relevant line departments to remain vigilant and prepared to respond to any emergency situations.
Rain disrupts Balochistan
Meanwhile, many areas in rain-affected districts of Balo­chistan remain cut off from Quetta and district headquarters due to washed-out link roads caused by heavy rains, with large numbers of houses were damaged in southern and northern Balochistan.
Heavy rain breached the rai­lway track at the Quetta-Zahe­dan railway section bet­ween Dalban­din and Nokundi, once again suspending goods train service between Pakistan and Iran. Flash floods in the area also affected the Quetta-Taftan highway, disrupting traffic.
Traffic was suspended bet­w­een Harnai-Sanjavi-Ziarat due to badly damaged inter-district roads, leaving residents stra­n­ded without road access to Qu­­etta or other areas. However, officials stated that concerned departments were working to restore traffic between affec­ted districts using heavy machinery.
The new spell of rains severely affected Gwadar and other areas of the Makran region, disrupting normal life as rainwater entered human settlements. Residents, who had recently returned to their homes after dewatering them following previous heavy rains, were forced to flee to safe places.
Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, head of the Haq Du Tehreek and MPA from Gwadar, visited flood-hit areas, directing local administration to launch immediate rescue and relief work.

3,Imran assails civil authority’s ‘surrender’ in Bahawalnagar,IHC keen to wind up cipher case as soon as possible.,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan took a potshot at the civil administration on Wednesday over the recent Bahawalnagar face-off between the police and army personnel, accusing the former of surrendering to the latter as the IGP Punjab and the “viceroy” — an apparent reference to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — had tendered an apology over the torture of police officials.
Talking to reporters at Ad­­iala jail after a hearing, the PTI fou­nder described the Bahawalnagar incident as a reflection of the “law of jungle” and said the powerful had beaten up police officials and then also sought an apology. The viceroy, he added, acted upon the instruction and called the personnel of both the forces brothers.
“[However] a brother does not deserve such a treatment,” Mr Khan said. He also accused the establishment of being behind the conviction of his spouse, Bushra Bibi.
The ex-PM claimed that since he had named some powerful elements during the last hearing, the jail administration erected a glass wall to contain him.

IHC keen to wind up cipher case as soon as possible

It may be mentioned that the temporary court room at the Community Hall of jail has been restructured and the administration has raised the height of the separating walls to nine feet.
Initially, there was no partition and the hall was divided into three parts. One is reserved for Mr Khan and his legal team, second is for media persons and the third is for the general public.
Cipher hearing
Meanwhile, Islamabad High Cou­rt (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq on Wednesday said that court would decide the appeals against the conviction of Mr Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi in the cipher case as early as possible.
Earlier, an IHC division bench comprising Justice Farooq and Ju­­stice Miangul Hassan Aurang­zeb resumed hearing on the appeals.
Barrister Salman Safdar, counsel for Mr Khan, had concluded his arguments on Tuesday.
FIA’s Special Prosecutor Hamid Ali Shah commenced his arguments on Wednesday.
Justice Farooq instructed him to be brief and avoid repetition.
He remarked, “We want to conclude the case as soon as possible.”
Further hearing in the matter was adjourned to April 23.

4,NAB gives Nawaz clean chit in Toshakhana car case,ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Accountability Bure­­au (NAB) on Wednesday cleared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in...,"ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Accountability Bure­­au (NAB) on Wednesday cleared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the Toshakhana vehicle reference.
The anti-graft watchdog stated this in a report submitted to the accountability court in response to its direction issued in connection with the reference about three luxury vehicles gifted to Pakistan.
According to the reference, President Asif Ali Za­­rdari and PML-N sup­re­­me leader Nawaz Sharif had obtained cars from To­­shakhana by paying only 15 per cent of their price.
“This case may attract any other offence but it has no relevancy with the benefit of Toshakhana as the subject vehicle when purchased was not part of Toshakhana, rather than the same was part of the federal transport pool,” it said.
The report stated that Nawaz Sharif had not made the payment for the vehicle from a fake bank account.
Subsequently, NAB urged the accountability court to acquit or discharge the former prime minister from the reference.

5,PTI refutes Marwat’s claim linking Saudi Arabia with ‘regime change’,Party says remarks ‘not based on facts’; govt spox  calls it ‘heinous attempt’ to derail S. Arabia ties,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has publicly distanced itself from comments made by party leader Sher Afzal Marwat, who accused both the United States and Saudi Arabia of conspiring to topple the PTI government, stirring tensions amid a critical visit from a high-level Saudi delegation to Pakistan.
Party leaders emphasised their respect for Saudi Arabia, dismissing any suggestion of its involvement in the “regime change conspiracy”, a phrase used by the PTI to refer to Imran Khan’s ouster in April 2022. 
Mr Marwat, a member of PTI’s political committee, levelled the allegations in an interview on a private news channel. He also claimed that Saudi Arabia was influenced by the US in regional matters.
His statements have sparked significant unrest, coinciding with the visit of Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud to Pakistan.

Party says remarks ‘not based on facts’; govt spox  calls it ‘heinous attempt’ to derail S. Arabia ties

Mr Marwat later said the remarks were his personal opinion and had nothing to do with the party policy.
The PTI on Wednesday also distanced itself from the statement, claiming that it was not the party’s official position. A party spokesperson said Mr Marwat’s statement did not reflect the party’s stance and was “not based on facts”.
The spokesperson added that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia shared a close and brotherly relationship, highlighted by the warm ties between former prime minister Imran Khan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Asad Qaiser in a post on X (formerly Twitter) said: “Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, united by shared values, culture, and a common vision for regional peace and prosperity. We extend a warm welcome to the high-powered delegation from Saudi Arabia, led by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.”
Another party leader, Zulfikar Bukhari, also took to the social media platform, affirming: “Neither Imran Khan nor PTI holds any such opinion about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. KSA has ALWAYS been and will be our closest brotherly country. They have never failed to help us in any circumstance or situation. Even the most recent visit is a testament to that.”
Mr Marwat also posted a message on X, insisting that his statement about Saudi Arabia was based on his personal views. “I never claimed in my interview that this stance had any official backing of the PTI,” he said.
Govt reaction
Meanwhile, a government spokesperson on Wednesday said the allegations of PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat against Saudi Arabia were a “heinous attempt” to impact the relations between the two brotherly countries.
APP quoted Legal Affairs Spokes­person Barrister Aqeel Malik as saying that the PTI leader gave the statement at a time when a high-level Saudi delegation was visiting the country.
He said the statement was a nefarious conspiracy to interfere with the process of Saudi investment in the country and destabilise the national economy.
The PTI had always tried to spoil relations with friendly countries, he added.

6,"Overbilling by power firms not to be tolerated, warns interior minister","JI demands audit of distribution companies to ascertain true picture of ""overcharging"".","ISLAMABAD: Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday vowed to pursue a zero-tolerance policy on overbilling by power distribution companies across the country. 
In a statement, he made it clear that overbilling would not be tolerated under any circumstances. He said Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) had overbilled consumers in the city and its adjoining areas for 830 million units last year, regretting that Lesco overbilled even the consumers using just 300 units. 
Mr Naqvi instructed the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to take stern action against any official found involved in overbilling.
In addition to combating overbilling, the minister also called for a swift crackdown on power theft, directing FIA officers to demonstrate best performance in tackling overbilling and power theft cases. 

JI demands audit of distribution companies to ascertain true picture of ‘overcharging’

Condemning the overbilling, the minister said it is a grave injustice to the public. He pledged to provide relief to the masses with an assurance that those involved in issuing inflated bills would be brought to justice.
Mr Naqvi highlighted the importance of addressing power theft and said the FIA officers would take action against the corrupt across the country, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to effectively control cases of power theft.
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Naib Emir Liaquat Baloch has called for an audit of power distribution companies to ascertain the true picture of overbilling inflicted on the masses by power companies. 
In a statement, Mr Baloch said the disclosure of overbilling by the interior minister to the tune of 830 million units by Lesco is shocking and warrants an audit of all power distribution companies. 
The Jamaat-i-Islami leader said a more horrible picture wo­uld emerge after the audit exercise.
He said the ever-increasing line losses and free electricity for government servants are some of the key reasons for decline of Wapda and a huge burden on the national exchequer. 
He said that unjust agreements with private power producers in the past were another reason for extremely expensive electricity tariff in the country. 
He said despite repeated hike in power tariff, the circular debt of energy sector is still at an all-time high.

On Wednesday, the Governor House PRO had announced on social media that the ceremony would be held today (Thursday), although the Chief Minister’s Secretariat and Services and General Administration Depart­ment (S&GAD) had issued no official notification in this regard.
But later on Wednesday night, he issued a statement saying that the “ceremony on Thursday has been cancelled”, and did not announce a new date.
Sources say the delay is due to disagreements over the distribution of ministries among the two major parties — PPP and PML-N.
The cabinet’s formation has been delayed by nearly a month and a half due to CM Sarfraz Bugti’s absence, who had been abroad to inquire after his ailing brother.
