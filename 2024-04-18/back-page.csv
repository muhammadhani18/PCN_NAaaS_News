• Western bloc discusses ramping up sanctions at G7 meeting
TEHRAN / JERUSALEM / BRUSSELS: Amid a diplomatic flurry aiming to calm a region already on the edge, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday his country would decide how to respond to Iran.
Tehran, however, said its military and air force were ready to confront any Israeli attack.
Israel faces pressure from its allies to refrain from striking back at Iran.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock were the first Western envoys to visit Israel and urge calm, but Netanyahu told the visiting ministers that Israel “will reserve the right to protect itself,” his office said.
The German FM called for “prudent restraint”, saying the region must not slide into a situation whose outcome is completely unpredictable.
Meanwhile, Mr Cameron said that “we’re very anxious to avoid escalation and to say to our friends in Israel: It’s a time to think with head as well as heart.”
The US has already made clear it won’t join any attack on Iran and has called for de-escalation, as have a host of other Western and Arab leaders.
Israel’s military chief Herzi Halevi has already vowed “a response” to Iran’s first-ever direct attack, while military spokesman Daniel Hagari stressed that Tehran would not get off “scot-free”.
But it remains unclear how and when Israel might strike, and whether it would target Iran directly or attack its interests or allies abroad in places such as Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
A direct attack on Revolutionary Guards bases or nuclear research facilities within Iran is among the options Israel has to strike back.
Iran holds military parade
Meanwhile, Iran celebrated the “success” of its drone and missile strike during its annual military parade on Wednesday, as Hamas termed Tehran’s actions a “legitimate and deserved” response to a strike on the Islamic republic’s consulate in Syria.
In its first reaction, Hamas said, “The response from the Islamic Republic of Iran confirms that the time when the Zionist entity could act as it wanted without accountability or punishment has ended.”
The operation dubbed Honest Promise “brought down the glory of the Zionist regime (Israel)”, President Ebrahim Raisi said at a military base on the outskirts of Tehran.
“This operation showed that our armed forces are ready,” he said in a speech addressed to the regular army and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
“Any attack by the Zionist regime (Israel) on our soil will be dealt with a severe response,” state media quoted him as saying.
In his speech, Raisi also hit out at countries that had “sought to normalise relations” with Israel.
“These countries are now humiliated in front of their own people which constitutes a strategic failure for the regime” of Israel, he added.
Meanwhile, the commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force said at the same event that its warplanes, including Russian-made Sukhoi-24s, were in their “best state of preparedness” to counter any Israeli attack.
Air force commander Hamid Vahedi warned Iran’s enemies against making a “strategic error”.
“We are 100 per cent ready in all aerial fronts,” he was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency.
Wednesday’s parade saw Iranian forces showcase a range of military equipment, including drones and long-range ballistic missiles.
Among them were multiple versions of the Ababil, Arash and Mohajer drones as well as the Dezful medium-range ballistic missile and S-300 air defence missile system.
EU, G7 working on sanctions
Separately, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Brussels was also working to expand sanctions against Iran, including its supply of drones and other weapons to Russia and to proxy groups around the Middle East.
European Union leaders met on Wednesday to discuss stepping up sanctions against Iran to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East, more than six months into Israel’s war in Gaza.
“The EU is ready to take further restrictive measures against Iran, notably in relation to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missiles,” a draft statement said ahead of the summit.
Meanwhile in Italy, foreign ministers from the G7 nations gathered on Wednesday for talks dominated by the crisis in the Middle East. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is among those attending the meeting of the Group of Seven.
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed they were “working” on some kind of sanctions against Iran.

1,Indian polls from Friday to decide future of its democracy,Opposition sees an opening for itself in PM’s northern stronghold; Modi says he is confident of getting more than 400 seats in Lok Sabha.,"

NEW DELHI: India begins its crucial national elections on Friday amid hopes and fears for its troubled democracy.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the most right-wing leader to head the country, is hoping to win a third consecutive term, the first time since Jawaharlal Nehru, while his rejuvenated rivals say he could lose.
Mr Modi says he is confident of getting more than 400 seats in the 18th Lok Sabha, a brute majority of in the 545-seat lower house, a feat achieved only once by Rajiv Gandhi.
The Bharatiya Janata Party hopes to increase its tally from 303 to 370, the rest coming from other members of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). It is widely feared that Mr Modi would seek to use the majority to change the constitution to align with his idea of Hindu Rashtra.

Opposition sees an opening for itself in PM’s northern stronghold; Modi says he is confident of getting more than 400 seats in Lok Sabha

Mr Modi’s hitherto fractious rivals comprising regional parties plus the Congress, recently cobbled the India National Development Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc. They are pitching for the removal of the NDA from power for its “whimsical policies, narcissistic hegemony, communal avowal as well as violence against the minorities and the fear factor against any dissent”.
Ground reports say there is no Modi wave evident in any part of the country, but these are early days. The biggest chunk of seats will be in the fray on Friday, covering 102 races in 21 states. The remaining six phases of the polls, including the last leg on June 1, will make these the longest elections in memory. Security is cited as the reason, and it would involve the deployment of 3.4 lakh paramilitary forces in rotation.
West Bengal, where the Bharatiya Janata Party is hoping to expand from the 18 of 42 seats it won last time, would see polls in all seven phases. A maximum of 92,000 security personnel are likely to be deployed there.
The BJP had just two seats in the state in 2014.
The NDA is banking largely on the so-called Modi magic together with the Ram Mandir and the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Every BJP leader is reinforcing Hindutva, which otherises the Muslims. The BJP’s manifesto is personalised as ‘Modi ki Guarantee’, with the programmes of a decade-long rule listed. The Congress’s promise of ten forms of justice has fresh appeal: “We promise you greater freedom, faster growth, more equitable development and justice for all.”
The rub however is in the numbers. Mr Modi’s 39 per cent votes got him 55 per cent seats in 2019. In so doing, he obviously won by dividing the 61 per cent votes cast for non-BJP parties.
The opposition sees in this a chance, which requires it to unite where it matters. The question is where would Mr Modi find the extra 67 opposition seats while not losing any of his to account for the BJP’s goal of hitting 370 without allies.
The opposition sees an opening for itself in Mr Modi’s northern stronghold. Much has changed since 2019 when he won all seven seats in Delhi, all 10 in Haryana, all 25 in Rajasthan, 25 of 48 in Maharashtra, 27 of 29 in Madhya Pradesh, all 26 in Gujarat, 62 of 80 in Uttar Pradesh, 22 of 40 in Bihar, all five in Uttarakhand and all four in Himachal Pradesh.
That adds up to 213 seats for the BJP from the northern stronghold. Elsewhere, the BJP picked up 25 out of 28 in Karnataka, eight of 21 in Odisha and four from 17 in Telangana. The BJP won two seats from 25 in Andhra Pradesh. It’s saturated in the north and in the absence of a divisive issue clicking, the chances are it could only go down from there.
In Karnataka, Telangana and Himachal Pradesh the Congress has taken power since the last elections. The BJP might improve its tally in Andhra Pradesh where it has cobbled an alliance with the Telugu Desam. Wild guesses have been made, however. Rahul Gandhi says the Modi alliance could be restricted to 180, nearly a hundred short of a majority.
Shiv Sena’s Uadhav Thackeray on whose strength the BJP won handsomely in Maharashtra feels, not without a tinge of bitterness that the BJP would get just 45 seats. And the Trinamool Congress of West Bengal says it would get twice the number of seats than the BJP in the state, which should worry Mr Modi’s supporters.
After the Muzaffarnagar communal polarisation of 2014 and Pulwama-Balakot nationalist fervour fuelled his campaign in 2019, the Modi souffle has so far failed to rise again.

2,Another mass grave found in Gaza hospital,"A fresh mass grave was found in Gaza Strip’s Al-Shifa Hospital this week, according to Al Jazeera. The grave was found after some","A fresh mass grave was found in Gaza Strip’s Al-Shifa Hospital this week, according to Al Jazeera.
The grave was found after some employees informed relief and rescue workers that an unspecified number of bodies were dumped in the hospital’s premises over the past few months because the incessant bombardment by Israel had made it almost impossible to ensure a normal burial.
The channel’s correspondent quoted an employee of the hospital as saying he was confident that another mass grave would be found at Beit Lahiya, a town near Gaza City which bore the brunt of Israeli bombing soon after the crisis unfolded on Oct 7.
According to the channel’s correspondent, Palestinian families have been visiting the hospital to find out whether the grave contains the bodies of their loved ones. Walid Radwa Ftima was one of them. He said he was able to identify the body of his mother thanks to a distinctive mark on her leg.
Israel’s onslaught in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas’ raid inside the Jewish state on Oct 7, which by its tallies killed 1,200 with 253 taken prisoner.
The subsequent bombardment has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, displaced the majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and caused a grave humanitarian crisis.
Israel has faced growing global opposition to the relentless bombardment of Gaza, which the United Nations and aid agencies have warned has pushed the north of the territory to the brink of famine. But Netanyahu rejected any claims about famine on Wednesday, saying Israel is doing “above and beyond” what is needed “on the humanitarian issue”.

3,Body to probe allegations against former spymaster,Inquiry committee will prepare its report in light of its findings and present it to relevant authorities.,"ISLAMABAD: The military has reportedly formed an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of misuse of authority against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hamid.
Media reports aired on Wednesday said the committee had been formed by the military as a gesture of self-accountability and will be headed by a serving major general.
They said the committee was formed in the light of directives of the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Defence.
The management of Top City, a private housing scheme, had levelled grave allegations against the former ISI chief, claiming that he had orchestrated a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.
In Nov last year, the Supreme Court had asked the owner of the housing society to approach the relevant quarters, including the defence ministry, for the redressal of his grievances against the former spymaster and his aides.
The newly constituted inquiry committee will prepare its report in the light of its findings and present it to the relevant authorities, reports said.

4,Judge warns Trump against intimidating jurors,Seven panelists picked in historic criminal hush money trial.,"NEW YORK: The judge in Donald Trump’s historic criminal trial has warned the Republican presidential hopeful against intimidating jurors as seven panelists were chosen with unexpected speed following questioning by both sides.
There had been speculation that jury selection could take weeks in such a high-profile and sensitive case — the first criminal trial of a former US president, who also is running to return to the White House this November.
But Judge Juan Merchan ended the session on Tuesday, saying he was hopeful opening arguments could begin as early as on Monday next week.
After a preliminary phase in Trump’s trial in which prospective jurors could opt out if they felt unable to be impartial or had extenuating circumstances, defence attorneys and prosecutors began questioning the candidates in depth.

Seven panelists picked in historic criminal hush money trial

Twelve jurors in total are needed, and six alternates will also be chosen.
For Trump to be convicted of his alleged fraud in a scheme to cover up an embarrassing alleged extramarital encounter with a porn star, the jury must render a unanimous verdict. Even one dissenting voice would see him walk free.
Merchan cautioned Trump at one point that his muttering was audible to one juror who faced scrutiny over social media posts. “I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom,” Merchan said.
Trump, 77, has been ordered by Merchan to be in court daily, putting a major hitch in his campaign plans.
“I should be right now in Pennsylvania and Florida — in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia — campaigning,” Trump said in angry remarks outside the court. He called Merchan “Trump-hating”.
Meanwhile, President Joe Biden spent the day touting his economic policies in a visit to his birthplace in Scranton, Pennsylvania — a key swing state he narrowly carried in the 2020 election.
Merchan has warned Trump against repeating his frequent past attempts to turn hearings into impromptu campaign appearances with outbursts at witnesses and staff, as well as tirades on social media.
The judge has already scheduled a hearing next week to consider whether Trump should be held in contempt for violating a partial gag order restricting him from attacking individuals connected to the case.

5,Did cloud seeding cause powerful Gulf storm?,Experts say global warming leading to ‘extraordinarily’ warm water in seas around Dubai.,"DUBAI: A storm hit the United Arab Emirates and Oman this week bringing record rainfall that flooded highways, inundated houses, grid-locked traffic and trapped people in their homes.
At least 20 people were reported to have died in the deluge in Oman while another person was said to have died in floods in the UAE that closed government offices and schools for days.
The storm had initially hit Oman on Sunday before it pounded the UAE on Tuesday, knocking out power and causing huge disruptions to flights as runways were turned into rivers.
In the UAE, a record 254 millimetres (10 inches) of rainfall was recorded in Al Ain, a city bordering Oman. It was the largest ever in a 24-hour period since records started in 1949.

Experts say global warming leading to ‘extraordinarily’ warm water in seas around Dubai

Cloud seeding?
Rainfall is rare in the UAE and elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula, that is typically known for its dry desert climate. Summer air temperatures can soar above 50 degrees Celsius.
But the UAE and Oman also lack drainage systems to cope with heavy rains and submerged roads are not uncommon during rainfall.
Following Tuesday’s events, questions were raised whether cloud seeding, a process that the UAE frequently conducts, could have caused the heavy rains.
Cloud seeding is a process in which chemicals are implanted into clouds to increase rainfall in an environment where water scarcity is a concern.
The UAE, located in one of the hottest and driest regions on earth, has been leading the effort to seed clouds and increase precipitation.
But the UAE’s meteorology agency told Reuters there were no such operations before the storm.
Climate change
The huge rainfall was instead likely due to a normal weather system that was exacerbated by climate change, experts say.
A low pressure system in the upper atmosphere, coupled with low pressure at the surface had acted like a pressure ‘squeeze’ on the air, according to Esraa Alnaqbi, a senior forecaster at the UAE government’s National Centre of Meteorology.
That squeeze, intensified by the contrast between warmer temperatures at ground level and colder temperatures higher up, created the conditions for the powerful thunderstorm, she said.
The “abnormal phenomenon” was not unexpected in April as when the season changes the pressure changes rapidly, she said, adding that climate change also likely contributed to the storm.
Climate scientists say that rising global temperatures, caused by human-led climate change, is leading to more extreme weather events around the world, including intense rainfall.
“Rainfall from thunderstorms, like the ones seen in UAE in recent days, sees a particular strong increase with warming. This is because convection, which is the strong updraft in thunderstorms, strengthens in a warmer world,” said Dim Coumou, a professor in climate extremes at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
‘Can’t create clouds from nothing’
Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said rainfall was becoming much heavier around the world as the climate warms because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. It was misleading to talk about cloud seeding as the cause of the heavy rainfall, she said.
“Cloud seeding cant create clouds from nothing. It encourages water that is already in the sky to condense faster and drop water in certain places. So first, you need moisture. Without it, there’d be no clouds,” she said.
Global warming has resulted in “extraordinarily” warm water in the seas around Dubai, where there is also very warm air above, said Mark Howden, Director at the Australian National University’s Institute for Climate, Energy & Disaster Solutions.
“This increases both potential evaporation rates and the capacity of the atmosphere to hold that water, allowing bigger dumps of rainfall such as what we have just seen in Dubai.” Gabi Hegerl, a climatologist at Edinburgh University, said that extreme rainfall, like in the UAE and Oman, was likely to get worse in many places due to the effects of climate change.
When conditions are perfect for really heavy rain, there’s more moisture in the air, so it rains harder. This extra moisture is because the air is warmer, which is because of human-caused climate change, she said.
