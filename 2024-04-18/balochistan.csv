1,Dum Pukht gains popularity in twin cities,The Turkish delight has captured the hearts & palates of Pindi and Islamabad residents,"Pakistani cuisine has long been celebrated worldwide for its rich flavours and diverse offerings. However, amidst this culinary tapestry, there has been a notable surge in the popularity of cuisines from other cultures such as Chinese, Turkish, Afghani, and Arabic in Pakistan.
Among these, the tantalising Turkish dish “Dum Pukht” has captured the hearts and palates of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
The term “Dum Pukht” originates from Persian, where “dum” translates to ‘slow cooking over a low flame’ and “pukht” signifies the ‘cooking process’. This cooking style involves using a round, heavy-bottomed pot like a handi (clay pot) to seal in the flavours and cook the food slowly over a gentle flame.
The process includes covering the pot with flour while cooking, creating a steam-sealed environment that infuses the ingredients with rich flavours. Dum Pukht is akin to a pulao, a dish traditionally prepared with meat pieces or a whole goat, cooked to perfection using the steam-sealed technique.
During the holy month of Ramadan, people delight in a variety of sumptuous dishes like Tikka, Seekh Kebab, Biryani, and Karhai gosht. However, when hosting guests, there is a special inclination towards serving distinctive and flavorful dishes like Dum Pukht. This culinary tradition traces its roots back to ancient times, cherished by Central Asian, Turkish, and Iranian communities. Caravans would often prepare Dum Pukht during their travels, creating a culinary experience that transcended borders.
The preparation of Dum Pukht is meticulous, starting with a robust goat, carefully skinned and seasoned with a medley of salt and aromatic spices. Traditionally, a pit is dug in the ground to serve as a makeshift cooking vessel, where the meat is cooked over crackling wood and glowing coal fires, infusing it with tantalizing flavours.
However, modern times have seen a simplified approach to Dum Pukht preparation, making it accessible in food centres across Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
The price range for Dum Pukht varies from Rs3,000 to Rs15,000, offering a single serving that can satisfy the appetites of 5 to 10 people. Despite the current inflationary trends affecting prices, Javed Bangash, a local vendor, mentioned that they have refrained from increasing their prices. Dum Pukht has gained popularity as a preferred dish, especially in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, following its success in Balochistan and KPK.
Notable figures like former federal interior minister Rana Sanaullah Khan, former senator Chaudhary Tanveer Khan, former governor Punjab Muhammad Sarwar, senator Nasir Mehmood Butt, Member of National Assembly Hanif Abbasi, and foreign dignitaries from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have frequented Dum Pukht eateries. This dish not only provides nourishment but also carries a cultural authenticity that resonates with diners worldwide.
As Dum Pukht continues to garner acclaim, there are calls for government incentives to support the hospitality industry amid rising gas prices. This traditional dish satisfies appetites and serves as a beacon of cultural heritage, bringing together communities through shared culinary experiences.

2,Axe falls on Murree THQ medical superintendent,Patients express dissatisfaction with quality of treatment during CM’s visit,"Patients’ dissatisfaction with the quality of treatment at Murree Tehsil Headquarters Hospital (THQ) prompted action from the district health authorities as the medical superintendent (MS) was dismissed from his service.
Scores of patients had voiced their concerns during a recent visit by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
During her visit to Murree THQ, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz observed several issues that patients were facing, including a lack of essential medicines, a shortage of medical staff, patients having to bring their injections, limited testing capabilities, and even the absence of pillows on patients' beds. Dr Islam Abbasi, the MS of Murree THQ, was unable to provide satisfactory explanations for these deficiencies, prompting the chief minister to express her dissatisfaction and reprimand him for the lapses in patient care.
Following the chief minister's directives, the health authorities swiftly took action, dismissing the MS of Murree THQ from his position. Furthermore, plans were set in motion to address the broader healthcare infrastructure needs of the Murree district. As per the chief minister's orders, 200 kanals of land were urgently identified in Dina for the construction of the first district headquarters hospital.
A feasibility report is currently being prepared and is expected to be presented to the chief minister within a week.
The responsibility for preparing the feasibility report has been entrusted to Dr Ijaz Ahmed, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Rawalpindi District Health Authority (DHA). An official, while commenting on the move said this decision reflects a proactive approach by the government to address the deficiencies highlighted during the chief minister's visit and to ensure improved healthcare services for the residents of Murree.
In addition to addressing immediate concerns, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz emphasised the need for a long-term strategy to enhance healthcare infrastructure in Murree.
This includes plans to allocate funding for the construction of the district headquarters hospital in the upcoming financial year, pending the completion of the feasibility report. The chief minister has directed authorities to ensure that the new hospital is equipped with state-of-the-art medical facilities to meet the healthcare needs of the region effectively.
