1,Enlistment in Fourth Schedule: DCs told to submit cases after completion of ‘codal formalities’,"LAHORE: The Punjab home department has instructed the deputy commissioners (DCs), who are conveners of the District...","LAHORE: The Punjab home department has instructed the deputy commissioners (DCs), who are conveners of the District Intelligence Committees (DICs), as well as heads of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), to submit cases for proscription of persons in the Fourth Schedule after observing codal formalities as envisaged under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
The home department says it was compelled to refer back the incomplete cases to the districts concerned to fulfill the codal formalities. “Such a situation warrants delay for enlistment/reenlistment of required persons in the Fourth Schedule; and it is quite likely that during the intervening period the persons being prescribed may escape from the country or any untoward situation may arise,” the department observed.
In two separate letters to all the DCs/conveners of DICs and the CTD, the home department has stated that a person’s name is enlisted in the Fourth Schedule of the Act if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such person is “concerned in terrorism”; an activist, office-bearer or an associate of an organisation kept under observation under section 11D or proscribed under section 11B; and in any way concerned or suspected to be concerned with such organisation or affiliated with any group suspected to be involved in terrorism or sectarianism or acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, any person or organisation proscribed under the ATA 1997.
The department has stated that it was observed while scrutinising the cases for proscription of persons that these were being submitted without observing codal formalities as envisaged under the Act ibid. Therefore, the incomplete cases were referred back to the district concerned to fulfill the codal formalities.
The department says it is also facing serious problems in defending such cases in the Lahore High Court due to lack of evidence and material as required under Section 11EE of the Act.  
“The LHC is setting aside such cases with strong remarks,” it added.
Asserting that the proscription of persons should be treated as “most important” and the cases of persons placed on Fourth Schedule under ATA, 1997 should be reviewed in the meetings of DICs, and only those cases be forwarded to the home department that fulfill the requirements of Section 11EE of ATA, 1997, as well as the instructions already shared, to avoid any future complication or embarrassment in superior courts, and unnecessary delay in processing the cases.  
In a separate letter to the additional inspector general of police, CTD, the home department has stated that the CTD had been declared the leading agency for proscription of persons under Section 11EE of ATA, 1997.
It said the DIC, on the request of the district officer, CTD, considering cases in its meetings and the DCs, forward recommendations of the committee to the home department for proscription of persons.
In pursuant to the dictum laid down by the superior courts, the home department stated that it had prepared guidelines, which should be strictly observed while submitting such cases.
The department has instructed the CTD to provide documentary proof/audio/visual material regarding affiliation of an activist with a proscribed/under observation organisation or group, besides documentary proof of funds collection and registration of criminal cases in this regard.
In case of secret meetings (of a person) with members of proscribed/under observation organisation, audio/visual material and registration of FIR under relevant laws, the home department has sought documentary proof of ‘jihadi training’, if any; CDR data with transcripts of calls or end-to-end audio recording. It should also be established on record that callers on both ends were the same persons whose call data was being used in evidence, the department says.
It also instructs the officials to make available audio/visual material and registration of FIR in case of distribution of hate material by a person, besides audio/visual record of hate speeches and registration of criminal case.
It says the acquittal, discharge or withdrawal of prosecution in a criminal case is not relevant material for the purposes of proscription under Section 11EE of the ATA 1997. It also says conviction other than offences under the Act is no ground for enlistment in the 4th Schedule.
The home department has asked the CTD to instruct its field formation to complete all codal formalities referred to above well in time for submission of cases to the department so as to avoid any future complication, embarrassment in superior courts and unnecessary delay in processing the cases under Section 11EE of ATA, 1997.

Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan heard the petition of the PTI leader, who is a candidate in the by-poll from PP-32, Gujrat.
A counsel for Mr Elahi stated that the police were harassing the supporters and family members of the petitioner. He said lawyers of the petitioner were also harassed during the submission of nomination papers.
He alleged that the returning officer concerned and the Gujrat police had been fully supporting the opposing candidates. He said provincial minister Shafay Hussain had been running the campaign of the rival candidate in the constituency.
He argued that the election laws and the code of conduct were being violated brazenly in the constituency. He asked the court to restrain the ECP and the police from harassing the voters and the polling agents of Mr Elahi. He asked the court to order the ECP to ensure provision of forms 45 and 46 to polling agents after the election process.
The law officers of the ECP and the provincial government denied the charges in the petition.
The judge referred the petition to the ECP with a direction to decide the grievances of the petitioner without delay.

Advocate Safdar Shaheen Pirzada argued on behalf of the petitioner that the hospital administration announced auction conditions contrary to the rules set by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority.
He alleged that seemingly the unlawful conditions had been announced to favour a favourite company by including a clause prohibiting remedy before any court.
He explained that the conditions restrict the successful contractor from approaching any court of law or police against the hospital.

The petitioner’s counsel requested the court to declare the actions of the Shaikh Zayed Hospital’s administration unconstitutional and nullify them.
Justice Hussain suspended the auction process till the next date of hearing and sought written replies form the respondents.

The police presented both leaders in the court following a 14-day physical remand in connection with a first information report (FIR) No 179/23. However, the judge granted a seven-day physical remand of both in another case related to photo-copied documents presented by the prosecution for investigation.
Ms Javed’s father, speaking to reporters outside the court, accused the prosecution of ethical and legal violations. He said the documents, purportedly linking the accused to the May 9 incident, were actually related to events in March 2023, held outside Zaman Park, and were neither distributed nor communicated on May 9 in Mianwali by either Ms Hamza or Ms Javed.  
He said the jail superintendent, under the influence of powerful entities, was illegally denying food to the detainees, leading them to embark on a hunger strike for the past four days.  
The judge directed the jail authorities to ensure that food items, as per the jail manual, are provided by the inmates’ families.
Both women activists remain detained at the Sargodha District Jail for further investigation by Mianwali police, with a scheduled presentation in court next Wednesday. 
Ms Javed’s father said both women endure these hardships to convey their dedication to the freedom of the younger generation.

Armed assailants Tahir and others intercepted them at gunpoint. Later, they shot and killed the brothers near village Sobhaga before fleeing the scene.  
Hajira Batul, mother of the victims, lodged a complaint, leading to the registration of a case against Tahir, Shani, Farhan, Muhammad Ramzan, Tasawar, Faisal, and Allah Bakhsh. After post-mortem, the police handed over the bodies to the heirs.
HONOUR KILLING: Shafqatullah Sago of Thal village allegedly murdered his 22-year-old wife, Nagina, of Chakwal, on suspicions of her extra-marital affair, and declared her death as suicide.  
However, visible signs of violence on her body revealed the crime.  
The police are looking into the case.
SUSPENDED: Commissioner and Municipal Corporation (MC) Administrator Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti has suspended five officials for negligence in their official duties.  
Issuing a stern warning to all building inspectors, rent inspectors, and accountants, Mr Bhatti urged them to improve their performance within a week.  
He said that persistent underperformance would lead to further consequences, possibly including the surrender of accountants. 
Recognising exemplary work, Mr Bhatti awarded certificates of appreciation to two recovery officials and ordered the promotion of one.  
During a performance review meeting at his conference room, the chief officer presented branch-wise performance details. Mr Bhatti instructed to disconnect water and sewage services for users with outstanding bills, take legal action against illegal constructions and connections, and file cases accordingly. He sought performance reports of building inspectors, warning of consequences for those failing to meet standards.
