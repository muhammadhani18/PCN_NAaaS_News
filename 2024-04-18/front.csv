0,"Zardari calls for political reset, reconciliation","Amid opposition protest in joint session, President urges turning challenges into opportunities","President Asif Zardari, while calling for resetting the political atmosphere and reconciliation in the country, urged all the stakeholders on Thursday to take a step back and decide what mattered the most, stressing that challenges could be turned into opportunities with collective efforts.
Addressing the joint parliamentary session to mark the beginning of the new parliamentary year, Zardari shared his vision for the future; envisaging inclusive growth; moving away from polarisation; banishing terrorism; and turning a new page without wasting any time for a new beginning.
The president hoped the political leadership, public institutions, civil society, and youth would successfully overcome the multiple challenges “facing our nation today”, saying: “We can effectively tackle our challenges and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and political reconciliation.”
The president’s call for resetting the political atmosphere came as the government remained embroiled in economic and security challenges as well as facing rigging allegations from the opposition parties, who had recently kicked off a protest movement against Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government.
The schism was evident as the start of the first year of the current parliament wasn’t a smooth one. Opposition parties kept protesting and shouting slogans when the president came to address the joint session. In response, the president kept on smiling with frequent intervals.
“I believe we can reset political atmosphere to reflect more light than heat if we really want to,” Zardari, who is serving as the head of the state for a second time, said. “But it will need all of us to step back and decide what matters the most, and I mean all of us,” he added.
At the end of the day, he said, “it is up to all of us to turn challenges into opportunities, because that is what robust nations do.” He added: “It is time to turn a new page… we have little time to waste. The country needs us to move on from the polarization to common now, to contemporary politics.”
While sharing briefly his vision for the future, he emphasized that much of it was based on “the choices we” make. “I see my role today as a unifying symbol of a joint, robust federation, where all people and provinces should be treated as equal before the law,” he said.
Zardari called for a new beginning and building on strengths by investing in people, focusing on public needs, and harnessing resources to create pathways to inclusive growth. He stressed the need to rebuild public confidence in the parliamentary system.
However, in the same vein, he made one thing clear: “Let us not confuse constructive disagreement and the healthy noise of a growing democracy with the pursuit of zero-sum thinking.” The country, he said, “needs us to take pause and reflect on what we prioritize in our goals, our narratives, and our agendas”.
Expressing that the challenges being faced were not impossible to overcome, he said that they just required the fundamentals of meaningful dialogue, parliamentary consensus, and a time-lined implementation of rigorous reforms, aimed at addressing the underlying issues, both old and new. “Let’s begin with a vision that strives to leave no one behind,” he said.
He underscored the importance of promoting positive working relationships and effective coordination, within the Constitutional framework, between the federal government and the provinces, adding this was absolutely essential to promote an inclusive national development agenda and rolling out policies that executed tangible action on the ground.
Economy & climate
President Zardari said that Pakistan needed all hands on deck to revitalize its economy. Without shedding all caution to the winds, he added, the primary objective should be to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).
The president urged the government to intensify its efforts to implement comprehensive ease-of-doing-business reforms and simplify the existing forest of regulations in order to provide an enabling environment for both foreign and domestic investors.
At the same time, he said that “we must accelerate our endeavors to diversify exports, enhance the competitiveness of our products” in the global markets, introduce value-addition, and venture into new markets.
Similarly, the president continued, that the huge, untapped potential in the agriculture, marine life, information technology, and textile sectors should be exploited to earn foreign exchange.
Sharing that the “world is changing fast under our very feet”, the president said that the country urgently needed to invest in climate-friendly and climate-resilient infrastructure to mitigate the rapidly compounding risks of climate change.
At the same time, he said, Pakistan needed to ensure that clean energy technologies form the “core component of our national energy mix” as they would not only create opportunities for green economic growth but would also make energy more affordable for the people.
Education & Health
President Zardari emphasized that the provision of primary and secondary education was a fundamental right of the people. However, he regretted the poor state of this sector. “Its current state should keep all governments awake at night,” Zardari said.
Referring to a massive number of out-of-school children, he urged all provincial governments to bring focus and energy to transformative reforms in the education sector, not just on improving access to primary and secondary education for all children, but for ensuring quality education as well.
Similarly, the president pointed out that the health sector was also in urgent need of rebuilding and scaled-up expansion. He said that it was needed to ensure that every citizen had access to quality healthcare services and that no citizen lacked medical care.
Social sector
The president said that a combination of factors had come together to create a crisis of income and food insecurity for many people. Referring to the large number of the population slipping into poverty, he warned: “It is our responsibility to ensure that they move out of extreme vulnerability.”
The president revealed that the beneficiaries of the poverty alleviation program, the Benazir Income Support Programme, had risen to over 9 million but added that more underprivileged women needed to be brought into the social safety net.
Zardari said he hoped that the new government would actively work to reduce social and economic fragility while aggressively promoting girls’ education and health, including programs to reduce maternal mortality and enhance mother and child nutrition.
Terrorism
In his speech, the president warned that the menace of terrorism was again rearing its ugly head and threatening the nation’s security as well as regional peace and prosperity but affirmed the resolve that the country would be purged of this scourge.
He said that he expected neighboring countries to take strong notice of terrorist groups, which were involved in launching attacks against the Pakistani forces and the people. “I reaffirm the nation’s resolve to eliminate terrorist elements,” Zardari said.
He recalled that his late wife, the twice-elected prime minister of Pakistan, Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed, gave her life standing up to terrorists. “So you will never find me wanting in building the unity and momentum behind such an effort [against terrorism].”
The president said that the nation was proud of the armed forces and law-enforcement agencies, who had rendered immense sacrifices and played a heroic role in the fight against terrorism and the defense of the national frontiers.
Friendly countries
The president thanked the friendly countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Turkiye, and Qatar, which always supported Pakistan in difficult times. He extended heartfelt gratitude to China for its unwavering support to Pakistan in various fields.
It was also important, he continued, to recognize that the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom had all been established trade partners, with a history of cooperation in many sectors, which we hope will grow.
“The enduring strategic and all-weather friendship between Pakistan and China is a cornerstone of stability in the region,” the president said, adding that Pakistan would remain steadfast in its commitment to collaborating with China to advance the shared goals of fostering peace and prosperity.
He vowed to complete the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). “We will not allow hostile elements to jeopardize this vital project or undermine the strong bond between our two nations and will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of our Chinese brothers and sisters.”
Kashmir & Palestine
Zardari reminded the world of the unsung sacrifices of the Kashmiri people in their ongoing struggle for the freedom of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). He stressed that durable peace in South Asia was the resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN resolutions.
“Revocation of Articles 370 and 35A [of the Indian constitution] is part of India’s strategy to reduce the Kashmiri Muslims to a minority in their own homeland,” he said. “Pakistan rejects the one-sided Indian actions and calls upon India to reverse all illegal measures taken on or after 5 August 2019.”
The president assured the Kashmiri brothers and sisters that Pakistan would continue to provide moral, political, and diplomatic support to the people of occupied Kashmir until they achieve their right to self-determination.
Similarly, the president said that he was deeply concerned over “the tidal wave of indiscriminate killings of innocent Palestinians and large-scale genocide committed by the Israeli forces.” He said Pakistan strongly condemns the brutality and impunity of the occupation forces.
He reiterated that Pakistan remained steadfast in its principled support for the establishment of an independent and viable state of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
In conclusion, Zardari said that he had complete faith in the capability of the political leadership, public institutions, civil society, and youth, to successfully overcome the multiple challenges facing the nation today.
Sharing that he had an unshakeable belief in the resilience of the people, the president said, he believed that the nation could pull together to draw on the moral and political capital in steering the country out of its complex but not impossible, social, climate and economic challenges.
Calling for a renewed political ethos of collaboration and consensus-building, President Zardari said that he was certain that “together, in a fresh start, we can chart a course towards a strong and prosperous Pakistan”.

2,"K-P, Balochistan battle historical rains, storms and floods",NDMA says three new systems to hit country this month,"As Balochistan reeled from devastating floods, it braced for another wet spell, starting Thursday (today), which could bring heavy downpours accompanied by thunderstorms and hailstorms, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Wednesday.
Overall at least 65 people have died in rain-related incidents, including 28 killed in lightning strikes, across the country, according to the media reports, with rain so far in April falling at nearly twice the historical average rate for the month.
The largest death toll was in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), where 32 people have died, including 15 children, and more than 1,300 homes have been damaged. Nearly, two-dozen people, including farmers harvesting wheat, were killed by lightning in Punjab, the reports said.
In Balochistan, recent heavy rainfall unleashed devastating flash floods across the province's coastal belt, wreaking havoc in Gwadar, Pasni, and other areas. Gwadar bore the brunt of the onslaught, with nearly all public and private buildings submerged under the deluge.
In Pasni and surrounding regions, communities found themselves grappling with the catastrophic aftermath of the floods. The floods spared neither schools nor homes, leaving education institutions submerged and countless residences damaged.
Pictures posted on social media depict individuals wading through waist-deep waters, desperately trying to salvage their belongings amid chaos. Tragically, the death toll from the disaster also climbed, which rose to nine fatalities so far.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed the grim statistics of nine dead and another nine injured, highlighting the enormity of the situation. The government has declared a state of emergency, mobilising resources to aid affected communities.
However, the scale of destruction is staggering, with 40 homes completely destroyed and 80 others partially damaged by the ferocious downpour. The floods also wreaked havoc with infrastructure, leaving roads and highways impassable, thus disrupting traffic and communication networks.
The true extent of the damage will become evident, once the water recedes. Currently, efforts are under way to provide relief and support to those impacted by the calamity, emphasising the urgent need for solidarity in the face of nature's fury.
K-P and Punjab
Ten more people, including nine children, died on Tuesday in various parts of K-P in the aftermath of the torrential rains as the provincial government imposed an emergency in 13 districts for the provision of relief and restoration of damaged communication networks and water supply.
“All the casualties [in K-P] resulted from the collapse of walls and roofs,” Anwar Khan, spokesman for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), told AFP on Wednesday. Villagers were forced to seek refuge on higher ground, including on the shoulders of motorways.
“In April, we have observed highly unusual rainfall patterns,” Zaheer Babar, spokesperson for the Pakistan Meteorological Department, told AFP. “Climate change is a major factor behind these unusual weather patterns and above normal rainfalls,” he added.
Most of the country experienced a pause in rain on Tuesday and Wednesday, but more downpours are predicted in the coming days. “From April 1st to April 17th, we experienced precipitation levels exceeding the historical average by 99%,” Babar said, citing data from the past 30 years as a comparison.
Amid a grim situation in the province, the NDMA in its latest advisory warned of a series of moderate to intense weather systems causing rainfall and thunderstorms from April 17 to 29, citing the latest projections from the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC).
The forecast indicated that the latest weather system would bring heavy rainfall and thunderstorms, lasting until April 22 – in Balochistan from April 17-19, in Punjab and Sindh from April 18-19. The advisory stated that upper Punjab would experience the effects from April 18-21.
K-P, Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B), and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) will also be affected from April 17 to 22,” the advisory said, adding that a weaker weather system was expected to enter Pakistan on April 23, bringing low rainfall and thunderstorms till April 24.
According to the NDMA, Balochistan and upper Punjab would experience slight impacts from April 23-24 weather system, but K-P, G-B, and AJK would be affected. However, Sindh was not expected to be impacted during this period, it added.
Then, a strong weather system was forecast to enter Pakistan on April 25, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, and hailstorms with occasional gaps until April 29. “This system will affect Balochistan from April 25 to April 29, with intermittent gaps,” the NDMA said.
“Sindh will experience impacts on April 25, 26, and 28, while South Punjab will be affected from April 27-28. Upper Punjab will face the impact from April 26 to 29, while K-P will experience effects from 25 to 29, potentially. G-B and AJK would also be impacted from April 25 to 29.
The expected rainfall might trigger flash floods in local nullahs of vulnerable areas, including Khuzdar, Ziarat, Zhob, Sherani, Muslim Bagh, Quetta, Pishin, Kech, Panjgur, Gwadar, and Turbat. Flooding might also occur in low-lying areas during the forecast period, particularly in south-western Balochistan.
In the light of these projections, the NDMA has issued instructions for the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs), District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs), and other relevant line departments to remain vigilant and prepared to respond to any emergent situations.

3,Govt okays tax law tweaks to recover Rs1.7tr disputed taxes,Bill to be tabled before NA as a money bill for approval,"The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved, in principle, to amend Pakistan’s three tax laws to abolish one judicial forum available to aggrieved taxpayers and proposed to reduce the time period to file appeals against tax cases in high courts from three to just one month.
According to the Tax Laws Amendment Bill 2024, the high courts have been proposed to make it legally bound to decide the tax-related cases within six months. Only special benches of high courts can hear the tax matters.
The cost of seeking justice has also been proposed to increase by 150% in the case of individuals and 300% for companies.
The bill will now be tabled before the new National Assembly as a money bill for its approval – a form of legislation where the Senate does not have voting powers.
The bill has been introduced to recover trillions of rupees revenues stuck up in the courts. However, the majority of these disputed sums are irrecoverable due to questionable tax provisions like collecting taxes in areas that are constitutionally in the domain of the provinces – the infamous section 7E.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has also raised hundreds of billions of rupees in demands in the past either to meet tax targets or under political compulsions against the sugar sector during the PTI tenure.
A cabinet minister confirmed to The Express Tribune that the federal cabinet has, in principle, approved the Tax Laws Amendment Bill. But it would be further fine-tuned in light of the discussion that took place in the federal cabinet before it was laid before the National Assembly for approval.
The high courts will be legally bound to decide the tax cases within six months, according to the proposed bill. It has been proposed to abolish the forum of the commissioner appeals out of the four legal platforms that are currently available to the taxpayers.
The commissioner appeals is the first tier, followed by the appellate tribunal, high courts and the Supreme Court.
Some of the cabinet members questioned the implications of the proposed law on the taxpayers, particularly for the companies. Through the legal amendments, the government has also proposed to halve the limit of the disputed tax amount that can be taken to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Committee (ADRC) for resolution.
As against the current limit of Rs100 million, it has been proposed that up to Rs50 million cases can also be taken to the ADRC for amicable resolution. However, the limit for the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) will remain at Rs100 million. According to the bill, as against the current period of making an appeal to the high courts against the appellate tribunals’ decisions in three months, the period has been cut to just one month.
The position of the commissioner of inland revenue has been proposed to be deleted from the laws. The government has proposed to set up a new directorate general of law, which will be headed by a director general and assisted by additional, deputy and assistant directors and the law officers.
The government has proposed to abolish section 45 B of the Sales Tax Act, denying the taxpayers a right to file appeals within 30 days against the decisions of the FBR officers. Instead, the appeal can now be filed in front of the appellate tribunals within 30 days. All appeals and proceedings under this Act pending before commissioner appeals shall stand transferred to the appellate tribunal with immediate effect.
Similarly, all pending appeals and proceedings including rectification and remand back proceedings and recovery orders pending before commissioner appeals shall be deemed to have been filed before the appellate tribunals.
At present any person dissatisfied with any order passed by a commissioner or an officer of inland revenue may file an appeal against the decision of the FBR to the commissioner appeals. The appellate tribunals have also been proposed to be strengthened through the hiring of expensive legal minds.
A person shall be eligible to be appointed as a member of the appellate tribunal if he has been an advocate of a high court for not less than 15 years and has for not less than 10 years practised professionally as a chartered accountant.
An officer of the inland revenue in BS-21 or above; or an officer of the inland revenue in BS-20, having served in such grade for three years or more can also be appointed as member of the appellate tribunals. The cost of appeal has been increased from Rs5,000 in the case of a company to Rs20,000 – a 300% jump.
The price is increased from Rs2,000 in cases other than a company to Rs5,000 – a 150% surge. The appellate tribunal may stay the recovery of tax for three months but it will decide the appeal within three months of the filing. The appeals that were already pending before the appellate tribunals would be decided within six months.
The appellate tribunal will not increase the amount of any assessment or penalty or decrease the amount of any refund unless the taxpayer has been given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against such increase or decrease, according to the proposed law. Within 30 days of the communication of the order of the appellate tribunal, the aggrieved person or the commissioner may appeal before the high court, stating any question of law arising out of such order.
The special benches of the high courts will hear the tax case, consisting of not less than two judges of the high court.
The special bench shall decide on a reference within six months from the date of its filing. The high court may stay in the recovery of tax, subject to deposit with the assessing authority of not less than 30% of the tax determined by the appellate tribunal.
Where recovery of tax has been stayed by the high court by an order, such order shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of six months following the day on which it was made unless the appeal is decided or such order is withdrawn by the high court earlier, according to the bill.
