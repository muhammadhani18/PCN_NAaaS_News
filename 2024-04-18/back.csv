0,PTI disavows Marwat's allegations of Saudi role in 'regime change’,"Firebrand leader had suggested that Saudi Arabia, alongside the US, played a part in downfall of Imran Khan's govt","The central leadership of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its spokesperson have distanced themselves from the views expressed by firebrand party leader Sher Afzal Marwat in a private TV program regarding Saudi Arabia's alleged role in a supposed 'regime change operation', which the party blames for the overthrow of Imran Khan’s government.
During a segment on a private TV channel yesterday, Marwat suggested that Saudi Arabia, alongside the United States, played a part in the downfall of Imran Khan's government. This statement coincided with a high-profile visit from Saudi Arabia, led by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
In response, the PTI issued a statement on Wednesday asserting that Marwat's views do not reflect the party's strategy or stance in any manner. The party clarified that his statement is his personal opinion and not endorsed by the PTI leadership or its members at any level.
The spokesperson highlighted the importance of Pakistan's relationship with Saudi Arabia, terming it as one of the country's closest and most trusted brotherly Islamic nations. He underlined the mutual respect, trust, and brotherhood between PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister His Excellency Mohammad bin Salman, which the party values highly.

Furthermore, the spokesperson reiterated PTI's commitment to fostering close cooperation and brotherhood between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The party expressed well wishes for the welfare and development of Saudi leadership and people, reaffirming PTI's dedication to playing a constructive role in this regard.
The latest development adds to a series of controversies involving Marwat, who has previously caused internal discord within the party.
Earlier this month, Imran Khan reportedly removed Marwat from key party positions, including as a focal person and from the group responsible for vetting individuals permitted to meet Khan at Adiala Jail.
Additionally, Marwat was instructed to disband his social media team. These decisions were said to have been made based on recommendations from the PTI core committee.

1,Provinces told to step up wheat purchase,Minister stresses need for buying crop from farmers at rates fixed by Centre,"Federal National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer has sent a letter to the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan to speed up the government procurement of wheat keeping in mind the sensitivity of the wheat crop, production, storage, smuggling, and different types of weather in the provinces.
Tanveer, who is also the federal minister for industries and production, has also asked the chief ministers to review their wheat procurement targets and ensure that purchased the crop from farmers on time.
He added that the provincial governments should take appropriate and necessary measures to meet their wheat procurement targets.
The minister stressed the need to purchase wheat from farmers at the rates fixed by the Centre. He added that the federal government was well aware of the challenges faced by growers.
On Friday, the federal government fixed the wheat procurement target at 2.5 million metric tons, which was 69% lower than the one in the current year because of the absence of Punjab from the campaign. It also allowed loans of Rs275 billion for the purchase of the crop.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet approved wheat procurement targets for the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco), Sindh, and Balochistan. Punjab did not share its financing requirement and wheat procurement plan.
The ECC fixed Sindh’s wheat purchase target at 1 million tons, down 28% from last year, and authorized the provincial government to get a loan of Rs100 billion. Sindh will buy the commodity from farmers at Rs4,000 per 40 kg. It owes commercial banks Rs77 billion on account of commodity operations.
The ECC approved a procurement target of 50,000 metric tons for Balochistan and sanctioned a borrowing limit of Rs 5.7 billion for the provincial government. K-P’s production of 1.4 million tons is expected to remain below the target by 200,000 tons.

2,LHC summons ECP lawyer over RO office change,PTI candidate raises concerns about potential malpractice and electoral rigging suspicions," 
The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday summoned the lawyer of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for further proceedings over a plea against the relocation of the returning officer office in Wazirabad ahead of by-polls.
Fayyaz Chattha, the former district Nazim of Gujranwala and son of veteran politician Hamid Nasir Chattha, is currently contesting the upcoming by-election in PP-36, Wazirabad.
In a hearing presided over by Justice Shahid Bilal Hasan, the court addressed the petition filed by Fayyaz Chattha, which challenges the decision to shift the RO office of Wazirabad’s PP-36 constituency. The ECP and other relevant parties have been included in the petition.
The petition argued that the relocation of the RO office to Gujranwala from Wazirabad raises concerns, as it means that the 185 polling officers of the constituency would have to travel approximately 50 km to access the results.
This, the petition contended, could potentially facilitate malpractice and raise suspicions of electoral rigging.
Suspecting alleged malice behind the decision, the petition urged the court to intervene and order the establishment of the returning officer office in Wazirabad, maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.
It is notable that despite being a candidate backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Fayyaz Chattha is contesting the by-poll under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), following the policy of his party.
The PP-36 seat became vacant after Fayyaz Chattha's younger brother, Muhammad Ahmed Chattha, relinquished it. Muhammad Ahmed Chattha, who had won the election on two seats, including an NA seat, opted to retain the NA seat, leaving the provincial assembly.
With the by-election scheduled for April 21, candidates have intensified their electioneering efforts following the recent Eid respite.

3,JUI-F challenges own lawmaker’s election,Tells SC Sadaf Ihsan obtained seat with party members’ complicity,"The JUI has challenged the election of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly member Sadaf Ihsan, elected on the reserved seats of women, in the Supreme Court.
Sadaf had been a provincial assembly member of the JUI.
The party filed a petition in the apex court against the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) decision regarding the election of Sadaf Ihsan, seeking suspension of the notification for the lawmaker as a member of the K-P Assembly.
The JUI adopted the stance that Sadaf Ihsan’s name was not on the priority list submitted by the party.
It maintained that the name of Sadaf Yasmeen was given on the priority list for reserved seats of women which was submitted to the ECP by the party, adding that Yasmeen did not show her interest in the seat.
The party stated that Sadaf Ihsan obtained Sadaf Yasmeen’s seat with the alleged complicity of some party members. It said when the ECP started inquiry into the matter, Sadaf Ihsan approached the PHC following which the court approved her writ and ordered the issuance of notification for her as a member of the assembly.
The JUI petition stated that the PHC order was against the Constitution and law.

5,Islamabad bar seeks probe into IHC judges' letter,Urges SC to identify and punish those intimidating judiciary,"The Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) has filed a petition in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3), requesting an investigation into a letter written by six IHC judges alleging threats and interference in judicial affairs.
The petition asserts that the stance taken by the IHC judges raises serious concerns, and failure to thoroughly investigate this matter could erode public trust in the justice system.
It highlights that the IHC judges have outlined serious incidents in the letter, indicating external interference in the courts and subversion of the judicial process.
The petition emphasizes that this is a matter of interference in the affairs of a high court and subordinate judiciary, thus holding significant importance, as an independent judiciary is the guardian of the Constitution and the sole provider of justice.
An appeal has been made to the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter under Article 184(3) of the Constitution to safeguard judicial freedom. It requests transparent investigations be conducted in light of the letter, and actions be taken against those undermining the judiciary.
Additionally, if the matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), the Supreme Court should send recommendations to the SJC for review.
On March 26, six of the eight judges of the capital’s high court wrote a letter to the SJC chairman—Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa—highlighting alleged “interference” by the “operatives of intelligence agencies” in judicial affairs of the court.
The judges, including Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, sought guidance from SJC regarding the duty of a judge to report and respond to actions on the part of “members of the executive, including operatives of intelligence agencies, that seek to interfere with the discharge of his/her official functions and qualify as intimidation”.
The letter also requested guidance with regard to the duty of a judge to report any such actions that come to his attention concerning “colleagues and/or members of the courts that the IHC supervises”. The letter sparked controversy, prompting the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice of the matter.

6,Dharna report shrouded in mystery,"AGP office clueless about report's whereabouts, denies any knowledge of its submission to SC","The saga surrounding the Faizabad dharna commission report remains shrouded in ambiguity, with the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) office denying any knowledge of its submission to the Supreme Court.
Speculation abounds regarding the whereabouts of the elusive report, with conflicting accounts further complicating the matter. While some assert that the commission had indeed forwarded the report to the federal government, others challenge this assertion.
A senior official in the AGP office disclosed to The Express Tribune that the report has yet to land on the Attorney General's desk. Even AGP Mansoor Awan remains in the dark about its contents, he added.
The source elaborated that, theoretically, the commission should have handed over the report to the federal government.
However, rumors swirl that the report did land in the AGP office, only to be promptly returned for reasons shrouded in mystery. In contrast, one source asserts that a single copy of the report, along with a summary of its findings, has been lodged at the SC Registrar's office.
Interestingly, a senior journalist possesses a copy of the report, while other members of the media are relying solely on excerpts from the summary outlining the commission's conclusions.‘Damage has been done. Meanwhile, a senior lawyer asserts that the damage has already been done, and altering the report would only add to the embarrassment of the current government.
The inquiry commission concluded that the then Punjab government, under Shehbaz Sharif's leadership, failed to quell the protesters' sit-in.
However, former law minister Rana Sanaullah countered, stating that they refrained from taking coercive action against the protesters based on intelligence reports from security agencies, he added.
All eyes now turn to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, as anticipation mounts over his stance on implementing the February 2019 judgment regarding the Faizabad dharna. Currently presiding over the bench at the Lahore Registry, his decisions are eagerly awaited.
Senior lawyers speculate on the potential ramifications of the commission's purported findings, which may have ripple effects on the narrative of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N), particularly regarding allegations of security establishment involvement in past protests.
The PML-N leaders have consistently blamed the security establishment for orchestrating protests against their government (2013-18). Moreover, CJP Isa found himself embroiled in the aftermath, with a presidential reference filed against him in response to the Faizabad dharna judgment.
In fact, the security establishment's discontent with the judgment was palpable, leading to a meeting of senior lawyers in Rawalpindi to discuss its implications.
One of the participants of the meeting, talking to The Express Tribune, revealed that high-ranking officials within the security establishment were incensed by CJP Isa's actions.
Subsequently, several government departments, including the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and PEMRA, challenged it. However, the AGP office showed little interest in filing review petitions.
Curiously, the commission's stance on the filing of review petitions remains undocumented. The inquiry commission was also tasked with investigating whether all the review petitions submitted by various government departments against the Faizabad Dharna judgment were coincidental or were filed pursuant to instructions from a single source. This was also explicitly mentioned in the Terms of Reference (TORs).
Likewise, senior journalist Absar Alam accused former senior military officer General Faiz Hameed of interference during his tenure as chairman of PEMRA.
He was asked by the SC to submit his statement before the inquiry commission, although the commission's findings regarding Alam's allegations remain undisclosed.
Meanwhile, the acceptance of the inquiry commission's findings by the security establishment remains uncertain. While the commission purportedly absolved General Faiz Hameed, it also recommended limiting the military's involvement in internal affairs and empowering the Intelligence Bureau (IB).
Legal experts assert that clarity will emerge following the official release of the report.

7,CJ Isa to hear cases in Karachi,"CJ will hear diverse civil and criminal cases, reinforcing judicial oversight","Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa will hear various civil and criminal cases at the Supreme Court’s Karachi registry for five days—from April 22 to April 26.
The CJ will head a three-member bench also comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan.
The Supreme Court was restructured in its modern form in 1956 by the Part VIII of the Constitution, which stipulates that the ""judicial power of Pakistan, shall be vested in one Supreme Court"" together with any lower courts [that] Congress may establish.
Article 185(1) further specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created four judicial high courts, and a system of entering an appeal against punishment rendered by the high courts.

8,TLP pact not approved by then-PM: Ahsan,Minister tells commission negotiators showed agreement to Abbasi after signing it,"Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has disclosed before the Faizabad inquiry commission that negotiators signed an agreement with the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in November 2017 without obtaining endorsement from then-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.
Iqbal, who served in Abbasi's cabinet as the interior minister, stated that the former PM had raised objections to the agreement with the protestors. However, he was informed that since the agreement had been signed, the government could not retract its stance.
Earlier this week, the Faizabad sit-in probe commission cleared spy agencies as well as former spymaster Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed, emphasizing that high-ups of the then government did not accuse agency officials of aiding the TLP protestors in 2017.
Instead, the three-member commission held the political leadership, including the then Punjab chief minister – now the prime minister – Shehbaz Sharif, among others, responsible for allowing the TLP protestors to enter Islamabad without resistance due to fears of losing their vote bank.
In November last year, a caretaker government formed a three-member commission to identify those who planned, financed, and supported the sit-in in the Faizabad area, which disrupted life in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad between November 6 and November 27, 2017.
In its report, released on Tuesday, the commission observed that high-ups of former provincial and federal governments did not accuse the agencies or any other officials of aiding the TLP protestors, and no evidence to the contrary was presented.
""Since no one, including the former prime minister, former interior minister, former law minister, and former chief minister of Punjab, accused intelligence agencies or any other officials of facilitating the protestors, nor was any other evidence brought forward, the commission could not implicate any organization or state official in supporting the TLP to organize the dharna.""
According to the report, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Ahsan Iqbal, former law minister Zahid Hamid, former Punjab chief minister Shehbaz Sharif, and former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Aftab Sultan were specifically questioned about the alleged role of agencies in facilitating the march. ""They all denied the involvement of any organ or person of the state in such activity,"" the report stated.
It added that Iqbal informed the commission that, lacking alternatives, the federal government engaged the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to communicate with the TLP leadership and sign an agreement that ended the protest.
The report noted that Lt-Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed, who was a major general at the time and held the position of director general (C) in the ISI, had to sign the agreement on behalf of the security establishment as a mediator between the two parties with the permission of the then ISI chief and the chief of army staff.
Based on the available records, the commission concluded that the Faizabad sit-in was more a result of the lack of courage or conviction of the leader handling the issue, particularly the Punjab government. It stated that both the provincial and federal governments hesitated in addressing the issue at the initial stage.
The report also highlighted differing approaches of the federal government and the Punjab government in dealing with the issue. While Abbasi initially urged the Punjab government to contain the protest within its jurisdiction, Chief Minister Shehbaz ""advised them to allow the TLP to proceed to Islamabad.""
The commission, led by Syed Akhtar Ali Shah, a former civil servant who also served as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s police chief, included Tahir Alam Khan, a former IG of Islamabad, and Khushal Khan, an additional secretary at the Ministry of Interior.
In its report spanning 149 pages, with 57 annexures and sub-annexures, and one appendix, the commission also highlighted a lack of coordination between Rawalpindi and Islamabad police. During the sit-in, seven people were killed, and 277, including police and FC officials, were injured.

9,FIA cites cipher audios during appeal hearing,IHC asks why the interior secretary and not the foreign secretary moved the complaint in the case,"The lawyer representing the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday told the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that in some leaked audios, former prime minister Imran Khan could be heard discussing his plan to use a classified diplomatic telegram to get political mileage.
FIA prosecutor Hamid Ali Shah resumed his arguments before an IHC division bench, hearing Imran Khan’s and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s appeals against their conviction in a case related to alleged misuse of a diplomatic cipher during the final days of the PTI government.
An audio clip of an alleged conversation between former prime minister Imran Khan and his principal secretary Azam Khan surfaced on September 28, 2022.
In the leaked conversation, Imran was purportedly heard speaking about “playing with the United States’ conspiracy” to topple his government. Azam was then heard advising Imran to hold a meeting with Qureshi and former foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood to bring this on record by faking the minutes of the meeting.
In another audio clip that appeared on September 30, 2022, Imran Khan, former minister Asad Umar, and Azam Khan could allegedly be heard discussing the US cipher in a meeting and how to use it in their interest.
Talking with reference to the audios, Hamid Ali Shah said the FIA had discussed the alleged conversations between Imran and his lieutenants in a report submitted to the trial court.
The bench—comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb— inquired if the report confirmed that the audios were genuine. The counsel replied that in the audio, the PTI founder could be heard advising his subordinate to “play with the cipher”.
Presenting an overview of the case, the FIA counsel said after approval of the federal cabinet, former Secretary Interior Yousaf Naseem Khokhar lodged an initial complaint with the FIA against the former PM and FM in October 2022.  Secretary Interior Aftab Durrani filed additional complaints with the FIA in September 2023 to fulfill the required provisions of the Official Secrets Act, of 1923.
He said the FIA arrested Imran on August 16, 2023, and Shah Mahmood Qureshi on August 19, 2023. The trial court indicted the accused on October 23, 2023.
The IHC later annulled the court proceedings and the trial court once again indicted the accused on December 13, 2023. He said the court nominated state counsels for the accused on January 26, 2024, due to ""delaying tactics"" employed by the lawyers of Imran and Qureshi.
“The state counsels concluded cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses by January 27. The trial court delivered its verdict on January 30,” he said.
The bench asked the FIA’s lawyer as to why the interior secretary and not the foreign secretary lodged the complaint against the PTI leaders.
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb noted that there is a need for a comparative analysis of the competence of the PTI leaders’ lawyers and the lawyers assigned to them by the Islamabad advocate general. The court later adjourned till April 22.
