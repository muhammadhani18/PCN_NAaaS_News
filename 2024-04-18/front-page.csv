• Interior secretary defends restrictions before IHC, cites national security concerns
• Says Twitter has not complied with requests of Pakistani authorities
KARACHI / ISLAMABAD: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Wednesday directed the interior ministry to either justify the shutdown of social media platform X or rescind its Feb 17 letter directing the telecom regulator to ban the site.
The high court’s directions came two months after the interior ministry ordered the disruption of X, formerly known as Twitter.
Meanwhile, the ministry also submitted a detailed report before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday, insisting that the site was banned “in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation”.
The social media platform X has been rarely accessible since Feb 17, when the PTI called for protests against the then-Rawalpindi commissioner’s admission of vote manipulation in the Feb 8 elections.
“The Sindh High Court has given the government one week to withdraw the letter, failing which, on the next date, they will pass appropriate orders,” Abdul Moiz Jaferii, a lawyer challenging the ban, told AFP.
During a hearing before a two-judge bench led by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi and Justice Abdul Mubeen, the high court also instructed the Ministry of Interior to submit reasons for imposing an official ban on X.
Advocates Jibran Nasir and Jaferii argued that the government had not provided any legal basis or substantial reasons for the shutdown of X, which they claim violates a prior court order dated Feb 22, thereby constituting contempt of court.
When the bench asked about the reasons behind closure of X, Additional Attorney General Zia Makhdoom contended that the social media platform was working a day ago. However, he sought time to get instructions from the respondents.
The petitioners’ lawyers argued that a huge fine could be imposed on social media platforms carrying misinformation and false news and the service providers were bound to issue a notice before shutting down a social media platform seeking a response, failing which the relevant platform can be closed.
Advocate Jaferii pointed out that before the emergence of the interior ministry’s Feb 17 letter, the PTA had even refused to admit the closure of X and the federal law officers used to mislead the court about the platform’s functioning through virtual private networks (VPNs).
The SHC chief justice said the institutions and courts were there for the benefit of the people and the supremacy of the Constitution. He noted that no justification had so far been produced in court for banning X.
He said the interior ministry must come up with reasons for writing a letter to the PTA for shutting down X or to rescind its Feb 17 letter; otherwise, the court will pass an appropriate order in the next hearing on May 9.
The bench was hearing a set of identical petitions filed against the suspension of mobile internet and broadband services during and before general elections, as well as the outage of social media platforms, including X, across the country.
At the previous hearing, the interior ministry informed the SHC that the social media platform X was blocked in February till further orders on the reports of intelligence agencies.
In its earlier interim order, the SHC directed the respondents to ensure the provision of smooth and uninterrupted internet services, as well as access to social media platforms, unless relevant laws were invoked and also specifically ordered to restore X if there was no justification or reasonable grounds for its closure.
‘Ban necessary to protect national integrity’
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) received a detailed report from Interior Secretary Khurram Agha on Wednesday, defending the temporary suspension of X citing national interest and security concerns.
The report, submitted before IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, said the social media platform was not registered in Pakistan nor was it under any obligation to comply with Pakistani laws.
It claimed that X had “not complied with the requests of Pakistani authorities” after the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)’s cybercrime wing forwarded numerous requests via the Pakistan Telecommun­ication Authority (PTA) to take “significant action to block accounts involved in a defamatory campaign against the honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan”.
Noting that the FIA’s wing had initiated several FIRs against hundreds of Twitter accounts, the interior ministry asserted that the “lack of cooperation from Twitter/X authorities in addressing content that violates Pakistani laws and values further justifies the need for regulatory measures, including the temporary ban”.
“The government of Pakistan has no alternative but to temporarily block access/suspend the operation of this platform within Pakistan,” it said.
The report said the interior ministry had on Feb 17 asked for blocking of X immediately till further orders on the reports of intelligence agencies.
“The decision to impose a ban on Twitter/X in Pakistan was made in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation,” it contended, adding that the decision was taken after considering “various confidential reports received from intelligence and security agencies of Pakistan”.
It emphasised that “hostile elements operating on Twitter/X have nefarious intentions to create an environment of chaos and instability, with the ultimate goal of destabilising the country and plunging it into some form of anarchy”.
“The ban on Twitter serves as a necessary step to disrupt the activities of these elements and prevent them from achieving their destructive objectives,” the report said.
It noted that X was neither registered in Pakistan nor had it signed an agreement to abide by local laws. It said the platform’s “failure to establish a legal presence or engage in meaningful cooperation with Pakistani authorities underscores the need for regulatory measures to ensure accountability and adherence to national laws”.
“The ban on Twitter/X serves as a necessary step to address this regulatory vacuum and compel the platform to respect the sovereignty and legal jurisdiction of Pakistan,” the interior ministry added.
It said social media platforms were extensively used to propagate extremist ideologies and fake information, adding that some miscreants were using social media as a tool to create a law and order situation and destabilise Pakistan.
It said the ban on X was not to restrict access to information but to streamline the use of social media platforms, and the interior ministry was under obligation to protect citizens’ rights and national interests.
It pointed out that TikTok was also banned earlier and was only restored after it agreed to abide by the law of the land.
Justice Farooq adjou­rned further hearing in the petition till May 2.

• PM Shehbaz asks Chinese to boost investments in coal sector
• Information minister says private Saudi investors to visit Pakistan ‘soon’
ISLAMABAD: Anticipating a bumper wheat crop, the federal cabinet on Wednesday decided to write a letter to all provinces to enhance their wheat procurement targets and set a good price for the commodity to facilitate farmers and ensure the availability of the staple in the market.
During a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the Ministry of National Food Security and Research to work out an effective strategy in coordination with provincial governments for achieving the wheat procurement target.
“Bumper wheat crop is expected in the country and letters are being written to all four provinces to increase their wheat procurement target so that the farmers can get a better reward for their hard work,” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said at a press conference after the cabinet meeting.
During the meeting, PM Shehbaz said Saudi investments to the tune of billions of dollars were expected to land in the country following a visit of the Saudi delegation led by its foreign minister. “We must ensure the completion of this investment in Pakistan with the same spirit and dedication,” he said, adding that there would be no hindrances.
“It is a good omen that Pakistan, a strategically located nuclear state, is in the news for good reasons, especially on the economic front,” he said, adding that the news about “improvement” in Pakistan’s economy from international institutions and journals was also encouraging.
At the presser, Minister Tarar revealed that a delegation of private investors from Saudi Arabia would also visit Pakistan soon and hold meetings for collaboration in various fields.
In response to a question about the Faizabad sit-in commission report which suggested legislation to regulate the intelligence agencies, the information minister said the federal cabinet did not discuss the commission’s report.
Cabinet decisions
The cabinet approved a bill regarding the establishment of the Institute of Modern Sciences in Wah Cantonment. In this regard, the prime minister directed to form a committee to further “improve the procedure” for establishing new universities and higher education institutions. The committee headed by the education minister would include the petroleum minister, the IT minister, and the attorney general for Pakistan as its members.
The cabinet, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, allowed former ambassador Manzoor Ahmad Chaudhry to receive the Commandeur de L’Ordre award from the government of Cote d’Ivoire in recognition of his services.
On the recommendation of the Ministry of Law and Justice, the meeting approved the conversion of Accountability Court-VIII Karachi to Special Court (Customs, Taxation and Anti-Smugg­ling-II), Accountability Court-III Hyderabad to Ban­king Court Mirpur Khas, Accountability Court-III Sukkur to Banking Court Ghotki, and Accountability Court-IV Sukkur to Banking Court Shaheed Benazirabad.
The cabinet also authorised the Special Court-II (Anti-Terrorism) to hear cases under the Official Secrets Act 1923.
The cabinet also approved signing a memorandum of understanding between the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, and the Qatar government regarding labour relations, inspections, and occupational safety and health. It was informed that currently, 300,000 Pakistanis were working in Qatar, who were sending foreign exchange worth Rs850 million to Pakistan.
The cabinet also approved the Federal Public Private Policy of Pakistan 2023-2028 on the recommendation of the Ministry of Planning and Special Initiatives. In this regard, the prime minister directed all the ministries to submit their proposals. The cabinet endorsed the decisions taken in its meeting held on April 4.
Chinese delegation
In a separate meeting with a delegation of Shanghai Electric Group led by Chairman Wu Lei, the PM assured him that the government would make no compromise on the security of Chinese workers in Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz said that the government would ensure all possible facilitation of Chinese investors to expand the ongoing projects. He urged the Chinese firms to convert power plants from imported to local coal and increase their investment in the coal mining sector.
The Shanghai Electric Group is currently working on the Thar coal mine development and a 1320MW coal power project. “The Thar coal projects executed by the group are annually saving around $400 million,” said a press release.
Development of Balochistan
In a meeting with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, the prime minister said that the development of the province was among the top priorities of the federal government. He expressed deep grief over the rain-related losses and assured that the federal government would “support the provincial government in the rehabilitation of the affected people”.
PM Shehbaz maintained that the federal government would also support the provincial government in the education sector. He added the network of Daanish schools was being expanded to the province.

2,7 militants killed trying to cross Afghan border: ISPR,PESHAWAR: At least seven militants were killed in North Waziristan as security forces foiled a bid by them to enter...,"PESHAWAR: At least seven militants were killed in North Waziristan as security forces foiled a bid by them to enter Pakistan from Afghanis­tan, said the army’s media wing on Wednesday.
Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that a large quantity of arms and ammunition was also recovered from the militants by security forces following an intense exchan­­ge of fire in the Spinkai area of the district.
The statement said that the militants gunned down during the exchange of fire were trying to infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, but their movement was detected by the troops in the Ghulam Khan area.
“The infiltrators were surrounded, effectively engaged and after an intense fire exchange, all seven terrorists were killed. A large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered from the killed terrorists,” it read.
The statement said that Pakistan had consistently been asking the interim Afghan government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border to prevent the movement of militants entering Pakistan to foment terrorism.
“[The] interim Afghan government is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by terrorists for perpetuating acts of terrorism aga­inst Pakistan,” the state­­ment said.

3,Controversy over lawmaker’s ‘mistaken identity’ lands before top court,"JUI-F claims Sadaf Ihsan ""impersonated"" its actual candidate Sadaf Yasmin; assails PHC order after her notification by ECP.","ISLAMABAD: A controversy over what apparently started as an internal dispute between a political party and one of its workers spilled over into the country’s highest court with a plea that someone it had not fielded as its candidate has managed to win the slot, allegedly through impersonation.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) moved the Supreme Court against the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) April 2 order which had led the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to reinstate Sadaf Ihsan as a member of the National Assembly.
Sadaf Ihsan is accused of stealing identity and impersonating another candidate actually fielded by the JUI-F on a reserved seat for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It may be recalled that the ECP had earlier withdrawn the victory notification after the JUI-F disowned Sadaf Ihsan being a member of the party.

JUI-F claims Sadaf Ihsan ‘impersonated’ its actual candidate Sadaf Yasmin; assails PHC order after her notification by ECP

Moved through senior counsel Kamran Murtaza, the petition explained that JUI-F had submitted with the ECP separate lists of its candidates in order of priority for seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.
The petition pleaded that a list was furnished to the ECP containing all required details for three candidates, including Hina Bibi (Respondent 6). However, to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin — the original candidate whom Sadaf Ihsan apparently impersonated — only her name was added to the list because other details had not been conveyed by her to the party.
According to the petition, prior to the issuance of the notification of returned candidate, the ECP ought to have either rejected the list to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin or sought clarification from the party whether Sadaf Ihsan was Sadaf Yasmin or not.
The petition contended that the JUI-F informed Hina Bibi that Sadaf Yasmin had not submitted her nomination papers as she was living with her family in Karachi, and she had rather decided not to avail of the opportunity. Thus Hina Bibi should have been considered the third validly nominated candidate of the JUI–F.
At the time of submission of nomination papers, Sadaf Ihsan with the probable collusion of someone within the party — who knew that Sadaf Yasmin was not pursuing her nomination — decided to portray herself as Sadaf Yasmin, since her first name was identical.
Initially, the ECP issued a notification on Feb 22, in which two of the 10 seats were given, one to PML-N and the other to JUI-F. Both the returned candidates of these parties were the top priority candidates.
But after the Sunni Ittehad Council’s claim for allocation of reserved seats was decided against them, the ECP issued another notification on March 4, for the remaining eight seats for women from KP in which Naeema Kishwar, who was second in priority list of the JUI-F, was listed as the returned candidate of the party.
Hina Bibi filed an application on March 6 to the ECP while the JUI-F also filed an application against the March 4 notification.
Subsequently, the ECP issued a notification on March 11 suspending the notification to the extent of Sadaf Ihsan and also published a press release on March 12, citing that it had initiated an inquiry and will hear all the parties concerned before deciding the matter.
The press release also stated that the Returning Officer had been suspended as he should not have accepted Sadaf Ihsan as the JUI-F’s candidate.
Fearing the outcome of the hearing before the ECP, Sadaf Ihsan challenged the March 11 notification before the PHC without making the JUI-F a party in the petition, the JUI-F regretted.
Consequently, on April 2, a division bench of the PHC allowed Sadaf Ihsan’s petition.
The JUI-F emphasised that it was purely the prerogative of political parties to decide the candidature for the reserved seats of women in order of priority under Article 51(e) of the Constitution, Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 and Chapter VI of Elections Rules 2017.
The ECP can recall or amend a notification issued under Article 51 of the Constitution, read with Section 104 of Elections Act 2017 for reserved NA seats for women, if an impersonator has managed to get a reserved seat due to negligence of the Returning Officer, the petition said.
A political party and the rightful candidate cannot be deprived of a seat due to negligence on part of an ECP official, the petition bemoaned, adding that the claim of Sadaf Ihsan on the seat was a privilege granted by the party. Thus Sadaf Ihsan cannot claim rights on a seat before the PHC by going against the stance of her own party about her being an impersonator and her having no right to enforce for a reserved seat not meant for her, the petition emphasised.

4,Aurangzeb pledges aggressive reforms at IMF meeting,"Assures lender of broadening tax net, privatising SOEs, expanding social safety nets, facilitating private sector.","WASHINGTON: In a meeting with the IMF chief and some members of its board of governors, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to carry out “aggressive reforms” to stabilise its economy.
These discussions were part of a meeting of Middle East and North Africa (MENAP) ministers and governors with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva held on Tuesday.
Mr Aurangzeb “underscored aggressive reforms, including broadening the tax net, privatising loss-making SOEs, expanding social safety nets and facilitating the private sector,” his team said in a statement issued a day after the meeting.
The minister underscored the implications of geo-economic fragmentation on Pakistan and expressed gratitude to the IMF, multilateral development banks, and “time-tested sincere bilateral partners” for their unwavering support during these trying times.
He stressed the significance of reallocating a nation’s special drawing rights (SDRs) within the IMF to tackle economic hurdles effectively. Additionally, he highlighted the necessity of reassessing surcharge policies and giving precedence to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to address climate vulnerabilities.

Assures lender of broadening tax net, privatising SOEs, expanding social safety nets, facilitating private sector

The IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) has been in operation for more than a year, with the initial 17 countries securing commitments of financial assistance. Pakistan, identified as a low emitter yet severely impacted by climate change, is also seeking aid from this fund.
Advocating for a more proactive and responsive Global Financial Safety Net to address heightened risks, the minister applauded the IMF’s renewed focus on Capacity Building through Regional Capacity Development Centres (RCDCs).
The minister advocated for a proactive global financial safety net to address heightened risks and appreciated the IMF’s renewed emphasis on capacity-building through regional capacity development centres. He also stressed the importance of collaborative efforts for sustainable economic development.
Pakistan, in pursuit of another long-term package — its 24th thus far — from the IMF, has formulated a comprehensive economic recovery plan. This plan encompasses three primary components: taxation, energy, and streamlining the privatisation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including PIA.
The IMF board is scheduled to convene on April 29 to deliberate on releasing the final tranche of its current programme with Pakistan. Subsequently, discussions between IMF staff and Islamabad regarding the new package are anticipated to commence.
During Tuesday’s meeting, the IMF acknowledged Pakistan’s progress in meeting its conditions, while Pakistani officials advocated for a new plan tailored more specifically to Pakistan’s needs.
Later, at a JP Morgan Seminar on Pakistan’s Economic Policy Outlook, Mr Aurangzeb emphasised positive economic indicators such as the robust performance of the agriculture sector, decreasing inflationary pressures, a stable exchange rate, shrinking trade deficit, and robust remittance inflows.
He informed the participants that Pakistan was committed to engaging in a broader and extended programme with the IMF.
At a meeting with Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank Group, the minister emphasised Pakistan’s advancements under the nine-month SBA programme and the ongoing reforms in key sectors such as taxation, energy and privatisation.
Both parties acknowledged the necessity of establishing a 10-year rolling Country Framework Plan.
The World Bank president pledged his complete support for Pakistan’s reform initiatives and digitalisation efforts aimed at stabilising the economy and boosting revenues. Additionally, the minister extended an invitation for the president to visit Pakistan.

• Stories of trapped citizens, damage to property emerge as death toll hits 19
• Dubai airport struggles to cope amid delays, diversions
DUBAI: Two days on, highways in the UAE remained inundated and its major airport in chaos as the Middle East’s financial centre was gridlocked on Wednesday.
Storms hit the Emirates and Bahrain overnight Monday and on Tuesday, after lashing Oman, where 18 people were killed including children.
Police in the UAE said at least one 70-year-old man was killed after he was swept away in his car in Ras Al-Khaimah, one of the oil-rich country’s seven emirates. Power outages were reported in and around Dubai, which was dotted with flooded areas and submerged and abandoned cars.
One road tunnel near the airport was completely flooded to a depth of several metres.
Climatologist Friederike Otto, a specialist in assessing the role of climate change on extreme weather events, stated it was “highly likely” that global warming had worsened the storms.
The UAE also frequently conducts cloud seeding operations to increase rainfall. Bloomberg had said earlier that seven cloud seeding operations had occurred in the days before the storm.
Responding to reports of the UAE carrying out cloud seeding (spraying chemicals to increase rainfall), a senior weather forecaster at the Gulf state’s National Centre of Meteorology issued a clarification saying, “We did not use cloud seeding because (the storm) was already strong.”
The UAE saw record rainfall with 254mm falling in less than 24 hours in Al Ain, a city on the UAE-Oman border, according to the national meteorology centre.
That was the most since records began in 1949, before the UAE was formed in 1971. Long lines of vehicles along the waterlogged, six-lane expressways were witnessed, after the 259.5mm of rain.
Emergency response
As sunny skies returned, stories emerged of residents stuck in cars and offices overnight after torrential downpours and rolling black clouds.
Local media and social media posts showed significant damage across the country, including collapsed roads and flooded homes. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear as emergency workers sought to drain flooded roads across the country hours after the heavy rain subsided.
The UAE lacks much of the needed drainage infrastructure to handle heavy rain. It is not uncommon for roads to become partially submerged by water during extended periods of rainfall. It typically rains only a few times a year.
Iranian authorities said they rescued 21 Sri Lankan crewmen from a Cook Islands-flagged tanker sinking in the Gulf of Oman, the state news agency IRNA reported. The unnamed tanker suffered damage approximately 50km off the coast of Jask in Iran, the report said. Five of the crewmen received medical care from Jask emergency services and were in good physical condition. However, it did not say when the rescue took place.
International travel
 

Passengers queue at a flight desk at the Dubai International Airport, on Wednesday.—AFP

Dubai International, the hub of Emirates Airline, said it was experiencing significant disruptions with flights delayed or diverted due to heavy rains. The airport had briefly suspended operations on Tuesday as the rains caused flooding across Dubai and elsewhere in the UAE.
Dubai’s flagship Emirates airline cancelled all check-ins as staff and passengers struggled to arrive and leave, with access roads flooded and some metro services suspended. At the airport, long taxi queues formed and passengers milled around, many growing increasingly frustrated as nearly every departure was repeatedly delayed.
“They are completely lost, its complete chaos — no information, nothing,” fumed one passenger, who did not want to be named, after a 12-hour wait.
Meanwhile, a large crowd gathered at a connections desk, clapping and whistling in protest at the lack of information.
Scores of flights were delayed, cancelled and diverted during Tuesday’s torrential rain.
Dubai International Airport said it was working to restore normal operations as quickly as possible, but added that the recovery would take some time.
Flights have been delayed/diverted and impacted by displaced crew, DXB said in a statement. The airport, the world’s busiest in terms of international flights and a major transit hub, advised passengers in Dubai not to come to the airport, in a post on social media.
Emirates Airline said passengers arriving to Dubai and already in transit would continue to be processed.
Separately, Egypt Air issued a statement notifying those concerned about the suspension of their flight operations between Cairo and Dubai. The airline said flights on this route will remain suspended until weather conditions in the UAE improve.
