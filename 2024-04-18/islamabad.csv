In an unconventional diplomatic event, the Embassy of France hosted a gathering to honor these companies for their efforts, highlighting the pivotal role of the private sector in addressing societal issues.
In his remarks, the Ambassador of France Nicolas Galey informed his guests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) had evolved beyond mere financial contributions to societal welfare. 
It encompassed a commitment to values and principles, including gender equality, support for disadvantaged groups, and community development.
“French companies operating in Pakistan have been at the forefront of this movement, recognising that their interests are intertwined with the well-being of the society,” he said.
The event showcased the contributions of four prominent French companies – L’Oréal, Schneider, IPSOS, and Servier – through a series of inspiring videos. These companies had integrated CSR into their operations, not only for the benefit of society but also for the betterment of their employees and business performance.
Ambassador Galey emphasised the alignment of private and public interests in promoting societal development.
He underlined the importance of initiatives like the one being celebrated, which demonstrated the convergence of interests between the public and private sectors.
Guests were informed that the commitment of French companies to women’s empowerment aligned with France’s foreign policy priorities, including its ambitious “feminist diplomacy”.

Recent legislation in France mandated the consideration of social and environmental issues in corporate management, reflecting a broader global shift towards sustainability.
Nicolas Galey highlighted that the economic presence of French companies in Pakistan, with 20 subsidiaries and 2 billion Euros of investments, not only contributed to the country’s economy but also to its social development.
Even during challenging times, such as the floods of 2022, French companies exhibited solidarity by supporting local communities directly or through funding NGOs.
Ambassador Galey commended the participating companies for their long-term commitment to Pakistan’s development. Despite economic challenges, these companies continued to invest in human capital and foster inclusive work environments that empower both men and women.

3,‘Judges in subordinate judiciary are working independently’,District bar president dismisses suspicion of external influence on their work.,"ISLAMABAD: The judges of the subordinate judiciary are working independently and without any pressure, President District Bar Association Islamabad Raja Shakeel Abbasi said on Wednesday.
Talking to mediapersons, Mr Abbasi said judges of the district courts were presiding in their respective courts independently and in accordance with law.
“Being president of the bar association, I remain in touch with the judges; I also get input from fellow lawyers, and I never received a complaint against a judge that he is working under the direction of any intelligence agency,” he added.
In case a judge feels any interruption in his judicial work, he can send a complaint to his senior authority or raise this issue at an appropriate forum, he added.

District bar president dismisses suspicion of external influence on their work

It may be mentioned that the six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) divulged in a letter sent to the Supreme Judicial Council that a sessions judge had been threatened, but instead of conducting a probe, the administration repatriated him to his parent department, Lahore High Court, and he is now posted in Bahawalpur.
Sources privy to the development said the IHC administration contacted the sessions judge to know the details about the intimidation. However, the judge responded in writing and did not raise this matter with the administration. Instead he stated that the junior judges had also been instructed not to allow any outsider in their respective chambers.
The sources said the judge was transferred because a party in a high-profile murder case lodged a complaint against the verdict for his leniency towards the accused persons.
Another sessions judge transferred during this period was one whose house was robbed, and the thieves took Rs5.5 million, $15,000 and gold ornaments.
A senior official of the sessions court told Dawn that there were at least four remedies available for the judicial officer in case someone tried to influence him or her.
He said that the judge of the sessions court can write to the registrar and the second remedy is the Member Inspection Team (MIT) at the high court level, where a serving sessions judge deals with complaints related to district judiciary.
The third remedy is to approach the inspection judge, who is a serving judge of the high court. There are three inspection judges in the IHC to oversee the special courts and East and West Sessions Divisions of the federal capital.
He, however, said not a single application or complaint was sent to the sessions judges or the IHC.
The district bar president said there was a possibility that certain quarters might secretly approach a judge, but this could not be done without the consent of the said judge.
In case a judge gives them a cold shoulder, such elements never dare approach them again, he added.

7,CDA fails to reap full benefit of two mega road projects,"Officials say roads to be opened to heavy traffic soon, cite traffic management issues behind delay","ISLAMABAD: The reluctance of the authorities to allow heavy traffic on two key roads – the 5km-long Bhara Kahu bypass and Karnal Sher Khan Avenue (formerly I.J.P Road) – despite spending billions of rupees on these projects has resulted in a question mark on the reliability of these projects.
These projects were executed by the National Logistic Cell (NLC) and inaugurated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his first tenure last year. The bypass has proved a blessing for commuters who can now skirt the traffic mess in Bhara Kahu, particularly during summer and special occasions. But to reap the maximum benefits of this project, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) needs to allow the heavy traffic on this road.
“Billions of rupees were spent on this project, but we cannot understand why it is not opened for heavy vehicles; is the CDA afraid of extra load,” asked Luqman Khan, a driver.
This project was completed in 10 months as the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government wanted to complete it during its tenure. The original cost of the project was Rs6.5 billion, but the scope of the project was expanded which resulted in an increase in its cost. Recently, the CDA board was told that the NLC had moved a bill of Rs1.8 billion against the additional work.

Officials say roads to be opened to heavy traffic soon, cite traffic management issues behind delay

The CDA had referred the bill to the consultant firm of the Punjab government, which endorsed the additional work and recommended the approval of Rs1.3 billion. The board after approving the recommendation directed the engineering wing to place the issue before the CDA’s Development Working Party (DWP) for the final approval.
Like the bypass road, the overhauling and expansion project of the 8.5-kilometre-long I.J.P. Road cost Rs5 billion. It has two major flyovers – one near Sabzi Mandi and the second in front of 9th Avenue. Sabzi Mandi flyover is closed for heavy traffic whereas the flyover next to the 9th Avenue has developed rutting due to the load of heavy traffic vehicles.
According to the CDA officials, the Bhara Kahu bypass and the I.J.P. flyover would be opened for heavy traffic “soon after the resolution of the traffic management issues”.
They said that due to “technical” reasons heavy traffic was not allowed on these roads at present.
The officials said the flyover on the I.J.P. Road was opened for traffic but it was later closed due to a fear of road accidents. They said the heavy vehicle moving on a rigid lane could not change lanes after crossing the flyover due to the traffic mess outside the nearest bus stand. The CDA member engineering visited the site recently and asked the officials concerned to resolve the issue of traffic management.
Speaking about the Bhara Kahu bypass, the officials said the contractor NLC was directed to take necessary measures after the recommendation of the consultant. The officials claimed the bypass road would be opened for the heavy traffic as soon as possible.
To a query, about rutting on the 9th Avenue flyover, the official said that it was being repaired and initial work had been done. “When the temperature will increase up to 30 degrees Celsius, asphalt will be laid on it since the procedure is not recommended during rainy days as per the standards engineering protocols, he claimed.
CDA spokesperson Nauman Khalid said that the authority was aware of both issues and the engineering wing had already been directed to get the bypass and the flyover in question opened for heavy traffic after resolving the traffic management issue. “The contractor of the bypass road has already started working for the traffic management while a way forward is being finalised for the flyover as well for the ease of the motorists,” he said.

9,Plan to outsource Pims radiology department opposed,"Staffers believe it will impact patients, term department ‘jewel in crown’.","ISLAMABAD: While the health ministry has been considering outsourcing the radiology department of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), the hospital employees believe patients will face the brunt of this decision.
They have pinned their hopes on the newly-appointed coordinator to the Prime Minister on National Health Services (MHS) Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath and a draft has been prepared to share the factual position with him.
According to the draft, even though 90 per cent of the services were free the department earned Rs5 million which went to the national exchequer. Moreover, the draft termed the department a “jewel in the crown”.
According to documents available with Dawn, the ministry has been considering outsourcing the diagnostic unit of Pims.

Staffers believe it will impact patients, term department ‘jewel in crown’

As per the draft, the radiology department provides services to 500,000 patients a year through the latest equipment which includes a 1.5T MRI by Siemens (2023), 128 slice CT scanner by Canon (2021), mammography machines by Hologic and Helianthus, ultrasound machines, and digital X-ray machines.
These data are integrated and stored by the latest picture archiving system (PACs) from Boston with servers capable of over five years of data storage.
“The radiology department comprises 12 fellow consultants comprising a professor, two associate professors, three assistant professors, five senior registrars, and a senior consultant headed by Prof Ayesha Isani Majeed (Fellow of the Royal College of Radiologists, UK and PhD public health), 30 postgraduate students (FCPS and MD with a number of them in the dual process of sitting for the FRCR), and 40 paramedical and support staff,” it stated.
Breakdown of patients
In 2023, the total number of X-rays performed was 247,745; out of which, 90.8pc were free. The total number of ultrasounds performed was 58,133; out of which, 97.6pc were free. The total number of Doppler’s performed was 2,975; out of which, 95pc were free. The total number of CT scans performed was 51,441; out of which, 98.8pc were free. Similarly, over 80pc of MRI were provided free of cost.
Even though less than 5pc patients charged for the radiological services paid nominal amounts the department still made Rs5m. The hospital charges only Rs70 for the X-ray, Rs200 for ultrasound, Rs300 for Doppler, Rs2,500 for a brain CT scan, Rs3,000 each for HRCT Chest, CT Abdomen, and Rs4,000 for MRI.
The letter also provided a comparison with the private sector. For instance, private health facilities charge Rs1,000 for the X-ray, Rs 3150 for the ultrasound, Rs5,000 for Doppler, Rs6,450 for a CT scan of the brain and Rs 9,450 each for HRCT Chest, CT Abdomen and MRI.
“However, despite the subsidy the department has earned Rs 5 million for the government of Pakistan which goes into the exchequer and if a viable financial model is made the amount earned by the radiology department at Pims can contribute towards the budget of the hospital for its upkeep and renovation,” said the document.
According to the draft, the Radiology department conducts multidisciplinary meetings where oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, and Gynae among others for the best outcome for the patients which is decided by consensus of all speciality experts.
“Multiple research projects on artificial intelligence on chest X-rays and mammography are underway. Similarly, breast cancer genetics, tuberculosis, HIV research have been conducted through grants and different academic platforms with multiple publications in international and national journals,” it stated.
“The first ever holistic breast cancer screening centre of the public sector has been established. Similarly, paediatric imaging facilities are provided at the children’s hospital, Pims, and maternal and fetal imaging facilities at Maternal and Child Hospital. The department performs X-ray chest around the clock for the burn centre,” it stated.
Health coordinator visits NEOC
Meanwhile, Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath, accompanied by Health Secretary Nadeem Mahboob, visited the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) for Polio Eradication to review the progress of anti-polio efforts.
According to NEOC Coordinator Dr Shahzad Baig, “We have set two goals for this year. First, to interrupt transmission of the local YB3C poliovirus genetic cluster, by the middle of this year, and the second is to close all outbreaks of the imported YB3A virus and interrupt its transmission by the end of this year.”
“Since last year, we have implemented an intense vaccination schedule which we will continue this year to ensure children have high immunity against polio infection,” he added.
