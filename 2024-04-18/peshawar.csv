0,KP PDMA asks district admins to monitor melting glaciers,"Warns public life, property, infrastructure vulnerable to Glofs in nine cities.","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued an advisory warning the administrations of nine districts in the province about the vulnerability of people’s lives, property, crops, and infrastructure to glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs).
It asked them to regularly monitor glaciers in their respective areas, including Upper and Lower Chitral, Swat, Upper and Lower Dir, Upper and Lower Kohistan, Mansehra, and Kurram districts.
“Since the global climate change phenomenon is real, there is a high risk posed by these glaciers in the event of Glofs, which may cause damage to lives, property, crops, infrastructure, and livelihoods. It is of paramount importance that these glaciers be regularly monitored by field staff through close coordination with local communities to report any event with reference to glacial lake formation, glacier rapid melting, glacial advances, Glofs or any hazard related to Glofs and glaciers,” the PDMA said in the advisory.
It said that the Pakistan Meteorological Department had intimated it about the possibility of another weather system hitting the country between April 23 and April 29.

Warns public life, property, infrastructure vulnerable to Glofs in nine cities

The PDMA said it was imperative to regularly monitor glaciers in those districts through field staff.
It said an advisory shared with it by the National Disaster Management Authority declared that in light of the forthcoming weather system, temperature gradients across the country could cause strong winds, dust storms, thunderstorms, and hailstorms.
“The increased temperature and rainfall in northern Pakistan, especially in mountainous areas of KP, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, may lead to avalanches in at-risk, vulnerable snowbound valleys,” it said.
The disaster management body said that in light of increased temperatures across the northern part of the country, there was a risk of Glof incidents in the vulnerable valleys of KP, GB, and AJK.
“Increased rainfall in the northern half of Pakistan and Balochistan, including districts of KP, northern and central Punjab, GB and AJK may lead to flash flooding and landslides in vulnerable and at-risk mountainous and hilly areas,” it said.
The PDMA said irrigation water would be required at regular intervals for season vegetables and newly-sown kharif crops.
During the last three days, rains battered the province killing 36 people, injuring scores and damaging standing crops.
They also played havoc with the infrastructure leading to the suspension of traffic in several districts.
EARLY HELP ORDERED: On the orders of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a process has been “geared up” to provide financial assistance to the families of the people, who lost lives in various rain-related incidents, according to a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.
It said that Rs50 million had been released by the PDMA as financial assistance to the heirs of the deceased in various districts.
The CM’s Secretariat said that Rs20 million had been released for Nowshera district, Rs5 million for Lower Dir, Rs3 million each for Swat and Malakand, Rs2 million each for Upper Dir and Tank, and Rs1 million each had been released for Lower Chitral, Battagram, Karak, Peshawar, and Charsadda.
It added that Rs10 million had also been released for general relief in Lower Chitral.
Expressing satisfaction with the steps taken by the PDMA and other relevant departments in providing relief to the rain-affected families, the chief minister said the provincial government would not leave the victims of natural calamities alone.
“Providing immediate relief to them is the first priority of the provincial government, and all available resources are being utilised for this purpose,” he said.
The CM directed authorities to carefully assess the damages in all affected districts and ensure that all the victims are provided with relief and assistance.
He ordered speedy work on the rehabilitation of rain-hit infrastructure and said the issues faced by people could be resolved as soon as possible and they could return to their normal lives.
“Nothing can replace a human life. However, the provincial government not only equally shares the grief of the bereaved families, but it is also going all-out to provide them relief and assistance,” he said.

1,"Landslide buries four houses, mosque in Chitral",Affected families shifted to nearby government primary school building.,"CHITRAL/SHANGLA: A landslide buried four houses and a mosque and shook the foundations of 18 other houses in Azurdam Sheshi village of Drosh town, rendering the families homeless on Wednesday morning.
Mujahid Khan, a social worker in the village, told Dawn that the affected families were shifted to a nearby government primary school building.
He said ration was being provided to the families, while Al-Khidmat Foundation, a charity of Jamaat-i-Islami, had also erected a number of tents on the premises of the school to house the families.
Lower Chitral deputy commissioner Mohammad Imran Khan told Dawn that rescue teams led by the assistant commissioner were dispatched to the affected village soon after the incident was reported.
He said rescue teams also shifted the cattle of the affected families to safer places.
He said Booni Road had been reopened for traffic on Wednesday, while work was in progress to reopen the Garam Chashma and Kalash valleys roads.
Meanwhile, in Shangla, the district administration on Wednesday evacuated the inmates of 19 houses in Karora area of Chakesar tehsil to safer places for fear of landslides.
The administration provided them with tents and other essential items.
The administration said upper parts of the district had been affected by rainfall, which lashed the region for five straight days, triggering landslides.
A police official said Karora-Chakesar Road got blocked near Karora after a heavy landslide struck it on Wednesday afternoon, stranding passengers.
Shangla deputy commissioner Ziaur Rehman said inmates were evacuated from their houses for fear of landslides.
He said tehsil municipal administration, Chakesar, had started removing landslides from the road.
The DC said an excavator machine had been sent to Pagorai area, where nine houses were at risk of being hit by landslide.

He said the Bisham-Swat Road had also been reopened to light traffic.
Travellers said debris of landslide was still lying on the main road as the National Highway Authority did not send the road clearance machinery there.
The district administration said the downpour caused death of two people, three injuries and damaged 25 houses in Shangla.

2,Governor voices concern over long delay in regular VCs’ appointment,"He also asks govt to address financial, administrative issues of universities","PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Ghulam Ali has expressed concern about the functioning of the province’s 24 public sector universities without the regular vice-chancellors and the long delay in filling those top vacancies.
“The absence of regular vice chancellors in many public sector universities within the province contributes to the decline in higher education quality, necessitating immediate attention,” the governor told the chief minister in a letter.
In the letter, the governor, who is also the chancellor of government universities in the province, said stakeholders had identified shortcomings in various provisions of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Sector Universities Act, 2012.
“These shortcomings should be taken up with authorities for necessary changes to the law,” he said.
Mr Ali said the governor’s secretariat had compiled a report on the state of public sector universities in the province, highlighting flaws in higher education policies and proposing solutions.

He also asks govt to address financial, administrative issues of universities

He said the report called for the resolution of the financial and administrative crises at the universities.
The governor said the universities should“rationalise budgets, mitigate budget deficits, and channelise energies for quality education and research aligned with market demands.”
Currently, the province’s 24 government universities are functioning without regular VCs. The VC position has been vacant at eight universities for the last one year, according to officials.
They told Dawn that those eight universities included Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan, Khushhal Khan Khattak University Karak, University of Agriculture Dera Ismail Khan, University of Lakki Marwat, Hazara University Mansehra, University of Engineering and Technology Mardan, and Women University Swabi.
Seven other universities have been awaiting the filling of the top position for three months. They include Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Bacha Khan University Charsadda, Shuhada-i-APS University of Technology Nowshera, Kohat University of Science and Technology, University of Peshawar, University of Science and Technology Bannu, and University of Engineering Peshawar.
Officials said five universities, including Fata University Dara Adamkhel, Islamia College University Peshawar, the University of Buner and the University of Chitral had been functioning without regular VCs for the last one month.
The newly-established University of Agriculture Swat, University of Engineering and Applied Sciences Swat, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Swat, and University of Shangla also don’t have regular VCs.
Sources in the higher education department claimed that the process for appointing regular VCs to public sector universities in the province was completed three months ago, but the provincial government was reluctant to notify the names of VCs “without any justification.”
These vacancies were advertised during the last Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government, with Mahmood Khan being the chief minister, according to them.
The sources said the academic search committee for the appointment of vice-chancellors conducted interviews for VC posts from January 22 to January 26.
They, however, said the provincial government insisted the process of appointing VCs had been completed during the time of the caretaker government, which had no authority to appoint VCs.
The sources said the current elected government intended to re-advertise all those positions.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Higher Education Commission has written a letter to the secretary of the higher education department in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa about the issue.
“The development of higher educational institutions hinges, among other things, on the quality and continuity of their leadership. Discontinuity and ad hoc arrangements, on the other hand, cause inconsistencies in work, gaps in policy implementation, and financial indiscipline, resulting in inefficiency, poor governance, and weak institutional performance. Unfortunately, the situation in KP is serious as there are many public sector universities with the offices of VCs either vacant or being overseen by individuals on an acting basis,” he said.
The HEC chairman pushed the higher education secretary to ensure the early filling of the top vacancies in universities.

6,Jamrud police accused of kidnapping teenager for ransom,Attaullah Afridi says his son Khubaan had gone to Karkhano Market for Eid shopping and was picked up by local police.,"KHYBER: A resident of Jamrud has accused Khyber police of abducting his teenage son for ransom and demanded his immediate recovery.
Addressing a press conference at Jamrud Press Club on Wednesday, Attaullah Afridi said that his son Khubaan had gone to Karkhano Market for Eid shopping and was picked up by local police.
He alleged that police official Suhail had since been demanding ransom from his family. He said that the official first approached his other son and then shifted his abducted son to an undisclosed location.
Mr Afridi said that his son was innocent and no case was registered against him at any police station. He added that other police officials were expressing ignorance about the ‘arrest’ of his son in any criminal act.
He said that that he also approached the district police officer, who promised to help in early recovery of his missing son but to no avail. He alleged that Khyber police had becoming an organised gang of kidnappers. He appealed to inspector general of police to take notice of the issue and help in recovery of his son from police.
Responding to the accusations of Attaullah Afridi, spokesman for police Zaheer Khan said that police were neither aware of the kidnapping of the boy, nor had his parents lodged an FIR in that regard.
He told Dawn that other law enforcement agencies were also operating in Khyber that might have picked up Khubaan for his alleged involvement in any criminal case. He said that the father of the missing boy should approach proper forum instead of raising the issue in the press.
Meanwhile, scrap dealers in Jamrud have resented crackdown on their shops and demanded immediate reopening of all their closed shops.
Samar Gul, a scrap dealer, told journalists in Jamrud that their shops were forcibly closed by police over suspicion of illegal business two months ago without any prior notice.
He said that they were only dealing in used iron and steel items to earn a meagre amount. He said all their pleadings about their innocence and financial miseries had so far fallen on deaf ears.
Mr Gul demanded of the DPO and officials of district administration to look into the matter and order opening of their shops.

The deputy commissioner also accompanied the CM’s aide.

The inquiry committee has been tasked to dig out facts, identify other loopholes in the hospital management and submit a detailed report within three days.
BANNED: Lakki deputy commissioner Rahamat Ali Wazir has banned the sale, purchase and stock of pocket guides and other material for a period of three weeks in order to ensure the cheating-free conduct of the secondary school certificate examinations.

8,"PHC again seeks response of govt, PTA to plea against X restrictions","Lawyer says ‘systematic disruptions, blocking’ of social media platform is unconstitutional","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday directed the federal government and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) yet again to respond to a petition against restrictions on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in the country.
When a bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali took up the petition for hearing, it was informed that the respondents had so far not submitted their comments about the case.
On March 21, a high court bench issued notices to the respondents, including the federal government and the PTA, seeking their response to the petition.
The bench was hearing the petition filed by lawyer Nouman Muhib Kakakhel, who requested it to declare that the ‘systematic disruptions and blocking’ of X service is unconstitutional and a violation of the fundamental and legal rights of the people at large, including him.

Lawyer says ‘systematic disruptions, blocking’ of social media platform is unconstitutional

He requested the court to order the complete restoration of X service in the country.
The petitioner also sought interim relief through orders for authorities to restore X service until the disposal of his petition.
The respondents in the petition are the federal government through the secretary of the Cabinet Division, the secretary of the ministry of information technology and telecommunication, and the PTA through its chairman.
Mr Kakakhel said X was a social media micro-blogging platform used by public personalities, journalists, multinational companies, government departments, officials, and the public at large in the country to express their views, make announcements, and share ideas, and that restrictions on it were unconstitutional and unlawful.
He added that X was also a source of news, entertainment, a marketing tool for businesses, and an opportunity to connect and converse on various topics as a global community.
The petitioner pointed out that the telecom regulator PTA neither issued any notification about the systematic disruptions and blocking of X service in the country nor did it specify any reason for it.
He said the country’s population mostly consisted of youth, who depended on information technology for learning, information, and livelihoods due to a lack of resources.
The petitioner contended that the media - the fourth pillar of the state - was powerful and effective like others, including the executive, judiciary, and legislature, as it helped form public opinions by providing the latest information to the people.
He claimed that social media had taken over a lion’s share of the space previously occupied by the traditional media and provided the people with an opportunity to express their opinions about every national issue.
Mr Kakakhel contended that if ‘miscreants’ misused social media platforms in the country, they could be taken to task by the Federal Investigation Agency’s Cyber-Crime Wing and other authorities, but blocking access of the entire population to the social media platform was unjustified and against the law.
He said the country had various laws under which those acting against national security or the interests of the state, judiciary, or any national institution could be charged and punished in accordance with the law.

9,"Khyber admin, TMA lock horns over temple controversy",Work on plaza halted two days before Eid,"KHYBER: The district administration and tehsil municipal administration (TMA) have locked horns over construction of a commercial building at the site of a temple in Landi Kotal bazaar.
Both sides express ignorance about any mention of Hindus’ worship place at the site in revenue record.
However, construction of the building was temporarily halted only two days before Eidul Fitr when the TMA authorities served notices on the builders and contractor, asking for documentary proof of the ownership of the disputed site.
Officials told Dawn that no proof of the ownership was produced to them.
Relevant officials of district administration and TMA with whom this scribe interacted to ascertain the raison d’etre behind the secret demolition of the temple and construction of a commercial building at the disputed site, tried to pass the buck to each other.

Work on plaza halted two days before Eid

They also accused each other of bypassing or ignoring the legal procedure for issuing of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for construction of a new building or repair of the old one in Landi Kotal bazaar.
The subordinate staff of the assistant commissioner (AC) of Landi Kotal, however, conceded during their conversation with Dawn that they had received an application from two locals -- Ismail Khan and Zabeehullah -- on March 22 for an NOC regarding repair of two dilapidated shops at Paagal Naach street of the bazaar.
“We duly forwarded the application to the TMA office for approval of NOC prior to checking revenue record about ownership of the site but did not receive any response from them,” they said.
However, they failed to respond to a query about how the construction of the commercial building had started when TMA had not responded to their request about the revenue record and spot visit by the relevant staff.
Officials said that the AC office could not issue an NOC until TMA gave its approval after checking of revenue record. They added that TMA was the sole approving authority for such activities.
On the other hand, they said that the application for grant of NOC was submitted to the AC office on a back date whereas they received the request for approval only on April 8 when the construction of the building was already started and any trace of the historic temple was eliminated.
Tehsil chairman Shah Khalid told Dawn that the two builders approached them after TMA received a request from the AC office regarding ascertaining of the revenue record. He said that the builders insisted that the disputed site was their joint property but they could not produce and documentary proof to that effect.
He said that TMA demanded of the AC office to hand it over the entire ‘file’ of the construction of new building as NOC was sought only for repair of two old shops. “We see and apprehend some under table deal as no proper regulations were followed with TMA being ignored in the initial application for grant of NOC,” he added.
Shopkeepers in Landi Kotal bazaar having shops adjacent to the disputed site confirmed the existence of an old temple, though in a dilapidated condition and closed since the migration of Hindus from the area at the time of partition of India.
Requesting anonymity, they said that the remaining structure of the old temple was demolished in the darkness of night to pave the way for construction of a plaza.
Local Christians also expressed reservations about the demolition of the temple and demanded of authorities to safeguard places of worship of minorities and take them into confidence about any change in the existing structure of such buildings.

10,Rescue centre for Kashmir markhor in Chitral demanded,"CHITRAL: Experts have called for the establishment of a rescue centre for here for markhors, snow leopards, and...","CHITRAL: Experts have called for the establishment of a rescue centre for here for markhors, snow leopards, and falcons.
“Chitral is home to different species of wildlife, especially Kashmir markhor, and therefore, a rescue centre for them should be set up to save the lives of the wild creatures injured in accidents and firing by poachers,” a conservationist working for a non-government organisation told Dawn.
He said the outbreak of diseases in pastures killed hundreds of wild animals in the past as there was no proper facility for their treatment.
The expert said the treatment of wild animals and birds was quite different from that of livestock, and therefore, it was beyond the capacity of doctors in the local veterinary hospital to handle it.
He said the treatment of injured or sick animals from Chitral in a specialised hospital in Peshawar wasn’t feasible as, first, it took more than 12 hours to shift them to the provincial capital, and second, the local temperature wasn’t appropriate for them, so they couldn’t adapt to it fast.
“The conservation model of the village conservation committee has worked well in Chitral. In this model, every member of the community acts as the guard of wild animals, so their numbers, especially those of markhors and snow leopards, have increased incredibly over the years,” he said.
The expert said the loss of one species could lead to the extinction of the other, as in the natural scheme of things, they had close interdependence.
He said the loss of a markhor meant a colossal loss of Rs50 million as the fee for trophy hunting was auctioned at that rate last year.
“Eighty per cent of the fee is transferred to the local community, which spends it on its collective development in a democratic way,” he said.
The conservationist said a few years ago, members of Denin VCC rescued a markhor by risking their lives as it got stranded on a steep hillock. 
He added that the markhor was shifted to the local veterinary hospital for treatment but succumbed to injuries in a Peshawar hospital.
“The local community shifted an injured cub of snow leopard to the local veterinary facility from where it was taken to Peshawar, but it was too late to save the life of the wild cat due to excessive bleeding,” he said.
The expert said presently, the only specialised facility for markhor was present in the core zone of Chitral Gol National Park, where sick or injured animals were quarantined.
He said that facility could be converted into a wildlife rescue centre with staff members trained in the treatment of wild animals.
Meanwhile, emir of Jamaat-i-Islami in Lower Chitral district Maulana Jamshed Ahmad and general secretary Wajeehuddin, and Al-Khidmat Foundation president Abdul Haq have demanded an early yet fair assessment of the damages caused by the recent torrential rains and snowfall here.
They told a joint news conference here the other day that Chitral’s poor residents had lost homes, crops, and orchards to the natural disaster, and therefore, the government should provide them with relief goods and proper compensation for damages.

“In the past, authorities approved plans for constructing commercial plazas and markets, though there was no mention of parking lots as well as firefighting and other necessary equipment, and therefore, both visitors and road users are now suffering the brunt,” former tehsil councillor Mohammad Akram told reporters in Oghi.
Accompanied by a group of locals, the former councillor said the government banned the construction of plazas and markets without toilets, fire systems, or parking lots, but even then, the TMA violated the ban by issuing non-objection certificates to property owners.
“Now, the people of Oghi and its suburbs are suffering as traffic remains blocked most of the day due to encroachments,” he said.
He said the TMA should ensure that all markets and commercial plazas built in the past make arrangements for the provision of basic facilities to visitors.
PROFITEERS: The food department on Wednesday began a crackdown on the traders hoarding wheat or selling it at an exorbitant rate in the district.
“We have arrested a wholesaler for selling a 20kg wheat flour bag for Rs2500 instead of the notified rate of Rs2300 and sealed his shop and godowns with hundreds of bags,” assistant food controller Shaukat Sultan told reporters.
He said a team of the police and food departments led by him, paid surprise visits to the area and adjoining areas to ensure that wheat flour was being sold at a price fixed by the government.
“Our teams have also been paying surprise visits across Oghi, Balakot, Baffa-Pakhal and Darband tehsils and other parts of Mansehra to ensure that nobody challenges the writ of the government,” he said.
Mr Sultan said traders were warned against overcharging customers to prevent heavy fines, the sealing of their shops and godowns, and detention.
