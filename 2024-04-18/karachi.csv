They were expressing their views at a gathering held at Sher Khan Malokhani village in Matiari district to mark the International Day of Peasants on Wednesday. 
Hari Welfare Association’s president Akram Ali Khaskheli said that his association had met caretaker prime minister along with Sindh Member on National Human Rights Commission, Anees Har­oon, to seek his help in getting Sindh government to withdraw its application and the prime minister had promised to do the needful but nothing happened apparently.
He said that PPP government appeared adamant to go against the pro-peasant rights judgement and lamented that it was despite the fact the party’s voter base comprised peasants and rural workers who were not ill-treated in agriculture sector. 
He said that Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950, was not implemented for around 74 years and in 2013 and onward the PPP government even changed certain provisions in Act to favour landlords.
He said the Act governed relationship between landlords and tenants, including sharecroppers in rural areas of Sindh. However, practically, only landlords governed this relationship and enjoyed all rights under the law while peasants remained poor and marginalised, he said.
The peasants never benefited from subsidies the government provided during floods and in the event of rise in inflation and equally suffered losses in production whereas only landlords were paid compensation, he said.
The gathering was told that the appeal was filed in January 2020 and then agriculture minister Ismail Rahu had confirmed the government would not pursue the appeal against the judgement in the apex court. But Sindh government, on the other hand, continued to fight the case till April 2023, he said.
The HWA received a copy of government’s plea which revealed the government had no concerns for the rights of peasants and rural workers and it was rather pursuing anti-peasant rights policies that aided repressive feudal system and structure, he said.
Sujag Women Hari Trade Union’s president Habib Khatoon said that lack of enforcement of law deprived peasants and rural workers of protection and welfare, exacerbating difficulties in accessing land and getting fair treatment in their relationship with landowners. 
She shared some cases about landlords’ ill-treatment of peasants her organisation had gathered in September 2023 and said that a landlord in Mirpurkhas attempted rape of a peasant girl and in Larkana a landlord allegedly murdered peasants.
She said that a landlord dispossessed peasants in Mithi in August and police lodged fake case against peasants in Dadu and later occupied their lands at the behest of an influential landlord. In Benazirabad, a landlord was allegedly involved in attempted rape of a peasant girl, she said.
She said that a landlord had allegedly killed a peasant in November in Mirpur­khas, a peasant’s sons were abducted over repayment of debt in Badin district 
and a landlord had allegedly kidnapped three daughters and their mother in Naushahro Feroze. Scores of peasants were forcibly evicted by landlords in other districts, she said.

The protesters led by Abdul Jabbar Panhwar placed hurdles on the road to cause traffic flow to come to a halt.
They complained to media persons that the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company’s (Hesco) officials had disconnected power supply to their areas six days ago without giving any reason, multiplying difficulties for thousands of people in Old Mirpur and its adjacent areas. 
They said that the power suspension also disrupted water supply to their localities, forcing people to buy costly water cans and bottles for drinking and meeting other daily needs. 
They demanded higher authorities take notice of their plight and ensure power supply was restored to their areas without further delay.

2,Literati bemoan children’s lack of access to books,LARKANA: Speakers at a book launch lament that children in remote countryside areas have no access at all to ...,"LARKANA: Speakers at a book launch lament that children in remote countryside areas have no access at all to literary books while closed, partially functional and destroyed primary and middle-level schools in flood-hit, tribal feuds-ridden and dacoits-infested areas have already deprived children of even basic education, not to speak of literature. 
They were sharing their views at the launching ceremony of an anthology of 17 short stories for children in Sindhi Kang ji nani (Crow’s grandma) by Ustad Gul Dayo held under the aegis of the Literature Depart­ment at Arts Council Larkana the other day. 
Dr Zulfiqar Syial, prominent writer and poet who presided over the program, said that of thousands of poets and writers who lived in Sindh if each of them wrote only one book for children it would suffice enriching children’s literature in Sindhi. 
He said that greater amount of literature had been produced for children in Urdu and the same was true for literature in English. Even the most prominent poets like Dr Allama Iqbal and Sufi Ghulam Mustafa Tabassum had written for children, which only a few people knew about and read, he said. 
He said that all creative writers must write for children and their creations should have elements of education, entertainment and knowledge in order to entertain and educate children. Ustad Dayo’s storybook had all the three ingredients, he said. 
Prof Mukhtiar Samo, writer and founder of Knowledge Centre, said that Sindh’s educational institutions had failed in exposing children to the world of literature due to lack of libraries. If there was a library, it was not fully equipped or functional and was short of literary books, he regretted. 
He said that whatever scanty literature was produced for children in Sindh was not reaching their targeted readership. The children in remote areas and countryside of Sindh had no access at all to literary books. In addition, closed, partially functional and destroyed primary and middle-level schools in flood-hit, tribal feuds-ridden and dacoits-infested areas had deprived children of even basic education, not to speak of literature, he said.  
He praised Ustad Dayo’s efforts for the promotion of children’s literature and said his book on stories and poetry had always been an interesting read for children. 
Ustad Dayo, the author, said: “Whatever I have written for children have been done with honesty and with the aim of betterment of children so that they read it, learn lessons and develop reading habit”. 
He thanked the appreciation of his work and vowed to continue it in future as well. 
Mumtaz Lohar, short story writer and poet, said that it was good to write fiction and poetry for children but writers were also encouraged to pen profiles of exceptional children who excelled in their studies, art and creativity. 
Prof Jahangir Abbasi, fiction writer and translator, said that many prominent writers had started writing for children but later gave up the idea and limited their writings to grown-up readers only. He urged them to resume contributing to children’s literature.

5,‘Drifting’ BMW on Karachi’s DHA road lands doctor in lock-up,"Infrastructure in Bukhari Commercial Area has been ""substantially"" damaged, senior police official says.","KARACHI: Police have detained a doctor and impounded his BMW for allegedly damaging newly built infrastructure in Defence Housing Authority by ‘drifting’ his car.

7,Custodial death case takes new turn as allegations surface against former SP of Clifton division,"Slain suspect was tortured at a private place after SP Nayyar removed him from lock-up, magistrate told.","• Slain suspect was tortured at a private place after SP Nayyar removed him from lock-up, magistrate told
• Darakhshan SHO, head moharir remanded in police custody
KARACHI: A case pertaining to the custodial death of a suspect took a new turn on Wednesday when a judicial magistrate was informed that a senior police officer had shifted Moiz Naeem from the Darakhshan police station to a private place, where he was subjected to severe torture and died.
On April 15, suspect Naeem was found dead in the lock-up of the Darakhshan police station and a post-mortem examination revealed that he was tortured to death. The police arrested Darkhshan SHO Ali Raza Leghari and head moharir Faisal Leghari and registered a murder case against them.
On Wednesday, the investigating officer (IO) brought the held suspects before Judicial Magistrate Mazhar Ali and requested for their 14-day physical remand for further investigation. However, the court remanded the suspects in police custody till April 21 and directed the IO to produce them in court on the next date.
Representing held SHO Ali Raza, Advocate Salahuddin Panhwar appeared before the magistrate and informed him that SP-Clifton Nayyar-ul-Hassan took the victim from Darkhshan police station to a private location where he was allegedly subjected to torture and subsequently died.
Advocate Panhwar told Dawn that he informed the magistrate that Sub-Inspector Sanaullah Soomro had arrested the suspect Naeem in connection with an extortion case. But after his death, the SP attempted to ‘manipulate’ the situation by claiming that the suspect died of a heart attack.
It may be noted that SP Nayyer was transferred by Karachi police chief Imran Yaqoob Minhas on the same day when suspect Naeem died in police custody.
Also on Wednesday, Junaid, son of deceased Naeem, was also brought before the magistrate after completion of his initial remand period in the same extortion case in which his father was arrested.
During the proceeding held inside the judge’s chamber, Barrister Zainul Abideen filed an application on behalf of the legal heirs of the deceased to assist the prosecution.
He argued on behalf of suspect Junaid that the police did not obtain a warrant to arrest his client. He contended that it was merely a monetary dispute between Naeem and complainant Abdul Basit. He claimed that the police first apprehended his client and then registered the FIR.
The IO sought an extension in Junaid’s police remand but the court sent him to prison on judicial remand.

8,Situationer: Is time up for Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori?,"MQM-P says federal govt hasn’t asked for change of governor or appointment of a new one in Sindh, at any level.","IT looks like it’s not yet over for Kamran Tessori. Having support from all stakeholders in the past, it appears he still has his charms, although rumours are rife about his imminent departure from the palatial Sindh Governor House and even his own associates believe he’s still in deep water.
The businessman-turned-politician was appointed the Sindh governor in October 2022 as a nominee of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) as a result of a power-sharing agreement between his party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
After the Feb 8 general elections and formation of the Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government, it was agreed between the PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) that the governors of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab would be from the PPP while the governors of Sindh and Balochistan would be from PML-N. Later, the PML-N decided to give the governor’s post to its coalition partner the MQM-P.
During talks with the PML-N after the elections, the MQM-P had made clear to it that it was not interested in replacing Mr Tessori. However, it was the PPP which asked the PML-N to remove the incumbent Sindh governor.

MQM-P says federal govt hasn’t asked for change of governor or appointment of a new one in Sindh, at any level

Sources said that President Asif Zardari was reportedly not happy with Governor Tessori due to some of his actions during the caretaker set-up in the province and he had conveyed to the PML-N and powerful quarters that a new governor must be appointed in Sindh.
Earlier this month, the PPP took a firm stand against governor Tessori. First, PPP-Sindh General Secretary Waqar Mehdi issued a hard-hitting statement, accusing Mr Tessori of widening the gulf between urban and rural population of Sindh and demanding his removal. Then, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab fired a salvo that the decision to replace the incumbent governor had already been taken but the implementation was delayed due to Ramazan.
While the PML-N kept mum, the PPP’s opposition to Mr Tessori casts doubts about his future.
Several names have sprung up, including ex-MQM MNA and senator Khushbakht Shujaat, Senator-elect Faisal Vawda, former law minister Dr Farogh Nasim and ex-chairman of Board of Investment Azfar Ahsan as potential successor of the incumbent governor. Former caretaker chief minister and retired Justice Maqbool Baqar is the latest addition in the long list of names.
The sources said that initially, the MQM-P had itself considered the idea of replacing Mr Tessori but the hard-hitting statements by the PPP against him compelled the party to take a firm position in his favour.
When contacted, a spokesperson for the Sindh governor told Dawn: “The MQM-P has given only Kamran Tessori’s name [to the PML-N to retain him as the governor] and if any other name comes up, it will not be from the MQM-P.”
When Dawn approached the MQM-P about the future of Mr Tessori, a party spokesperson claimed that the federal government had not contacted the party at any level regarding the change of the Sindh governor or the appointment of a new governor in Sindh.
“We have only learned about these discussions through the media. If we are officially contacted on this matter, we will provide a position after consulting internally, but for now, any speculation is premature,” he said.
When asked to comment on whether the party was considering Khushbakht Shujaat, Faisal Vawda, Azfar Ahsan or Farogh Nasim as Mr Tessori’s replacement, the spokesperson said: “When the federal government has not contacted MQM-Pakistan regarding the change of the governor, and based on our information, no such decision is imminent, then we have no intention of proposing or discussing any alternative names for the governor of Sindh.”
However, a senior MQM-P leader, privy to the internal discussions about Mr Tessori’s fate, told Dawn that the incumbent governor was still in hot water. “I think we have to make a decision soon,” he said.
“The governor has stirred a hornet’s nest when he played a proactive role in the affairs of the Sindh bureaucracy during the caretaker government. Besides, his decision to turn [part of] Governor House into an IT learning centre does not bode well for many and it seems he is paying the price of his popularity,” the leader said.
Regarding potential candidates, he said Khushbakht Shujaat chose not to contest Feb 8 general elections from the platform of the MQM-P, despite the fact that she was asked to file her nomination papers from the Clifton-Defence National Assembly constituency (NA-241). “She has not been seen in any important party activity for quite some time…I don’t know whether she’s still with us or not,” he added.
However, the MQM-P spokesperson, when asked about Ms Shujaat’s status in the party, said: “Former Senator Khushbakht Shujaat remains in touch with us, just as she has been in the past.”
Meanwhile, it seems it’s business as usual for the governor as he administered the oath to the newly inducted members of Murad Ali Shah-led Sindh cabinet, chaired a meeting of business community and met Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab at the Governor House on Wednesday.

9,Major uplift projects to be executed after assessing environmental impact: mayor,KARACHI: Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday vowed that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) would be...,"KARACHI: Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday vowed that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) would be conducted before formal launch of any major development projects by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
To a question about neglecting environmental hazards while undertaking development projects in the city, he said though none of those projects was actually carried out by the KMC, they all were initiated after due approval from the relevant forums.
“But let me assure you that any major project launched by the KMC would go through EIA first,” he said while talking to reporters. “There are many major projects in the pipeline, including expansion of Malir Bridge, a connectivity road over Shahra-i-Noor Jehan, other drainage building and infrastructure enhancement scheme. We would definitely keep environmental aspect as one of key priorities in all these projects,” he added.
He referred to challenges being faced as mayor due to bifurcation of powers among different organisations and authorities. He also cited the issues of jurisdictions of town administrations and the KMC which most of the times were ignored by the “critics” while blaming the city mayor for all issues faced by the metropolis.
“There are certain roads which are managed, controlled and maintained by the KMC and the rest fall under different authorities or bodies,” said Mayor Wahab.
“These things need to be highlighted, which would bring true understanding among the people to reach out the right person or authority to address their problems. But sometimes for the sake of politics, people even those who know all these bifurcations criticise the KMC for point scoring,” he said.
He claimed that the relations between the ruling Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and opposition Jamaat-i-Islami had “improved” lately and the two parties had witnessed positive changes from both sides recently.
“Our relationship with the opposition has definitely improved recently,” said Barrister Wahab. “The leader of the opposition in the City Council, Saifuddin Advocate, is quite a reasonable person and gentleman. He understands the issues and gives space. I strongly believe that we should shed all political differences when it comes to the development of Karachi. That’s the message which I often convey to all stakeholders of the city,” he concluded.

PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh along with Khurram Sher Zaman, Raja Azhar and many party workers reached the Quaid’s mausoleum on Wednesday to pay their respects before inspecting preparations at Bagh-i-Jinnah in the shadows of the mausoleum. 
The party is yet to get an official permission from the Sindh government authorities to hold the public meeting.
On Tuesday, the Sindh High Court has directed the authorities concerned that the PTI applications seeking permission to hold the public meeting must be processed in accordance with law.   
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi also asked the authorities to furnish a compliance report on the subject matter by April 19, if there was no legal impediment.   
The bench further ordered the deputy commissioner (East) to appear in court on next hearing and the reply/objections, if any, should be filed with advance copy to the lawyer for petitioner.  
Citing the chief secretary of Sindh, commissioner of Karachi and DC (East) as respondents, PTI Sindh general secretary Ali Ahmed Palh petitioned the SHC and submitted that the party had approached the district and provincial administration on a number of occasions for permission or no-objection certificate (NOC) to hold a public gathering, but to no avail.   
The petitioner submitted that initially, an application was filed with the DC concerned on March 21 seeking permission to hold a public meeting on April 21, at a ground adjacent to Mazar-i-Quaid from 4pm to midnight and proper access for people to the venue without any hindrance.   
The petitioner asserted that he had a detailed meeting with the DC regarding the process and timely permission and the deputy commissioner had agreed upon venue and timing of such public gathering.   
However, he maintained that since the DC had not granted the NOC, the petitioner moved another identical application on March 27, but no response was forthcoming and therefore, the party was forced to change the intended date by a week (April 28) and approached the chief secretary and the commissioner, but they also remained unable to make a decision on the subject matter.
