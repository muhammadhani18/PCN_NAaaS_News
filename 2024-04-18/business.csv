0,Fiscal gap to widen to 7.4pc of GDP,IMF says revenues to stay stagnant despite falling expenditures in five years.,"ISLAMABAD: Projecting stagnant tax-to-GDP ratios over the next five years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday estimated Pakistan’s fiscal deficit — the gap between total resources and expenditures — for the current fiscal year at 7.4 per cent of GDP, almost 1pc higher than 6.5pc target set by the federal government.
On the positive side, however, the fund anticipates a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios and general government expenditures over the medium term. Also, the primary fiscal balance has been estimated to remain 0.4 to 0.5pc of GDP over the next five years, compared to a 0.9pc primary deficit in FY23.
The centre had estimated the overall fiscal deficit at Rs6.9 trillion for the current fiscal year (6.53pc of GDP) on the anticipation that provinces would offer Rs600bn surplus to scale down the federal deficit otherwise estimated at Rs7.5tr or 7.1pc of GDP. The IMF had previously projected the fiscal deficit at 7.6pc of GDP in October last year but has since revised it to 7.4pc, apparently based on the latest data shared by the government last month as part of a quarterly review.
 
 

In its fiscal monitor released on Wednesday as part of spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank currently in progress in Washington, the fund forecast fiscal deficit declining 7.3pc of GDP in FY25 — significantly higher than its 6.9pc forecast made in October last year. In the same direction, the IMF made upward adjustments in deficit estimates for Pakistan.

IMF says revenues to stay stagnant despite falling expenditures in five years

In doing so, the fund forecast a 5.8pc fiscal deficit for FY26, followed by 5.1pc in FY27 and staying at 4.6pc in FY28 and FY29. In October last year, the IMF predicted Pakistan’s fiscal deficit to be 6.9pc in FY25, 5.4pc in FY26, 4.4pc in FY27 and 4.4pc in FY28.
The fiscal monitor for April 2024 also put primary budget surplus — the difference between revenues and expenditures excluding interest payments — at 0.4pc of GDP for FY24, followed by 0.5pc in FY25 and then staying stable at 0.4pc over the next three consecutive years and again at 0.5pc in FY29. In October last, the IMF had pitched a primary deficit for FY23 at 1.2pc of GDP compared to 0.5pc claimed by the government, which turned out to be a 0.9pc deficit, according to the latest statement of the IMF.
Referring to the revenue side, the IMF projected general government revenue to be  12.5pc of GDP for the current fiscal year ending June 30, up from 11.4pc last year. The fiscal monitor predicts general government revenue at 12.4pc for the next two fiscal years, FY25 and FY26, 12.3pc in the following two years, FY27 and FY28, and then back to 12.4pc in FY29.
The fund has not changed its revenue-to-GDP ratio estimates for all these years.
On the expenditure front, the fiscal monitor estimates general government expenditure at 19.9pc of GDP for FY24, significantly higher than 19.2pc in FY23. It then anticipates a gradual yearly decline over the medium term as debt servicing costs ease. The general expenditure will drop to 19.6pc in FY25), followed by 18.1pc in FY26, 17.5pc in FY27, 17pc in FY28 and 16.9pc in FY29. The fund has slightly revised its previous forecasts about the expenditure to GDP ratio by 0.2 to 0.3pc for these years.
Falling govt debts
Likewise, the IMF expects the gross government debt to ease down to 71.8pc of GDP at the end of the current fiscal year from 77.1pc last year. It anticipates a declining trend, but more is needed to eliminate vicious violations of the Fiscal Responsibility & Debt Limitation Act (FDRLA), which seeks to ensure that debt always remains below 60pc of GDP.
The IMF projects the gross government debt-to-GDP ratio to come down to 69.4pc next year, followed by 68.4pc in FY26 and 66.8pc in FY27. The debt is expected to drop to 64.8pc in FY28 and 63.1pc in FY29.
The fund noted that Pakistan would be among the economies with relatively high deficit levels and projected to undergo rapid fiscal consolidation over the medium term.

1,Power firms seek to extract Rs23bn more for March,Nepra to consider petition for Rs2.94 per unit FCA rise on April 26.,"ISLAMABAD: Despite 79 per cent of power generation coming from cheaper local fuels, the government has sought clearance from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to extract about Rs23 billion additional in fuel cost adjustment (FCA) from consumers for electricity consumed in March.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the Power Division — has demanded Rs2.94 per unit additional fuel cost to recover from consumers through May bills. 
The proposed additional FCA is almost 46pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs6.44 per unit already charged to consumers in March. This raises questions about the power sector bureaucracy’s capabilities to forecast fuel costs even for 6-7 months. In recent months, the additional FCAs have ranged between 50 and 115pc higher than the pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the current fiscal year.

Nepra to consider petition for Rs2.94 per unit FCA rise on 26th

This FCA is on top of about a 26pc increase in the annual base tariff and another 10pc hike under the quarterly tariff adjustment currently in place and being charged to consumers at Rs2.75 per unit. As a result, consumers continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption patterns. This was despite more than 79pc of electricity coming from cheaper local resources. Nepra has accepted the request for a public hearing on April 26.
The higher proposed FCA for March is apparently mainly due to higher domestic coal and gas prices, although the use of imported fuels like coal, diesel, and furnace oil remained zero. LNG was relatively cheaper, and the exchange rate remained stable.
In a petition, the CPPA, acting as commercial agent of Discos, demanded an additional FCA of Rs2.94 per unit in the May bills for electricity consumed in March. It claimed that the reference fuel cost for March was Rs6.44 per unit, but the actual fuel cost rose to Rs9.38 per unit. The average fuel cost in February also stood at about Rs9.42 per unit. It said about 8,023-gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs66.7bn (Rs8.3 per unit) in March, of which 7,756 GWh energy was delivered to Discos at the cost of Rs72.67bn (at Rs9.38 per unit).
The data showed declining consumption trends. The consumption in March was also 8.3pc lower than same month (8,459Gwh) last year. The Rs2.94 per unit FCA for March this year is more than double the Rs1.17 per unit FCA of same month last year.
This included the biggest share of hydropower at 28pc in March against its 25pc share in February. Hydropower has no fuel cost.

2,High yields dim rate cut hopes,"T-bill auction exceeds target, high borrowing persists.","KARACHI: The government surpassed the target and raised significantly more funds than the maturity amount through an auction of treasury bills on Wednesday.
Notably, the cut-off yields on the T-bills remained unchanged, despite expectations that declining inflation would allow the government to borrow at a cheaper rate.
In March, inflation fell to a nearly two-year low of 20.7 per cent, indicating a declining trend that could prompt the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to cut the record-high 22pc policy interest rate. However, the latest T-bill rates suggest the future interest rate trend.
The government raised Rs82.7 billion for three-month bills at 21.66pc, Rs13bn for six-month bills at 21.31pc, and Rs442bn for 12-month bills at 20.84pc.

T-bill auction exceeds target, high borrowing persists

The government raised Rs538bn against the Rs525bn target for this auction; however, the maturity amount was just Rs173bn. This indicates that the government is borrowing more than the required amount, resulting in increased public debt, with debt servicing consuming a significant portion of the country’s generated revenue.
Analysts and experts anticipate a rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy scheduled for April 29, but the decision to maintain cut-off yields at 21.6pc reflects the SBP’s cautious approach. A senior analyst said high inflation projections, averaging around 25pc for FY24 according to the IMF, may deter the SBP from reducing interest rates, as seen in the previous monetary policy in March.
Persistently high interest rates have stifled economic growth, drawing criticism from the trade, industry and agriculture sectors. These sectors contend that the expensive money inflates the cost of doing business, exacerbating inflationary pressure. Some bankers said the central bank’s policies have failed to counter inflation and are responsible for the poor economic growth rate.
The World Bank estimates 2pc GDP growth for FY24. Many in the financial market doubt this figure, as most economic sectors are facing high costs. Exporters are advocating for a reduction in interest rates, as they have become uncompetitive in international markets due to the high cost of production.

3,Rupee loses more value against dollar,Currency dealers say there is no obvious reason for the recent appreciating trend for the dollar.,"KARACHI: The rupee remained under pressure against the US dollar for the third consecutive session on Wednesday despite positive talks with the visiting Saudi delegation and International Monetary Fund.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported the dollar appreciated by another 11 paise against the local currency to Rs278.40 from Rs278.29 a day earlier.
Currency dealers said there was no obvious reason for the recent appreciating trend for the dollar. They maintained that the weaknesses in the exchange rate is known for years and the market behaves according the information about availability of the dollars in the market, reserves of the SBP and possibility of inflows in future.
The Saudi delegation has assured investment in Pakistan, but it may take time since the kingdom has initiated the groundwork for identifying sectors and projects for future investments. The Saudi government announced last year that it had changed its strategy to support Pakistan with loans, aid, or grants; instead, investments could be made to help the country.
However, the Saudi government has already placed $2bn in the account of the State Bank to support the weak foreign exchange reserves of the SBP. It did the same in the past. 
Banking sources said the Saudi government had deposited $5bn in the SBP account.

The total drop in the above segment stood at 38pc to 69,078 units during 9MFY24 as compared to 110,898 in the same period last fiscal year due to the declining trend in auto financing, thanks to an unprecedented interest rate of 22pc, soaring prices, and consumers’ shrinking purchasing power.
According to data issued by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers (PAMA), sales of tractors surged by 66pc to 35,199 units in July-March from 21,233 units due to the low base of last year amid the flood. In contrast, truck, bus, and two/three-wheelers sales decreased by 45pc, 39pc, and 10pc, respectively.

5,Oil falls nearly 3pc,Analysts do not expect Iran’s strike on Israel to prompt dramatic US sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.,"NEW YORK: Oil prices slipped nearly three per cent on Wednesday, pressured by a rise in US commercial inventories, wea­ker economic data from China and US progress on Ukraine and Israel aid bills.
Brent futures for June were down $2.44, or 2.7pc, to $87.58 a barrel at 12:20pm ET (1720 GMT), while US crude futures for May were down $2.32, or 2.7pc, at $83.00 a barrel. Both were on track for their biggest fall since March 20.
Oil prices have softened this week as economic headwinds curb gains from geopolitical tensions, with markets eyeing how Israel might respond to Iran’s weekend attack.
Analysts do not expect Iran’s unprecedented missile and drone strike on Israel to prompt dramatic US sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.
“Oil prices go about their business of unwinding some of the war premium that has been priced in,” said John Evans at oil broker PVM.
US crude inventories rose by 2.7 million barrels to 460 million barrels last week, government data showed, nearly double analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.4m-barrel build.
Oil prices continued to decline after US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said the text of four bills providing assistance to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific would be filed “soon today,” with a fourth with “other measures to confront Russia, China and Iran” posted later in the day.

6,FPCCI rejects hike in petroleum prices,Says govt should have kept petroleum prices unchanged given the slide in international oil prices this week.,"KARACHI: Trade and industry have rejected the upward revision of petroleum prices, saying that it will further increase the cost of doing business amid the already high utility bills.
On Tuesday, the government jacked up petrol price by Rs4.53 to Rs293.94 per litre and that of diesel by Rs8.14 rise to Rs290.38.
Atif Ikram Sheikh, President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said on Wednesday the government should have kept petroleum prices unchanged given the slide in international oil prices this week.
He said a trend was there for all to see that the rupee would remain largely stable in the coming weeks due to completion of the standby arrangement with the IMF and the start of a long-term IMF programme, known as the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
Furthermore, Atif Sheikh added, Saudi Arabia has decided to raise its foreign exchange deposit with the State Bank of Pakistan by $2 billion to take it to $5bn.
The FPCCI chief said the aforementioned factors had armed the government with a reasonable cushion and it could have absorbed minor fluctuations in oil prices in the international market.
Atif Sheikh recalled that the FPCCI had warned the government a number of times that it needed to address teething problems in the import of Russian crude _ handling of oil cargo, adjustments required vis-à-vis refining processes and transactional procedures to settle oil payments.

7,"Stocks fall on weaker rupee, IMF uncertainty",Topline Securities Ltd says a section of investors indulged in profit-taking in the energy and fertiliser sectors.," 


KARACHI: The stock market extended its overnight losses on Wednesday amid a weaker rupee and contraction in Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) production.
Projections of low economic growth and high inflation amid uncertainty about the outcome of the talks for a new IMF loan programme turned equities investors further cautious.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said investors weighed down the dismal LSM numbers, the IMF’s higher inflation projection of 24.8 per cent and subdued economic growth of 2pc for FY24.
 
 

As for this fiscal year’s first eight months (July to February), the LSM index shrank 0.51pc year-on-year. The PBS data showed that the cumulative change in the index was negative for the 20th month in a row, i.e. since July 2022.
He added that falling global oil prices impacted the growth outlook, a weaker rupee and ongoing geopolitical tensions contributed to the bearish close.
In the last three sessions of the current week, the rupee depreciated by 46 paise to Rs278.40 against the US dollar in the interbank market amid the State Bank of Pakistan’s dwindling forex holdings following the clearing payment of a $1 bn eurobond, which matured on April 15.
Topline Securities Ltd said equities kicked off the session on a positive note, but at the day’s high, a section of investors indulged in profit-taking in the energy and fertiliser sectors, and as a result, the index closed in the red for the second day in a row.
Consequently, the day’s neg­ative contributors were Engro Fertilisers, Oil and Gas Development Company, Engro Corp­oration, Fauji Fertiliser Company and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, which wiped out 196 points from the index. On the other hand, Bank Alfalah Ltd, United Bank Lte and Bank Alhabib Ltd attracted buying interest adding 99 points.
As a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index hit an intraday high of 70,725.50, gaining 241.84 points, and a low of 70,037.28, losing 446.38 points. However, it closed at 70,333.31 points after losing 150.34 points, or 0.21pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume dipped further by 19.38pc to 442.09 million shares. The traded value also dropped 23.76pc to Rs16.03bn on a day-on-day basis.
Foreign investors turned net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $0.40m.
