1,Govt urged to re-evaluate energy pricing,Business leaders cite detrimental impact of skyrocketing costs on industrial sectors,"Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) President Khawaja Mahboobur Rehman has strongly demanded that the government re-evaluate the policy of continuously increasing energy prices on an immediate basis.
Particularly, the decision to increase the captive gas price to Rs2,750/MMBtu, an increase of 223% since January 2023 threatened the very survival of Pakistan’s industrial sectors and a complete collapse is imminent.
He said the direct consequence of spiralling energy costs is an increase in production costs across all industrial sectors, forcing businesses to pass these costs onto consumers. This results in widespread price increases; exacerbating the financial strain on consumers already battling relentless inflation for the past two years, he added.

PBF President stressed that the consumer demand was poised to reduce further as a result; which would further prompt a reduction in manufacturing activities. The resulting inflation also rules out any possibility of a reduction in interest rates in the foreseeable future; leading to the further downfall of the private sector.
Khawaja Mahboob urged the government to conduct an all-encompassing reassessment of its energy pricing framework as electricity prices for industrial consumers are well above 17 cents/kWh which is twice as high as those in regional economies like Bangladesh and India.
With yet another increase in gas prices, manufacturing activity is no longer financially feasible in Pakistan and there will be no investment – domestic or foreign in the country under these conditions.

3,ECP restores PML-N wins in capital,"Re-notifies Anjum Aqeel from NA-46, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry from NA-47","The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) restored on Friday the victory notifications of three Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidates who won seats from Islamabad’s National Assembly constituencies of NA-46, NA-47 and NA-48.
The electoral watchdog upheld the victory of PML-N’s Anjum Aqeel from NA-46, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry from NA-47 and Raja Khurram Nawaz from NA-48.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had challenged the victories of PML-N candidates based on alleged rigging during the February 8 general elections.
Chaudhry, speaking to the media, said that PTI was doing propaganda regarding the federal capital’s constituencies, adding that they submitted their Form 45 today and now the court had to prove whose forms were genuine.
The ECP on Tuesday reserved its decision in two cases regarding rigging in the Feb 8 general elections and postponed the hearing of three cases till Feb 27, seeking reports from the returning officers.
A two-member bench of the ECP comprising Nisar Durrani and Justice (retd) Ikramullah heard the application of Ayaz Ameer from NA-58 Chakwal.
Meanwhile, a two-member bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, heard the petition of Alia Hamza from NA-118 Lahore.
Alia’s lawyer Raja Aamir Abbas submitted a letter of attorney, requesting that he be given a date to present his arguments. The ECP adjourned the hearing till Feb 27.
Similarly, the bench took up Yasmin Rashid’s plea against rigging in the NA-130 Lahore constituency. The bench sought a report from the returning officer and adjourned the hearing till Feb 27.
Earlier this week, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) suspended the victory notifications of the PML-N candidates from the three Islamabad NA constituencies. A two-member division bench comprising Justice Mian Gul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir suspended the notification of the success of Anjum Aqeel Khan from NA-46, Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhary from NA 47, Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz from NA-48.
During the hearing of intra-court appeals filed by Aamir Mughal, Shoaib Shaheen Advocate and Ali Bukhari against the election results, Shoaib Shaheen Advocate said that he received around 380 Forms 45 that night.
The complainant further informed the court that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) then issued an order to the RO to stop the final consolidation and sought a report within three days, but it has not been submitted yet.
The court then suspended the notification of the victory of the candidates of the three constituencies. The court’s decision followed intra-court appeals filed against the election results.

5,SC for resolving varsity’s land case,CJP instructs CDA to decide allotment issue after consulting with the petitioner,"The Supreme Court of Pakistan has directed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and EN Point – an international company – to resolve the land allotment case for the construction of the International IT University in Islamabad within a month.
A three-member bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, conducted the hearing of the case on Friday in the Supreme Court. This is the same location where the IT University was being constructed, said Justice Musarrat Hilali during the proceeding.
Responding to the court’s queries, the CDA lawyer stated that the contract with the company was terminated after consultation. However, he mentioned that the company could still purchase the land at the current market rate.

CJP Isa suggested, “Make a new contract if you are ready to provide the land. It is commendable that an international university is expanding its presence in Pakistan. While we're not singling out anyone, many people were given land free of cost for educational institutions in Pakistan. We are keen on encouraging foreign investment, and it is a good thing that an outsider is establishing a university.
Justice Musarrat Hilali pointed out that earlier access to the land was denied because it was under consideration by someone else, and now foreign investment interest has emerged.
The court’s ruling highlighted that the lease of Rs483.960 million was signed between the International Company and CDA for 41.2 acres of land on Islamabad Curry Road. The company was obligated to make the remaining payment of Rs170 million. The court specified that the land allocated should strictly be used for university purposes only.
