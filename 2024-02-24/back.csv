0,"IHC set to review Imran's gifts, cipher appeals",Division bench also scheduled to take up applications seeking bail in £190m case," 
The capital’s high court is scheduled to hear tomorrow, Monday, the appeals filed by former prime minister Imran Khan against his convictions in the state gift repository—Toshakhana—and the diplomatic cipher cases.

The same division bench comprising Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb will also address the appeals filed by Imran’s co-accused—former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi.

A special court sentenced Imran and Qureshi to 10 years in prison in the diplomatic cipher case on Jan 30. A day later, on Jan 31, an accountability court sentenced the former PM and his wife to 14 years in prison in the gift repository case.
On Monday, the IHC bench will also consider the bail applications of the accused individuals, seeking suspension of the sentences handed down by the trial courts just a week before the Feb 8 general elections.

Additionally, a division bench consisting of Justice Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri will hear on Monday, Feb 26, the post-arrest bail applications of the PTI founder and his wife in the £190m corruption case.

Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore extended until March 1 the interim bail granted to Imran in seven different cases of vandalism registered after the May 9, 2023 riots.

During the proceedings, ATC Judge Arshad Javed expressed his annoyance with the Adiala Jail authorities, who failed to ensure the former premier's appearance in court through video link or WhatsApp call.

Imran has been detained at the prison facility in Rawalpindi since September last year.

The court remarked during the hearing that the Adiala Jail superintendent had committed contempt of court. However, the judge noted that if action was taken against the superintendent, the decision on the accused's bail might be delayed.

Deputy Prosecutor Abdul Jabbar Dogar did not object to deciding the bail applications on merit. He took the position that the presence of the accused in the courtroom was not crucial.

“Everyone knows that the founder of PTI is in Adiala Jail. It is better to complete arguments on bail in his absence.”
The PTI founder's lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, agreed with the proposal to present arguments on the bail extension.
The ATC later decided to proceed with the court proceedings in the absence of the accused and extended his interim bail until March 1.

1,PTI shying away from PM contest: Bilawal,PPP chairman says Imran's letter to IMF 'unmasked his real face',"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Saturday claimed that PTI founder Imran Khan was backing down from the prime ministerial race, saying that he was deliberately refraining from fielding a candidate for the slot against PML-N’s Shehbaz Sharif.

During a visit to the New Karachi area, Bilawal asserted that the PTI should be honest with its workers about lacking a majority in the National Assembly, adding that the former ruling party did not obstruct Shehbaz’s path as it had insufficient number to form a government.

He speculated, ""I think Khan sahib himself must have decided not to field a candidate against Shehbaz Sharif.""
Commenting on Imran’s letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding election rigging and audit, the PPP chairman dismissed its efficacy, warning that it would only exacerbate the crisis in Pakistan, leading to increased unemployment and inflation.

He accused Imran of prioritising his political interests over national concerns. “He has been unmasked before the people.”
Bilawal also lamented the loss of two party workers in violent incidents during the election, criticising the law enforcement agencies' performance.

He announced plans to establish a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) after forming the government in Sindh to probe election-related violence and ensure justice for the victims.

On allegations of rigging, Bilawal challenged political parties to provide evidence and questioned the legitimacy of the claims.

He affirmed that the PPP emerged victorious in two provincial seats in Karachi (PS-124 and PS-125) according to Form-45, accusing the process of being rigged against them.

In response to accusations of rigging, Bilawal stated: ""We will fight the legal battle with evidence, hope justice will be served, and if not, the next course of action will be announced.""

He denounced political parties relying on rigging for victory, describing their protests as attempts at blackmail.

He asserted that those who were raising concerns about rigging had a history of never securing victories in Sindh.

According to the PPP chief, the protesters were not genuinely opposing rigging; rather, they were attempting to manipulate the system further.

He emphasised the PPP's commitment to preventing such incidents in the future and ensuring a fair political landscape.
Bilawal said that the PPP will forever remember the injustices and the sacrifices made during the elections.

He underscored the point that religious, linguistic, and communal terrorism constitute a red line for his party, declaring that such activities will not be tolerated in the city or the province under any circumstances.

Bilawal issued a stern warning to parties seeking to foster terrorism, making it clear that such endeavours would not be allowed to flourish in the province.

3,NEPRA orders inquiry into power rate hike demand,Regulatory cracks down on overbilling scam," 
 The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has initiated an inquiry into the operations of Power Distribution Companies (Discos) following their request for a Rs7.13 per unit increase in electricity rates for the month of January 2024 under the fuel adjustment mechanism.

During a hearing on Friday, NEPRA Chairman Waseem Mukhtar expressed concerns over the demand, noting that there were no changes in fuel prices and exchange rates.

Mukhtar, alongside members Engineer Maqsood Anwar Khan and Rafique Ahmad Shaikh, delved into the details of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA)'s petition.

The regulatory voiced serious concerns about the hefty proposed increase, attributing it to systemic deficiencies within distribution companies.

NEPRA's scrutiny revealed irregularities in load-shedding patterns across regions, raising doubts about the authenticity of the proposed adjustments, despite claims of low power demand.

Furthermore, NEPRA drew attention to a backlog of pending power connections, amounting to 550 MW, criticising Discos for their inability to justify previous claims made during hearings.

With 160,000 pending connections in Discos, Chairman Mukhtar underscored NEPRA's commitment to accountability, announcing plans for a comprehensive investigation into Discos' operations under the 27A of the NEPRA Act.

In addition to seeking an increase in rates, distribution companies are also looking to impose a burden of Rs26.7 billion on consumers in a single month, citing transmission system stability issues.

Meanwhile, member Rafique Ahmad Shaikh questioned the petitioner about the substantial claim, particularly regarding challenges in the South-North transmission corridor over several years.

The petitioner clarified that the issue stemmed from system stability rather than constraints.

The ongoing situation demands urgent attention and a proactive approach from the government, economy, and the power sector, stated Mukhtar, urging the Power Division to devise effective strategies to mitigate the prevailing challenges.

The NEPRA chief emphasized the imperative for tangible solutions to prevent further escalation of prices and demand, cautioning against perpetuation of the current cycle.

In light of stable fuel prices and exchange rates, NEPRA admonished the power division against unfounded claims, signalling a departure from previous leniency towards such requests.

The chairman concluded by reaffirming NEPRA's commitment to serving both the government and consumers, asserting a zero-tolerance policy towards failures in power provision and urging proactive measures to address systemic inefficiencies.
The NEPRA's decision marks a significant step towards enhancing transparency and accountability within Pakistan's power sector, as stakeholders work towards sustainable solutions to meet the nation's energy needs.Directive against excessive billings scamMeanwhile, the NEPRA issued directives on Friday to power distribution companies to take action against officials involved in an overbilling scam.

The move comes following a NEPRA inquiry in December 2023, revealing that not a single distribution company had carried out correct billings.

The inquiry disclosed that over 13 million consumers were charged for more than 30 days of electricity usage, while 0.4 million consumers received average bills due to faulty meters.

However, the power division had contested this inquiry, claiming that only 0.2 million consumers were overcharged.
NEPRA, standing firm on its inquiry claims, issued directives to XWDiscos and K-Electric to address consumer issues and take action against those involved in the overbilling scam. These companies failed to provide a satisfactory reply to the inquiry report following widespread complaints in July-August 2023.

NEPRA issued directives to these companies including K-Electric to implement NEPRA’s inquiry report’s recommendation.
According to Nepra’s inquiry report published in December 2023, K-Electric is the only company found using handheld devices for meter readings, which are an effective solution for ensuring transparency in the meter reading and billing process.

The report also found that K-E’s monthly billing cycles follow the regulatory guidelines and has observed no lapse from the company in this regard.

The inquiry report also shows that no customers were found to have been fleeced by a change of slab or deprived of their protected or lifeline status due to an error by K-E in meter reading.

In response to widespread complaints and irregularities in electricity billing practices, the regulatory has issued a comprehensive directive to distribution companies outlining steps for immediate rectification.

It directed DISCOs to adhere to recommendations outlined in the Inquiry Report and GOP inquiry report, particularly focusing on the replacement of defective meters older than two months (July and August 2023).

Consumers will now be charged based on actual readings instead of excessive or averaged bills, ensuring fair billing practices.

DISCOs were instructed to collaborate with the Power Information Technology Company (PITC) to review inflated bills dating back to June 2023.

This review aims to rectify billing discrepancies, especially for protected/lifeline consumers who may have been wrongly categorised due to billing cycle extensions beyond 30 days.

The directive also addresses accountability, requiring DISCOs to take disciplinary action against officers found in violation of regulations. Specifically, HESCO, SEPCO, TESCO, and PESCO are mandated to scrutinise unrecovered detection bills from July 2018 to June 2023 for accuracy and initiate recovery procedures where necessary.

Furthermore, Discos are reminded to strictly adhere to the Consumer Service Manual (CSM) and tariff terms, including meter readings within 30-day billing cycles and accurate issuance of detection bills. Education on relevant regulations and consumer eligibility criteria for Disco officers is also emphasised.

DISCOs are given a one-month deadline to rectify identified discrepancies and submit a compliance report to the regulatory authority. Failure to comply may result in the Authority initiating legal proceedings under relevant regulations.

4,K-P Assembly may meet on Feb 27,ECP yet to announce decision on allocation of reserved seats to SIC,"Delay in the allocation of the reserved seats in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly has pushed back the maiden session of the provincial legislature until next week, as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) mulls over the request of the majority party, the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).

The ECP allocated five reserved seats for women in K-P Assembly to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), while delaying the allocation of remaining 21 reserved seats for women and four for minorities.

The inaugural session of the assemblies has to be called within 21 days after the elections, which makes February 29 the last date. Sources said that initially the session was expected on February 24, but because of the delay on the reserved seats, the session had been pushed back to February 27.

In the province, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed independents swept the elections, gaining a three-fourths majority in the house. However, as per the law, independents could not be allocated any of the reserved seats.
In order to be eligible to get the reserved seats, the PTI decided that their winning candidates would join the SIC and get their share from the 26 reserved seats for women and 4 minorities to further strengthen their position in the 145-strong legislature.

The sources said that the SIC had applied for the allocation of reserved seats and had provided its priority lists, adding that the matter was pending with the ECP. Until the allocation of seats, the inaugural session could not be convened.
Initially, the sources said, the maiden assembly session was proposed on February 24, when the newly-elected members of the provincial assembly were supposed to take oath. Now, according to the sources the house could be convened on February 27.

Meanwhile, the ECP notified the allocation of two reserved seats for women to the JUI -- Rehana Ismail and Asma Alam. Similarly, the PML-N’s Shobia Shahid and Shehla Bano were also notified as the returning candidates on the reserved seats. The one seat allocated to the PPP went to Nilofar Babar.

9,Landslide debris on KKH in Bhasha cleared,Highway opened for all types of traffic,"All types of vehicles have been restored in the Bhasha area of the Upper Kohistan district on Friday after removing debris from the landslide-hit Karakoram Highway (KKH).

Earlier in the day, the highway in Bhasha was opened only for one-way traffic. It was closed after every two hours until 6pm to restore the two-way traffic.

The first closure of the highway in Bhasha took place from 8am to 10am.

It was opened for traffic from 10am to 11pm.

The second time the main artery was shut down in Bhasha was from 12pm to 2pm while it was reopened for traffic from 2pm to 3pm.

The restoration work later continued on the highway from 3pm to 5pm.

The highway was completely opened for traffic from 6pm onwards.

Thousands of passengers, who were stuck on both sides since two days, said the work of removing the debris in Bhasha was very slow.

These passengers included elderly people, children, and women who were unable to continue towards their destinations and spent the two days in extremely harsh weather conditions without the facilities of food or accommodation.

Making matter worse, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Friday issued an advisory to all provincial authorities expecting thunderstorms forecasted across the country.

According to the NDMA technical team and Met department, a westerly wave is expected to enter the region from February 25 to February 27.

The forecast indicates potential rain, wind, thunderstorms, and snowfall over hilly areas in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat region, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

The advisory warns possible disruptions in roadways in various areas including Murree, Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Neelum valley, Bagh, Poonch, and Haveli during this period.

The advisory highlights the risk of landslides, mudslides, rain spells, and snowfall, leading to potential road blockages in the upper area of K-P, Galiyat region, AJK, and G-B.

The combination of snowfall and rain is expected to result in a significant drop in temperatures.

In Balochistan and southern Punjab, heavy rainfall is expected that might trigger flash flooding in the nullahs there. The advisory alerts about the potential for landslides and mudslides, leading to road blockages because of isolated rain spells.

The NDMA has urged all provincial disaster management authorities, Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, State Disaster Management Authority, the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, National Highway Authority, National Highways and Motorway Police, Frontier Works Organisation, Rescue 1122, dam authorities, line departments, ministries, and federal agencies to undertake necessary measures in line with their respective mandates.
