0,Protest outside Sindh Assembly today,"GDA, JUI-F, JI, PTI say demonstration against rigging will be peaceful","The Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), JUI-F, Jamaat-e-Islami, and PTI have jointly announced a protest in front of the Sindh Assembly on February 24. The coalition affirmed that the protest, against alleged election rigging, will be peaceful. However, they warn that any attempt to interfere with the protest will be resisted.
A 10-member advisory committee comprising members from all five political parties will be formed which will strategise the future course of action.
Sadruddin Shah Rashidi, Chief Coordinator of GDA Sindh, revealed these plans during a press conference on Friday. He was accompanied by Maulana Rashid Mahmood Soomro of JUI-F Sindh, Hafiz Naeemur Rahman of Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi, and Haleem Adil Shaikh of the PTI Sindh.
In a consultative meeting held earlier, suggestions against the alleged election rigging were discussed, leading to the decision to form a 10-member committee representing the five allies. The committee will chart the future roadmap, with the understanding that the peaceful protest will persist until they claim the allegedly stolen public mandate.
While speaking at the press conference, Rashidi emphasised that their protest movement is directed against the perceived electoral malpractice. He mentioned that Pir Pagara, the head of GDA and PML-Functional, would step forward when needed.
Dr Safdar Ali Abbasi highlighted that his party was protesting against the fraudulent election across Sindh. He mentioned successful sit-ins in Jamshoro and Moro, stressing that the people had rejected the results of the alleged bogus election. 
The joint protest in front of the Sindh Assembly on February 24 at 11am is a united announcement from all five parties, signifying a peaceful struggle. Dr Safdar Abbasi stated that the coalition leaders would convene for a meeting after the protest to discuss the future plan.
Responding to a question, he confirmed that Jamaat-e-Islami, PTI members, and GDA would not take the oath on the following day. Hafiz Naeemur Rahman of Jamaat-e-Islami also expressed solidarity, stating that their members would be sworn in later.
Haleem Adil Shaikh of the PTI joined the discourse, claiming a robbery of the mandate in all divisions of Sindh. He alleged rigging in Karachi, Hyderabad, and voiced concerns over the local government election. 
According to Shaikh, the PTI has 22 MNA seats in Sindh in reality. He accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of treason against the Constitution, emphasising their commitment to stand by the opposition.
In a closing statement, Allama Rashid Mahmood Soomro warned against blocking the peaceful protest, holding those responsible for any consequences. He recalled the presence of Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Bhutto in the Islamabad protest, asserting that if a protest could happen there, it could also take place outside the Sindh Assembly.
