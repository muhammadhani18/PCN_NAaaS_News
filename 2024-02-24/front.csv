0,MQM-P weighs joining opposition if demands not met,It might contemplate joining the government if PML-N gives reply on its three-point agenda,"The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has categorically denied engaging in any power-sharing negotiations at the moment, asserting that it has initially sought positions from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) regarding the implementation of their three-point agenda.
The party states that if the PML-N provides a satisfactory response, they may contemplate joining the government; otherwise, they are prepared to sit on the opposition benches.
A MQM-P delegation, led by Dr Farooq Sattar, Mustafa Kamal and Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, held talks with PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, who is also a prime ministerial candidate for the majority party.
Media reports suggest that the discussions revolved around a power-sharing formula encompassing the governorship of Sindh, legal matters, Karachi’s development and allocation of funds.
Speculation was rife that MQM sought Kamran Tessori’s continuation as the governor of Sindh as part of the proposed power-sharing arrangement.
The meeting was mainly attended by PML-N leader Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazir Tarar, Rana Mahud, Rana Sanaullah and Ata Tarar. The meeting concluded without reaching a consensus, leading to expectations of another round later in the day, though both sides remained tight-lipped until the filing of this report.
According to an official statement, Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged MQM's role during the no-confidence motion against PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Kha and in averting default. The statement emphasised the leaders' commitment to working together for the nation's prosperity, prioritising national interest over personal concerns.
MQM Convener Khalid Maqbool Saddique vehemently rejected the impression of his party seeking federal ministries from PML-N. He clarified that the delegation met the nominated prime minister to gauge his stance on their three-point agenda, centred around devolving power and funds to the grassroots level.
He said that they were not yearning for any ministries, even during Shehbaz Sharif‘s last stint, they asked him to keep their ministries with him, as for them their principles were more important than any ministries.
He said that, however, then PML-N needed them to keep its government intact now this was not the case. They have the numbers, and can even function without their support.
He said that they would not join the government without assurance of implementation of their agenda.
Responding to queries about the number of ministries MQM would expect, he stated they would seek ministries based on a share.
Regarding the demand for governorship, he emphasised the need to understand PML-N's position before entering negotiations for such a position.
When queried about PPP's backing for PML-N at the centre, which meant that the latter might incline towards PPP in the event of a disagreement between the two parties, he said that destiny appears to have steered them away from the power centre.
The MQM delegation also convened with PML-Q chief Chaudhary Shujaat and other leaders of his party at his residence in Lahore, where the two sides deliberated on the prevailing political scenario and the process of government formation.
On the other hand, PML-Q leader Chaudhary Salik Hussain also met with the nominated prime minister at his residence. Much like MQM, PML-Q was also seeking ministerial positions in the incoming government of Shehbaz Sharif.
Although PML-Q, unlike MQM, has an even thinner presence in the National Assembly and numerically contributes little to the discussion from its end, in contrast to MQM, which boasts 17 elected members in the house.
Though PML-Q unlike MQM with even a thinner presence in the National Assembly, numerically bring nothing to the table from its end as opposed to MQM which has 17 elected members in the house.
Shehbaz was also called on by IPP President Aleem Khan, whose party too failed to grab any respectable share in the NA despite a large number of PTI defectors taken to be electables sent to its party by the establishment.
IPP too only managed to get three seats, which includes the two controversial victories of Aleem Khan himself and Awn Chaudhry.
Separately, a delegation of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) led by its President Khalid Hussain Magsi met with Shehbaz.
The delegation included Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani and Senator Kauda Babar.
Issues related to the country's situation and political cooperation were discussed in the meeting.
The delegation congratulated Shehbaz on being nominated as the prime minister.
Shehbaz appreciated the support of BAP during the 16-month coalition government.
The leaders agreed to promote unity and political cooperation to counter future economic threats to the country, noting that political stability was essential to deal with economic risks.
They agreed to move ahead with political unity and cooperation keeping in mind the country's interests. “Protecting Pakistan from economic threats is the duty of every patriot.”

1,ECP distributes 45 NA reserved seats,Holds back notification on possible share of SIC,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday notified the allocation of 38 reserved seats for women and seven for minorities to political parties but held back its decision on the remaining 22 women’s seats and three minorities.
According to the notification, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) was given 19 women’s seats and four minorities – making it the largest party in the National Assembly with 107 seats – followed by 12 women's seats and two minorities to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) got four women’s seats and one minority. Other parties—Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), the PML-Quaid, and the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) — were allocated one seat each.
The allocation has been made from the reserved quota for Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan.
The ECP withheld the allocation of 12 seats for women from Punjab and 10 seats from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), besides three seats reserved for minorities, which would be announced later.
After the Feb 8 elections, the largest group of the newly elected lawmakers in the National Assembly belonged to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed independents. However, as per the law, independents could not be allocated any of the reserved seats.
In order to be eligible for the reserved seats, the PTI decided that their lawmakers would join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
As per their strength in the National Assembly, the SIC could claim 22 women’s seats and three minorities’, however, the ECP’s decision on the SIC request remains pending.
The National Assembly has 60 reserved seats for women – 32 from Punjab, 14 Sindh, 10 K-P and four Balochistan – and 10 reserved seats for minorities.
Of these, the ECP notified the allocation of 20 seats of Punjab, 14 of Sindh, four of Balochistan and seven minorities.
In Punjab, the PML-N got 17 women’s seats, besides one seat each went to the PPP, PML-Quaid, and the IPP. From Sindh’s quota, the PPP got 10 and the MQM got four. From Balochistan’s share, two seats went to the PML-N and one each to the PPP and the JUI.
From the reserved seats for minorities, the PML-N got four, the PPP two and the MQM one. They are PML-N’s Kesho Mal, Dr Darshan, Nelson Azim and Isfandiar Bhandara; PPP’s Ramesh Lal and Naveed Aamir, and the MQM’s Mahan Manjiani.
Prominent lawmakers on women’s seats include Tahira Aurangzeb, Maryam Aurangzeb, Shaista Pervez, Nuzhat Sadiq, Masrat Asif Khawaja, Seema Mohiuddin, Shiza Khawaja, Tasmina Khurshid, Wajiha Qamar, Zeb Jafar, Kiran Imran, Anusha Rehman, Zahra Wadood Fatemi, Asia Naz Tanoli and Saba Sadiq of the PML-N, besides PPP's Hina Rabbani Khar, IPP's Munnaza Hasan, and PML-Q’s Farrukh Khan.
With the allocation of the reserved seats, the PML-N is the largest party in the National Assembly with 107 lawmakers. However, in case the ECP allocated the remaining seats to the SIC, it would become the largest party in the lower house of parliament with 113 lawmakers.
The PPP remains in the third place with 68 seats, and the MQM, with 22 seats, is in the fourth place. There are nine PTI-backed independents, who did not join any political party. The JUI’s strength is seven, followed by the PML-Q’s five, and the IPP’s four seats.
Besides, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), the National Party (NP), Majlis-e-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM), the PML-Zia, Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) and the Balochistan National Party (BNP) have one seat each.
Meanwhile, the ECP notified the success of independent candidate Iqbal Khan from NA-27, independent candidate Shahid Ahmed from NA-38, Maulana Misbahuddin of the JUI from NA-40, and Dawar Khan Kundi from NA-43.
The ECP also issued notification of six successful candidates of the Balochistan Assembly and one independent candidate Mahmood Qadir Khan, from PP-289 Dera Ghazi Khan. The ECP suspended the notification of independent candidate Arqam Khan from PP-68 Gujranwala.

2,Legal matters: PTI’s strategy on ‘polls rigging’ flawed,Party’s Sher Afzal Marwat files plea through lawyer who has bad blood with CJ Isa,"Although the state institutions are unwilling to address the grievances of its candidates, there are also apparently flaws in the legal strategy of the PTI in dealing with the issue of alleged election rigging.
The choice of lawyers is always significant to acquire relief in any constitutional matter.
Usually political parties and leaders hire lawyers with good reputation among judges.
Ideally, judges should not have a personal liking or disliking, but it is a fact that some lawyers are able to receive a better right to audience from the bench on account of their reputation.
Now PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat has filed a constitutional petition through Advocate Riaz Hanif Rahi seeking a probe into the allegations of polls rigging through the formation of a judicial commission.
Advocate Rahi had challenged the appointment of incumbent CJP Qazi Faez Isa as the chief justice of the Balochistan High Court during the tenure of former top judge Saqib Nisar.
The plea was scheduled before a bench but later rejected as there were serious concerns raised by lawyers about the listing of this matter in an open court.
Later during the tenure of ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Rahi had moved a contempt petition against Justice Isa and two high court CJs over the violation of the apex court larger bench’s July 26, 2023 order wherein the notification for the audio leaks commission was suspended.
Soon after filing the contempt petition, Rahi remained absent. Subsequently, he withdrew his contempt petition. The then CJP Bandial had also urged him to show patience in the prevailing political situation.
In the backdrop of this background, senior lawyers are wondering about engaging the services of Rahi for this matter.
They are questioning whether or not Rahi's engagement was deliberate to achieve some motive.
Interestingly, a senior PTI leader did not confirm that Marwat had filed the petition after consulting with the party.
It has been learnt that PTI candidates Salman Akram Raja and Shoaib Shaheen are preparing a constitutional petition on the subject.
Both are claiming that they won the elections from their respective constituencies as per Form 45, which was in their possession. This petition is likely to be filed next week.
Shaheen has already written a letter to CJP Isa on the subject.
Another PTI candidate Shaukat Basra also tried to raise this issue before a bench led by CJP Isa. Subsequently, he held a news conference, questioning the role of the judiciary in the elections.
PTI supporters are disappointed with CJP Isa's role in the polls process, especially after the SC’s January 13 order wherein the party’s internal elections were declared illegal and it was deprived of its popular electoral symbol of the ‘ cricket bat’.
Later, the PTI -- disheartened by the decision -- decided to withdraw its contempt petition over the violation of the court’s order for providing a level playing field to the party in the run-up to the elections.
Throughout the electoral process, the SC led by CJP Isa did not question the executive authorities for ensuring free and fair polls. Now, the PTI is struggling to acquire reserved seats as its candidates contested the elections independently.
CJP Isa had discussed the PTI's 2014 marathon sit-in in the Faizabad Dharna case judgment issued in February 2019.
Following this judgment, the PTI challenged the case’s verdict, while the party-led government filed a presidential reference against the judge, accusing him of financial misconduct.
While the Supreme Judicial Council was holding proceedings on the misconduct complaint, PTI supporters were running a malicious campaign against Justice Isa and his family members, apparently at the behest of the ‘powerful circles’, according to some analysts.
During the term of former CJP Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Isa had taken notice of PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan’s participation in a lawyers’ convention organised by the party’s legal wing in Islamabad.
However, the apex court ruled in February 2021 that Justice Isa should not hear cases involving Imran, who was the prime minister back then.
It has become clear from Justice Isa's observations that he has serious concerns about last year’s May 9 riots.
The SC under CJP Isa did not entertain senior lawyer and politician Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan's plea in connection with the alleged enforced disappearance of PTI leaders, as well as Imran’s letter about their harassment.
Presently, there is a cordial relationship between the state institutions.
CJP Isa has so far not made any observation about the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) conduct during the polls.
It is also a fact that the PTI can never be granted any relief on the issue of alleged polls rigging as long as the state institutions are on the same page.
