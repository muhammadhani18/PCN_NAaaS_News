0,Dues to Chinese IPPs hit record $1.8b,"Outstanding dues up by 77% in seven months, complicating ties with Beijing","The outstanding dues of power projects of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have alarmingly increased to a record Rs493 billion or $1.8 billion as of last month, showing an increase of over three-fourths in a span of just seven months.
The massive surge in the dues of the Chinese energy projects during the time of the caretaker government may become a serious issue for Pakistan in managing its economic relations with Beijing.
Sources told The Express Tribune that as of end January, Pakistan owed around Rs493 billion to Chinese power generation and transmission projects. The amount is Rs214 billion or 77% higher than June last year, according to the sources.
The major reason behind the surge in the dues was the failure of the Power Division to settle at least 90% of the monthly claims filed by these power generation and transmission projects. The sources said that for the month of June, the power plants had submitted Rs110 billion worth of claims. But the Power Division settled less than Rs60 billion or about 53% of the monthly claims.
Last month, China linked the approval of a $600 million new foreign commercial loan with the prior settlement of the debt that Pakistan owes to the Chinese power plants. It was rare on the part of any country to link a foreign commercial loan with any prior action, indicating resentment in the Chinese camps.
Pakistan had requested the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Bank of China for a total loan of $600 million. Each bank had been approached for $300 million in financing. Pakistan’s authorities had hoped that they would get the loans in December.
Under the Energy Framework Agreement of the CPEC, Pakistan had committed to setting up a revolving fund and depositing an amount equal to 21% of the invoices generated for power payments. The 21% is the sum that the Pakistani authorities fail to collect, adding to the vicious power sector circular debt. The arrangement had been sought to protect Chinese firms from circular debt.
But instead of setting up a fund, Pakistan in October 2022 opened a Pakistan Energy Revolving Account (PERA) at the State Bank of Pakistan with Rs48 billion in annual allocations with a condition to withdraw a maximum of Rs4 billion per month. As a result, the Chinese IPPs’ debt is now hovering around Rs400 billion.
The sources said that the government has again allowed settling only Rs4 billion of the Chinese energy debt in February, indicating that it does not see any urgency to solve the dispute. The Rs4 billion monthly allocations are not sufficient to settle the monthly inflow, leaving the stock unsettled.

The report showed that out of Rs493 billion, Pakistan owed Rs97 billion to the imported-coal fired Sahiwal power plant – the highest obligation to any Chinese energy project that also represents one-fifth of the Chinese outstanding energy dues.
Islamabad also owed over Rs82 billion to the coal-fired Hub power project, Rs80 billion to the coal-fired Port Qasim power plant, and Rs79 billion to the Thar Coal project.
The Chinese government, through Pakistan’s embassy in Beijing and its own embassy in Islamabad, has multiple times raised this issue at all forums.
Due to huge outstanding liabilities, Chinese insurance company M/s Sinosure is also not providing any fresh lending to power sector projects in Pakistan. The Chinese government had also raised this issue with the last Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government.
Overdue payments to the Chinese Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are causing huge concern among Chinese businesses. Former Special Assistant to PM on Foreign Affairs, Tariq Fatemi, had written to the planning ministry a few months ago.
China, in the past, had also raised the issue of Pakistan’s overall public debt unsustainability and its implications for obtaining $6 billion to $7 billion new loans for the Mainline-I railways project of the CPEC.
The details showed that the receivables of Engro PowerGen plant increased to Rs57 billion by the end of January. The country also owed Rs32 billion to the sponsors of the Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line project. Likewise, Karot power project receivables have surged to Rs23 billion by the end of last month.
The payables to Thar coal energy limited and ThalNova have increased over Rs7 billion. The UEP power plant receivables have crossed Rs5 billion. The receivables of the rest of the energy projects of the CPEC ranged from Rs2 billion to Rs4.5 billion.
This month the International Monetary Fund did not approve the Rs1.27 trillion circular debt reduction plan. The IMF objected to the government’s proposal on the grounds that it carried serious fiscal risks, as it also rejected the proposal of issuing Rs745 billion additional supplementary grant.

1,‘Agriculture key to addressing woes’,SBP deputy governor announces central bank’s new project to support small farmers,"State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Deputy Governor, Saleem Ullah has stated that the share of agricultural products in Pakistan’s imports is $10 billion. If agriculture, livestock, and fisheries are developed, $8 to $9 billion can be easily saved, while keeping prices at a reasonable level to reduce inflation.
He stressed that the development of agriculture is the solution to many economic problems faced by Pakistan. The SBP is fostering its role in promoting and developing the agriculture sector.
Under this project, the provision of financing to small farmers will be facilitated and their productivity will also be improved, he said.
As a special guest at the opening ceremony of the four-day DALFA (Dairy, Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and Advanced Technology) Cattle Show, held from Feb 22 to 25 at Karachi Expo Centre, Saleem Ullah commended the organisers for the successful conduct of the show. However, he noted that unfortunately, the agriculture sector in Pakistan has not received the attention it deserves

Read Steps proposed to achieve 5% annual agri-growth
The deputy governor stated that the development of the agriculture sector could address several crucial problems in Pakistan’s economy, including limited economic development growth, inflation, unemployment, and food security.
The SBP, with a special focus on agriculture development, is working on a new project set to be introduced in the next two to three months. This project aims to facilitate access to financial facilities for small farmers, 75% of whom often resort to non-traditional methods due to stringent conditions imposed by traditional financial services.
In the new agriculture development plan, increasing the productivity of small farmers is the second priority. Collaboration with various stakeholders will facilitate the supply of agricultural inputs, recognising that small farmers lack the ability to pay market prices, resulting in lower productivity compared to national averages. Progressive farmers, on the other hand, exhibit nearly double the productivity.
He urged other institutions to collaborate with the SBP and financial institutions to collectively address the challenges faced by small farmers.

2,Rupee falls after dip in reserves,Stands at Rs279.36 to a dollar in inter-bank market,"The stabilising Pakistani currency on Friday ticked down Rs0.03 to Rs279.36 to a dollar in the inter-bank market apparently due to higher demand for foreign currency compared to its supply in the national economy.
The rupee dropped after the central bank reported a day ago that Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves fell $44 million to $8.01 billion in the week ended February 16, 2024 because of foreign debt repayments.
The currency has cumulatively appreciated 9.93%, or Rs27.74, in the past five and a half months since diving to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
In the open market, the rupee resumed its downturn after a day of slight gains, losing Rs0.08 on a day-on-day basis to close at Rs282.24/$, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.

Read Rupee falls to 3-week low against dollar
The currency has dropped a net Rs1.23 in the past 10 days in the retail market. Consequently, the gap between currency values in the two markets further widened to Rs2.88 (or 1.03%). The difference was gradually broadening towards the maximum limit of 1.25% (around Rs4 at current levels) recommended by the IMF under its loan programme.
The currency markets, however, ignored the critical developments that took place in the past one day where the IMF exhibited its willingness to work with the incoming government in the Centre while ignoring the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) call to show its reaction over alleged rigging in results of general elections.
Government officials claim that the size of the next IMF programme will be around $6 billion, as compared to the current short-term standby arrangement of $3 billion, to ensure hassle-free repayment of foreign debt and build a safe cushion, which will clear the way for liberalisation of economic activities in the medium to long run.
An IMF team will visit Pakistan to conduct a second review under the ongoing programme, which is ending in March-April 2024.

3,"Inflation spikes on food, energy costs",Tomato and diesel prices surge leading to 0.04% rise in SPI,"The weekly inflation reading ticked up 0.04% due to a hike in food and energy prices in the week ending February 22, ending the downturn recorded in the past three consecutive weeks. According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics’ (PBS) data, the inflation reading decelerated to a 13-week low at 30.68% for the week compared to the same week last year, but it still remained elevated as many essential commodities continued to become expensive for various reasons, significantly squeezing people’s purchasing power.
The bureau reported that tomatoes recorded the single largest increase of 22.71% in a week to Rs132.54/kg compared to Rs108.01/kg in the previous week. It was followed by bananas, which increased by 7.40% to Rs136.38/dozen in the week compared to Rs126.98/dozen in the prior week. The price of high-speed diesel went up by 3.02% to Rs288.39/litre compared to Rs279.93/litre. Chicken farm broiler (live) prices increased by 1.22% to Rs454.94/kg in the week under review compared to Rs449.54/kg in the last week. Other commodities saw price increases in the range of 0.14-1%, including petrol, sugar, mutton, beef, curd, pulse moong, firewood, and georgette, according to the bureau.

Read Gas price surge expected to propel inflation to 25%
During the week, out of 51 items, prices of 23 (45.10%) items increased, 8 (15.69%) items decreased, and 20 (39.21%) items remained unchanged. The year-on-year trend depicts an increase of 30.68%, with gas charges for Q1 increasing by 480%, tomatoes becoming costlier by 199.93%, and chili powder prices spiking by 81.74%. Other commodities shot up in the range of 34-66%, including wheat flour, gents sponge chappal, gents sandal, sugar, gur, salt powdered, garlic, and energy saver.
The latest increase in gas and petroleum product prices in February 2024 by the government are expected to keep the inflation rate on the higher side in the short run, but it is hoped to start sharply decelerating in the weeks and months to come due to the high base effect. A local research house estimated that the gas price hike would take inflation up by 43 basis points to 24.91% in FY24 full year. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has revised up its projection for the benchmark monthly inflation reading (CPI index) to 23-25% in late January 2024 for FY24 compared to its July 2023 forecast for 20-22% for the year. It revised the projection following the first gas price hike announced in November 2023, stating that the impact of the rise on the inflation rate was higher than its estimates.
Local brokerage houses have estimated the rate for the outgoing month of February at around 24%.

4,Oil prices dip as Fed hints at delayed rate cuts,"Indications of healthy fuel demand, supply concerns could revive prices","Oil prices fell more than 2% on Friday and were on track for a weekly decline after the US central bank indicated that interest rate cuts could be delayed by at least two more months.
Brent crude futures were down $1.89, or 2.3%, at $81.78 a barrel at 1700 GMT, and US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.88, or 2.4%, to $76.73.
For the week, Brent is set to decline about 2% and the US benchmark is on track to fall about 3%. However, indications of healthy fuel demand and supply concerns could revive prices in the coming days.
US Federal Reserve policymakers should delay interest rate cuts by at least another couple of months, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Thursday, which could slow economic growth and curb oil demand.
“The entire energy complex is reacting, because if inflation begins to come back it will slow demand for energy products,” said Tim Snyder, economist at Matador Economics.
“That is not something the market wants to digest right now, especially as it is trying to figure out a direction,” he added.

Read Oil rises 1%, heads for weekly gain
Some analysts, however, say demand has remained largely healthy despite the impact of high interest rates, including in the US.
JPMorgan’s demand indicators are showing oil demand rising by 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) month over month through February 21, its analysts said in a note on Friday.
“This compares to a 1.6 million bpd increase observed during the prior week, likely benefiting from increased travel demand in China and Europe,” the analysts said.
The Fed has held its policy rate steady in a 5.25% to 5.5% range since last July. Minutes of its meeting last month show most central bankers were worried about moving too quickly to ease policy.
Waller also pushed back on the idea that the Fed risks sending the economy into recession if it waits too long to cut rates, saying the Fed can afford to “wait a little longer”.

5,Stocks soar over easing of political noise,"KSE-100 index climbs 901.48 points, settles at 62,815.82","Shares trading at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday reflected growing economic stability and investor confidence, which emerged as major influencing factors when political uncertainty gradually died down, leading to an increase of around 900 points in the KSE-100 index.
Moreover, the surge came as a Bloomberg report quoted a government official as saying that Pakistan had planned to seek a new loan of at least $6 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help the incoming government repay billions of dollars in debt.
Though the index exhibited subdued trading at the outset, it swiftly started rising and stood at elevated levels at midday amid some fluctuations. The market touched its intra-day high of 62,945.37 points about half an hour before close, apparently driven by the IMF spokesperson’s assertion that the fund was looking forward “to working with the new government” of Pakistan.
“Stocks closed sharply higher after Punjab MPAs were sworn in which reduced political noise, and the IMF’s affirmation of working with Pakistan’s new government to ensure macroeconomic stability,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Reports saying the new government will likely seek at least $6 billion in a new IMF programme and negotiate the Extended Fund Facility to avert economic crisis played the role of catalysts in bullish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded impressive gains of 901.48 points, or 1.46%, and settled at 62,815.82.
Topline Securities observed in a report that continuing its momentum, the KSE-100 index gained 901 points. “This positivity can be attributed to the start of the process of forming a provincial government as the Punjab Assembly held its first session,” it said.
Similarly, the Sindh Assembly will hold its session on Saturday where the elected representatives will take oath. These developments boosted investor confidence as things were moving smoothly towards political stability, Topline said.
“News that Pakistan intends to seek at least $6 billion from the IMF to repay the debt due this year and the IMF’s statement that it intends to work with the new government to help in macroeconomic stability provided further stimulus to the market,” it added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote in its report that the PSX witnessed a strong close to the week through initial resistance at 62k. “Week-on-week, the KSE-100 index gained 5.04% as political temperature cooled down,” it said.
Oil and Gas Development Company (+7.5%), Pakistan Petroleum (+4.61%) and Meezan Bank (+3.74%) contributed the most to the index’s gains.
Habib Bank (+0.73%) announced results for 4QCY23 where it posted earnings per share of Rs10.12, up 39% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter. It declared a dividend of Rs4 per share, taking total CY23 payout to Rs9.75 (CY22 – Rs6.75).
The jump in earnings came mainly on the back of growth in total revenue, AHL said. It anticipated that in the coming week, the index level may reach closer to 63-64k, which would close the gap that had emerged following elections.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the bourse continued with its positive momentum. The KSE-100 closed the day with gains of 901 points.
“We expect the uptrend to continue and recommend investors to view any downtrend as an opportunity to buy stocks in the banking, cement and exploration and production sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 377.97 million shares against Thursday’s tally of 324.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs16 billion.
Shares of 339 companies were traded. Of these, 201 stocks closed higher, 118 dropped and 20 remained unchanged.
Kohinoor Spinning was the volume leader with trading in 36.2 million shares, gaining Rs1 to close at Rs4.59. It was followed by K-Electric with 26.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.19 to close at Rs4.39 and Yousuf Weaving with 16.7 million shares, gaining Rs0.74 to close at Rs4.12.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs626.8 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,Saudi Arabia positions itself as AI hub,PIF governor highlights kingdom’s potential outside of the US,"The head of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) on Thursday pitched the kingdom as a prospective hub for artificial intelligence activity outside the United States, citing its energy resources and funding capacity.
“We are fairly well positioned to be an AI hub outside of the US,” said PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, speaking at a Miami investment event sponsored by the sovereign wealth fund.
“AI will consume a lot of energy and we are the global leader when it comes to fossil fuel energy and when it comes to renewable energy,” he said.
Rumayyan said Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil producer, also had the “political will” to make AI projects happen and ample funds it could deploy to nurture the technology’s development.
His comments signal that data centres may be a core part of Riyadh’s strategy to capitalise on booming demand for generative AI technology, which requires vast amounts of processing power.

Read Ethical use of AI in academia discussed
AI technology uses clusters of thousands of chips in massive data centres to train algorithms to complete tasks. Tech companies’ electricity costs have spiked as they compete to build increasingly sophisticated AI models and roll out generative products to billions of users.
Rumayyan said PIF was allocating more than 70% of the fund to projects and investments inside Saudi Arabia and was targeting an international allocation of 20% to 25% moving forward. About 40% of the fund’s international investments were in the United States, he said.
PIF was deploying about $40 billion to $50 billion annually and would increase that to $70 billion a year between 2025 and 2030, he said.
Previously, major stock markets in the Gulf dropped in early trade on Thursday as minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting cemented bets the central bank will not cut interest rates soon.

7,Cotton yarn exports to China surge 47%,Pakistan exported yarn worth $696 million in 2023,"China’s import of cotton yarn from Pakistan reached a record high of $695.62 million during the year 2023, marking a significant surge of 46.7%, data from China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Textile and Apparel (CCCT) showed.
Recently, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) released a report which stated that due to the sharp rise in energy prices, and power and gas supply interruptions, more than a thousand textile factories have stopped production, and the decline in production capacity has affected the demand for intermediate goods.
According to CCCT, due to the large price difference between domestic and foreign cotton yarns after the second quarter, the importers’ intention to order continued to rise, resulting in the recent arrival of imported yarn, which pushed up imports.
Among them, India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan increased their exports of cotton yarn to China by 243.2%, 351.1% and 867.1% respectively last December. For the whole year, cotton yarn from Pakistan accounted for 15.8% of China’s cotton yarn imports.

Read Textile exports surge to $1.46b
According to statistics from the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China (GACC), the total value of yarn imports and exports in 2023 came in at $19.68 billion, a decrease of 2.9% year-on-year.
Among them, exports stood at $13.7 billion, down 8.6% year-on-year, imports amounted to $5.98 billion, up 13.2% year-on-year and in quantity terms imports were 2.043 million tons, up 32.6% year-on-year.
Out of the yarn imported from across the globe, cotton yarn is the most important category, accounting for 70% of the yarn imports and 24% of the textile and clothing imports.
China’s demand for imported cotton and cotton yarn continues to increase. From January to December 2023, the cumulative import of cotton yarn reached 1.687 million tons, an increase of 43.4% year-on-year.

8,Businessmen fear hefty job losses,Cost of doing business becomes unbearable due to high energy tariffs,"Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, while expressing deep concern over the rising cost of doing business due to unbearable energy tariffs, has voiced fears that the day is not far when thousands of jobless people will take to the streets to protest against the government’s policies.
Without taking care of the plight of the poor, who have been reeling from soaring inflation for the past couple of years, the government has kept on increasing gas and electricity tariffs, which resulted in the closure of hundreds of industrial units as well as small and medium enterprises in Karachi and the rest of the country, a statement quoted the KCCI president as saying on Friday.
He cautioned that such a situation would leave a devastating impact on Pakistan’s economy as production activities were shrinking, exports were going down and unemployment was rising.

Read Industries at risk as energy costs surge
“We hope that the lawmakers in Islamabad will realise the gravity of the situation and immediately take steps to save industries from permanent closure,” he added.
Despite assurances by the energy minister and other high-ups, the KCCI chief pointed out, not a single step had been taken to reduce the cost of doing business, which terribly shattered the confidence of industrialists. Keeping that in view, the businessmen are now seriously looking forward to shifting their production units somewhere else where they could peacefully run their factories in a conducive environment.

9,Govt gets only $9.2b in foreign loans,"Borrowing made for budget and balance of payments support, project financing","Pakistan received a little over $9 billion in foreign loans during the first seven months of the current fiscal year, an amount that was barely enough to meet its financing needs and could not take foreign exchange reserves into double digits.
The Economic Affairs Division on Friday reported the latest disbursement figures for July-January of fiscal year 2023-24, days after the Ministry of Finance revised downward its foreign loans projection by 35%.
The data reported by the Economic Affairs Division and the central bank showed that Pakistan secured $9.2 billion in foreign loans during the first seven months of FY24. Pakistan also secured $6 billion in deposit rollovers from Saudi Arabia, China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), taking total external sector inflows to $15.1 billion, or 60% of its total needs.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has now revised Pakistan’s gross financing requirement to $25 billion on the back of a low current account deficit and the restructuring of $1.2 billion in Chinese-guaranteed debt.
The country received these loans in the shape of budget and balance of payments support as well as project financing. In the month of January, Pakistan received over $1 billion after the IMF released a $706 million loan tranche.
But the gross foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank remained around $8 billion despite purchasing $2 billion from the domestic market.
The finance ministry remained unsuccessful in getting even a dollar in the shape of foreign commercial loans during the first seven months of the current fiscal year. The annual budget estimate on account of commercial loans stands at $4.5 billion.
China has linked its financing of $600 million with the prior settlement plan for Rs493 billion that Pakistan owes to the Chinese power plants.
Another Chinese commercial loan worth $1 billion is maturing in June and Pakistan is seeking its rollover.
Pakistan’s government received only $167 million from multilateral creditors in January, taking the total tally to $2.4 billion for the current fiscal year. The government still expects to receive $5.2 billion from the multilateral creditors during the current year.
The World Bank was the largest lender after the IMF as it disbursed $1.17 billion in seven months. The IMF has given $1.9 billion out of a $3 billion loan package.

Read Pakistan to seek $6b in new IMF loan
The Asian Development Bank gave loans of only $611 million in seven months.
Pakistan has not been successful in getting Geneva pledges fully materialised for the victims of 2022 floods. The Islamic Development Bank has disbursed only $200 million in this fiscal year.
The bilateral lenders extended just $734 million in loans during the July-January period, excluding rollovers. Saudi Arabia gave the highest amount of $595 million under the oil financing facility.
Pakistan also received $595 million from overseas Pakistanis as investment in the Naya Pakistan Certificates.
The Ministry of Finance has this week revised its projections of borrowing from both domestic and external sources. The reliance on domestic sources has substantially increased due to the reluctance of foreign lenders to give new financing due to the country’s poor credit rating despite being under the IMF umbrella.
The Ministry of Finance has slashed the projection of foreign inflows from $17.7 billion to $11.4 billion, a downward adjustment of $6.3 billion, according to the new Annual Borrowing Plan.
The revision has mainly been made on account of projections for Eurobonds and foreign commercial loans.
The Ministry of Finance has dropped plans to float $1.5 billion worth of Eurobonds. It has also cut the estimate of receiving $4.5 billion in foreign commercial loans to just around $2.5 billion.
The report showed the projected inflows from both commercial sources and others category at $3.1 billion. This includes rollover of $1 billion in Chinese commercial loans maturing in June.
A $2 billion worth of Chinese debt is maturing on March 23 and the prime minister has already requested Beijing to roll over the debt. The loan has been obtained at a very high rate of 7.1%.
