0,‘Why isn’t organic fertiliser being utilised?’,Integration of organic fertilisers with soil chemical nutrition could reverse degradation process,"Addressing the shortage of inorganic fertilisers, agricultural experts and researchers stressed the need for the inclusion of organic fertilisers with soil chemical nutrition. This integration could reverse the degradation process and enhance crop yield in a sustainable way.
They said that growers avoid using organic fertilisers because the nutrient concentration of indigenous/organic fertiliser is low. To fulfil the nutrient requirements of current high-yield varieties, these fertilisers would be needed in bulk quantity. Additionally, the release of nutrients from organic fertilisers upon decomposition is a slow and time-dependent process.
“Now, the soil has lost its potential to break the stagnancy in increasing crop yield. Around 60% of the world’s soil has been degraded and lost its potential due to various stresses, including climate change. Furthermore, the use of modern fertiliser is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and other global-scale use of resources at unsustainable rates. Soil biodiversity is also at risk due to excessive use of modern chemical fertiliser. The inclusion of organic fertilisers with soil chemical nutrition could reverse the degradation process and enhance crop yield in a sustainable way,” says University of Agriculture Faisalabad Institute of Soil and Environmental Sciences Prof Dr Zahir Ahmad Zahir, who is also President of Soil Science Society of Pakistan (SSSP).
“We have to feed our population using inorganic methods to produce more crops, but we should utilise both organic and inorganic fertilisers for better results. It is difficult to make soil fertile through organic fertilisers immediately due to high temperatures in the country. Pakistan’s lands are called mineral soil,” says Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Dean of Faculty of Crop Production Prof Dr Inayatullah Rajpar.
“We call for capacity building of growers who are not more aware of soil patterns as green manuring is better, while application of organic fertiliser gives a long-term benefit, reducing dependence on inorganic fertilisers. Growers must use mixed fertilisers to maintain the health of the soil, while deploying crop rotation to enhance efficiency. Farmers ought to focus on the right sources, including the timing for fertilisers, applying the appropriate method, and an adequate amount of fertilisers. Not every grower is able to purchase costly Urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP), as around 30% of peasants are still using organic manure,” says SAU Department of Soil Sciences Prof Dr Ghulam Murtaza Jamro.
Organic fertilisers
Organic fertilisers include animal manure, poultry manures, press mud, crop residues/straw, bones, wood ashes, wool waste, guano, fish, cotton seed meal, blood meal, feather waste, hair and fur waste, mora meal, beet refuse, scutch, horn and hoof meal, chalk, and marl, etc. The processed/composted forms of old fertilisers available in the Pakistani market include Organic-77, Argi-vet, Sheru, Bazooka, tabarTorr, vigoroot, etc.

Difference between modern and conventional fertilisers
Modern fertilisers are very useful in achieving crops’ optimum yield potential compared to old/conventional fertilisers. The yield difference/gap between modern and conventional fertiliser is up to 50%. If growers achieve the yield of cereal (wheat or maize) up to 60 and 120 mounds per acre with modern fertilisers, the yield with conventional fertilisers will be 50% less. Modern fertilisers are rich sources of nutrients and show a significant increase in crops yield compared to old fertiliser.
In olden days
In the olden days, the materials first utilised by farmers for fertiliser were animal manure, bones, wood ashes, wool waste, guano, fish, cotton seed meal, blood meal, feather waste, hair and fur waste, mora meal, beet refuse, scutch, horn and hoof meal, chalk, and marl.
Side effects of modern or chemical fertilisers
Modern fertilisers are prepared from nutrient-concentrated materials, so their losses (60-70% at the field scale) in terms of volatilisation/fixation/precipitation/leaching are high in the soil, sediment, air, and water. Besides polluting the environment, they also disturb ecosystem stability and functioning. The production process of these synthetic fertilisers is very energy-intensive, making their cost-effectiveness dubious and unaffordable for the farming community, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan.

1,Global bond prices double,"Post IMF, investors express faith in economic reforms, timely debt repayment","Pakistan’s US dollar-denominated global Eurobonds and Sukuk have staged a powerful rally in recent days, suggesting the country has left behind the worst-case scenario of potential default on foreign debt repayments after achieving the International Monetary Fund (IMF) $3 billion loan programme in June 2023.
Global media outlet, Bloomberg, reported Pakistan’s international bonds would continue to hover high in 2024 ahead of the next IMF loan programme acquisition by the country after the current one completes in March 2024.

design: mohsin alam
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported the 10-year Pakistan Government International Bond worth $1 billion, maturing in April 2024, ended the trade at 94.7 cents/unit on Wednesday, which is more than double its price below 50 cents before the IMF programme in June 2023.
While talking to The Express Tribune; AHL, CEO, Shahid Ali Habib said the bond has bottomed out in June after the acquisition of the ongoing loan programme. Later on, the significant cut in the current account deficit in the first half of FY24 since the beginning of the year on July 1, 2023, energy and currency markets reforms, the successful completion of the first review of the domestic economy by the IMF in mid-November, and last but not least the return of stability in rupee-dollar parity; altogether extended their support in improving the country’s external economy and its capacity to make import payments and repay foreign debt on time, he said.
“All the developments improved foreign investors’ confidence in the domestic economy and invited huge interest in the country's rising Eurobonds and Sukuk in global markets,” he said.

The price of Pakistan’s other Eurobonds and Sukuks also improved significantly in the past six months as well, including the 10-year bond worth $500 million maturing in September 2025. It has improved 74% in the past one year to 84.84 cents/unit on Wednesday, according to the research house. The 5-year bond worth $1.3 billion, maturing in April 2026, increased 72% to 70.56 cents. The 10-year bond worth $1.5 billion, maturing in December 2027, surged 71% to 67.62 cents. There are trading eight of Pakistan’s bonds in global markets worth totalling at $7.80 billion. They would mature from April 2024 to April 2051.
Citing investors in the country’s Eurobonds and Sukuks, Bloomberg projected “Pakistan’s dollar bonds will rally for a second year (in 2024) as the government is expected to secure another bailout from the International Monetary Fund.”
UBS Asset Management and William Blair Investment Management see its bonds remaining attractive after almost doubling in 2023. Suleman Rafiq Maniya, an independent wealth manager in Karachi, says gains can be as much as 37% in the next 18 months, it said.
Pakistan succeeded in averting a sovereign default after securing a $3 billion bailout from the IMF in July. The move catapulted the nation’s bonds to rank among the top performers in the world last year. While the gains are expected to moderate, reforms such as raising fuel and electricity prices may open the door for another round of funding.
“They seem committed to this IMF programme, and that is a significant point because it suggests there is a big likelihood for them to get another bailout,” said Johnny Chen, fund manager at William Blair in Singapore. “There is also strong potential for reforms to pick up momentum after the elections.”
Pakistan may seek a fresh loan from the Washington-based lender to nurse its fragile economy, interim finance minister Shamshad Akhtar said in November, reported the media outlet. AHL’s Habib further said the increase in the bond price ahead of its maturity in April 2024 strongly suggests global investors have full confidence in the government to make the due payments on time.
He recalled that State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) successfully paid over $1 billion to global investors against a Eurobond just days before it matured in December 2022. He hoped the government would succeed in acquiring a bigger and longer tenure IMF loan programme once the current one is completed in March 2024. He said the central bank has recently highlighted the domestic economy is showing early signs of recovery. This, along with the expected 4-5% cut in the central bank’s benchmark policy rate to 17-18% by the end of June 2024, will help in turning around the stabilising economy.

3,Rupee hits over two-month high against dollar,"Uptick stemmed from reduction in demand for foreign currency, increase in its supply in banking network","Pakistani currency resumed its uptrend on Wednesday after taking a breather for a day, hitting over two-month high at slightly above Rs281.50 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market.
The uptick stemmed from a reduction in demand for the foreign currency and an increase in its supply in the banking network.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee gained 0.06%, or Rs0.17, to Rs281.72 against the greenback. The currency has cumulatively appreciated 1.39%, or Rs3.92, in the past five weeks.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the local currency edged up 0.03%, or Rs0.11, and closed at Rs282.42/$ in the open market.
Market talk suggests that the currency bounced back after the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported that exports increased 22% year-on-year and hit an 18-month high at $2.84 billion in December 2023, while imports dropped 12% to $4.51 billion.
Read Foreign currency inflow hopes aid rupee’s uptrend
The improvement in balance of trade propped up the rupee against foreign currencies and it rebounded after a nominal drop of 0.01% a day ago.
The currency also got support from a surprise increase of $852 million in the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves, which rose to $7.76 billion, according to the weekly data update.
The currency market had not priced in the growth in forex reserves due to the year-end, which came after some multilateral and bilateral institutions provided funds to Pakistan ahead of the IMF executive board meeting on January 11 for potential approval of the next loan tranche of $700 million. Earlier, the country achieved a staff-level agreement with the IMF at the completion of first review under the ongoing $3 billion loan programme.

4,LTO collections cross Rs1tr for first time,"Karachi tax office receives Rs1.2tr in Jul-Dec, despite adverse business climate","Despite difficult business conditions, the Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) Karachi received a record revenue of more than Rs1 trillion during the first half (Jul-Dec) of the current financial year.
In Jul-Dec FY24, the LTO collected Rs1,220 billion as compared to the target of Rs1,216 billion. In December 2023 alone, the tax department got revenue of Rs320 billion, which was higher than the target of Rs316 billion.
LTO Karachi Commissioner Girdhari Mal unveiled the figures while speaking at a press conference on Wednesday.
He pointed out that in the first half of FY24, the tax office recovered Rs24 billion from defaulters, adding, however, that revenue worth Rs38 billion was stuck in litigation.
He emphasised that the LTO was successfully achieving its monthly tax targets and in Jul-Dec FY24 revenue receipts including on imports surged 51%. With sales tax on imports and domestic sales, the revenue collection increased 57%.
Between July and December, sales tax and income tax refunds of Rs75 billion were issued, which represented a rise of 100%. Of the total collection, direct tax had a share of 55% while indirect tax contributed 45%.
In the six-month period under review, 69% of revenue came from local taxes while 31% came from the import sector.
Read IMF tax collection target surpassed
The LTO commissioner said that tax receipts were improving at the local level, adding in the half year, withholding tax comprised 28% of total collection while non-withholding tax had a share of 72%.
Similarly, the share of receipts through tax returns was Rs54 billion. He revealed that the contribution of cotton ginners, banking, shipping, insurance, pharmaceutical, tiles, food and software sectors in tax payments remained high.
However, receipts from the automobile, auto parts and construction industries decreased. A reason was the losses suffered by the auto industry owing to tough business conditions during the period under review.
The commissioner added that 1,064 tier-1 retailers were connected to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) through the Point of Sales (POS) network in Jul-Dec FY24 and 2,594 POS machines had so far been installed.
Revenue worth Rs4.4 billion was received through the POS system, from which collections rose 29%. “Out of the 105 complaints received from the Federal Tax Ombudsman, 85 were decided while 20 were being reviewed.”

5,Stocks gain ground in volatile trading,"KSE-100 index rises 297.25 points, settles at 64,646.85","Pakistan Stock Exchange faced a mix of upside and downside movement on Wednesday and resultantly the KSE-100 index swung between green and red zones, managing to end the day in the green.
The bourse commenced the day on a positive note but very soon came under pressure from profit-taking.
The market recovered from its initial downward trend and reached the intra-day high of 65,244.60 points as value hunters, especially in the exploration and production (E&P), fertiliser, tobacco and cement sectors, took control of the market.
However, due to the prevailing uncertainty, the index kept trading in a narrow range during final hours and was unable to surpass the 65,000-point mark for another day.
“Bullish activity was witnessed amid upbeat data on exports that surged 22.2% year-on-year (YoY) to $2.81 billion, trade deficit which shrank 40% YoY to $1.7 billion and cement dispatches that increased 4.6% YoY in December 2023,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Investor speculation ahead of major earnings’ announcements, which are due next week, rupee stability and potential release of IMF tranche this month played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 297.25 points, or 0.46%, and settled at 64,646.85.
Topline Securities, in its report, declared the day as “a tug of war”. Pakistan equities had a mixed day, which kicked off on a positive note and the KSE-100 index hit an intra-day high at 65,241 (+895 points, or 1.39%), it said.
At the aforesaid level, profit-taking was seen, which compelled the benchmark index to shed earlier gains and ultimately settled at 64,647 (+297 points, or 0.46%). During the day, the index touched the intra-day low at 64,220 (-130 points, or 0.20%).
E&P, fertiliser, tobacco and cement sectors contributed the most as Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Pakistan Tobacco and Kohat Cement added 267 points to the index.
On the flip side, Millat Tractors, Meezan Bank and Pakistan State Oil cumulatively lost 74 points due to profit-taking, Topline added.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, wrote “intra-day highs again failed at the weekly target of 65,000, leaving open the potential for a decline to 63,000”.
“The outlook remains positive and declines to the support level should be bought to target 67,000,” the AHL report said.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said another volatile session was witnessed at the PSX. The steel sector posted handsome gains with International Industries and Amreli Steels closing at their upper circuits.
“Market volatility may continue in the coming sessions on election-related news flow; investors are advised to stay cautious and accumulate value stocks on dips,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 639.6 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 671.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs20.3 billion.
Shares of 366 companies were traded. Of these, 190 stocks closed higher, 159 dropped and 17 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 127.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.17 to close at Rs5.47. It was followed by Pakistan Telecommunication Company with 50.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.74 to close at Rs13.49 and Pakistan Refinery with 35.8 million shares, losing Rs1.91 to close at Rs28.06.
Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs550.6 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,"10,000 e-Rozgar Centres to be set up for freelancers","Govt will kick off project on Jan 11, provide centres with latest facilities","Caretaker Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Dr Umar Saif on Wednesday disclosed that the government would initiate a project on January 11 to establish 10,000 e-Rozgar Centres across the country that would be equipped with the latest facilities for freelancers and start-ups.
“This historic initiative is aimed at addressing the challenges faced by approximately 1.5 million freelancers, who lack suitable workspaces,” he remarked while speaking in an interview with a news channel.
“Freelancers equipped with the required tools and environment to thrive in the digital landscape is the need of the hour.”
The minister elaborated that the establishment of joint e-Rozgar Centres would help increase investment in Pakistan and create new employment opportunities.
Umar urged the youth to become entrepreneurs as they could easily earn more per month through e-Rozgar. Replying to a question, the minister said that from January 7 another project would be initiated to introduce a standardised test for IT graduates through the Higher Education Commission to gauge their skills and offer them internships.

“Those who clear the test will be given a mandatory internship in the IT industry. Pakistani universities produce around 75,000 IT graduates every year, out of which, only 3,000 are eligible for employment in IT companies.”
He voiced hope that IT exports would soar to $4 billion after the State Bank of Pakistan allowed IT companies to retain 50% of their receipts in dollar accounts. “We want to empower the youth with info-tech skills and are making all-out efforts for the purpose,” he added.
“The IT and telecom ministry is working on all those projects that will create employment opportunities for youngsters.” It is also trying to take Pakistan forward in the field of education through the provision of IT skills and empowering the skilled manpower.

7,Traders ride Chinese county’s boom,Initiatives like CPEC make it very easy for local traders to do business,"More Pakistani traders are settling in the Tashikurgan Tajik autonomous county of Kashgar in China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region to tap the business potential.
As the county is close to their homes, they said it was easy to commute and interact with the local community. A booming tourism is benefitting their businesses.
Pakistani jeweller Murad Shah said his gemstone store in the county “welcomes about 100 to 200 tourists a day after it resumed operations in April”.
He stressed that his business had started to recover after China successfully implemented its Covid-19 policies. “There are a lot of tourists. The county has a diverse culture and landscape, and so many good attractions to see,” he said, adding that he was hopeful about the future, China Daily reported.
Read Vital trade road to be constructed under CPEC
One good reason for him to open a store in the county is that his hometown, a small village in Pakistan, is just 200 kilometres and three hours away by car.
Another reason is that China is developing very fast with a sound economy. “Many Pakistanis prefer to do business here because there is money,” Shah said.
Located on the Pamir Plateau, the county, with an area of 25,000 square kilometres and a population of 41,000, is the only one in China that borders three countries – Pakistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
It has two land ports – the Khunjerab Pass is 125 km from Sust Port in Pakistan and the Karasu Port is only 14 km from Kulma Pass in Tajikistan. The number of tourist visits reached over 1.34 million from January to late December, up 86% YoY, with May to October being peak season.

8,Ministries violate cabinet directive,Release Rs131b to state-owned power companies without recovering dues,"The interim government has violated a decision of the federal cabinet, failing to recover approximately Rs95 billion from publicly-owned power sector companies. Instead, it released Rs131 billion without first deducting its receivables.
This failure by two ministries to implement the cabinet’s decision has resulted in a higher level of budget deficit for the first half of the fiscal year. Recovering loans and cash dividends could have helped maintain a marginally lower overall budget deficit.
Sources revealed to The Express Tribune that neither the Ministry of Finance nor the Ministry of Energy recovered cash loans and dividends while settling the Rs131 billion circular debt of government-owned power sector firms. It was estimated that the government might recover Rs78 billion in the form of old loans and another approximately Rs15 billion in dividend receipts.
Three weeks ago, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet instructed the government to prioritise the recovery of government loans while settling the circular debt of four power sector firms. The ECC decision was subsequently vetted by the federal cabinet. Both ministries are in violation of the cabinet decision.
On December 19, the ECC approved a total payment of Rs264 billion to four government-owned power generation firms. It decided to make the payment in two tranches, and the first tranche of Rs131 billion was released last week, according to sources. However, the payment was made without first recovering the dues.
The ECC had directed that “in the utilisation of the funds received through this arrangement, the government-owned power plants shall accord priority to the clearance of their foreign relent loans and cash development loans.”
The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) owed Rs186 billion to the federal government. The idea was to recover at least Rs68 billion from Wapda while releasing the first tranche, according to sources. Similarly, three government-owned power generation companies owed Rs30 billion to the government, but no deduction was made from them.
“The ECC’s decision would be implemented that directed the government-owned power plants to give priority to the settlement of their dues,” said Qamar Abbasi, the spokesperson for the finance ministry.
The Central Power Purchase Agency Guaranteed (CPPAG) has taken undertakings from the three power generation companies to ensure they will make payments. The undertakings were shared with the Ministry of Finance, said Rihan Akhtar, CPPAG CEO.
The sources mentioned that the finance ministry was initially in favour of recovering these dues but subsequently changed its position at the time of making these payments.
There were views that, since these power sector firms face liquidity problems, it would be good to forgo the government’s revenues at this stage. However, this view is against the decision of the ECC, which, in its collective wisdom, decided to recover the loans.

On the instructions of the International Monetary Fund, the Ministry of Finance has released the first comprehensive report on the performance of the country’s public sector companies. The report reveals how badly the power sector is managed despite almost every company’s board having a representative of the finance ministry and the energy ministry.
The report showed that there were about 22 companies, including power distribution companies, generation companies, transmission companies, and power management companies. The power sector suffered a net loss of Rs320 billion. Wapda earned Rs19.4 billion profit in the fiscal year 2022, according to the finance ministry’s report on the SOEs. Till 2022, Wapda owed Rs56 billion to the federal government in terms of loans, and Rs111 billion guarantees were also issued to facilitate it in borrowing the funds.
Money was also paid to two power generation firms, Muzaffargarh power plant and Guddu power plant. The SOE report showed that the Jamshoro plant incurred a loss of Rs4 billion in 2022 and its equity was negative by Rs17 billion. The return on assets was also negative by 3.4%. Two officers of the finance ministry and the energy minister were the members of the Jamshoro power plant.
The Guddu power plant also incurred Rs6.1 billion losses in 2022, and its return on assets was negative by 3%, and equity too turned negative by Rs7 billion. The Muzaffargarh power plant caused Rs3.7 billion losses, and its return on equity was negative by 4.9%, and return on assets was negative by 1.6%.
Successive governments have failed to privatise power sector firms. The presence of bureaucrats on the boards of these companies is now a part of the problem, as they are not effectively watching the interest of the single shareholder—the government.
Pakistan has committed to the IMF to reduce the circular debt of the power and gas sectors. However, the reduction so far has been done either mainly by increasing the prices of electricity and gas or by providing money from the budget.
A higher level of the gas sector circular debt because of non-settlement of their dues by the power sector companies might also result in a further increase in gas prices to meet commitments with the IMF.
During the first four months of this fiscal year, another Rs300 billion was added to the power sector circular debt, taking it to Rs2.6 trillion. Overall, during the first half, the federal government has paid Rs340 billion to the power sector from the budget.
