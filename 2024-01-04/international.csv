3,Rural women urged to give birth at hospitals,Mother and Child Welfare Programme comes to Sanghar district in third phase,"Even in the 21st century, many women in rural Sindh give birth at home rather than in the safe environment of hospitals, said Sanghar district Deputy Commissioner Dr Imranul Hasan Khwaja.
He said that the Sindh government has launched a programme for better health of pregnant women and new-born babies with the aim of encouraging expectant mothers to give birth in hospitals instead of at home. 
He expressed this while during a meeting of the district coordination committee. 
Dr. Khwaja stated, Peoples' Primary Health Initiative Sindh (PPHI Sindh) under the Sindh social security authority has launched the ""Mother and Child Welfare Programme"" through its 750 hospitals in 15 districts of the province in which Sanghar district has also been included in the third phase.

The Program Manager of Social Security Hafiz Zafaruddin Qazi, while briefing the meeting through video link, informed that the total cost of this programme is around Rs50 billion for which the main financial support has been provided by the World Bank and the objective of this programme is to improve maternal and child health including implementation of social security system in the province so that the less privileged areas can be provided social security by the state. 
Under the programme, 1.3 million women, giving birth in hospitals in 15 districts of Sindh, will be paid Rs30,000 each in instalments, including basic health facilities, medicines, laboratory tests and check-up facilities upon arrival at the hospital, he said and added that 40 to 50 per cent of women in Sindh give birth at home instead of hospitals, which puts the health of mother and child at risk.
Additional Deputy Commissioner Saleem Jatoi, all assistant commissioners, district health officer, additional director of local government and other members were also present in the meeting.

4,Old city area plagued with water woes,"Multiple localities from area have rotten, dilapidated supply lines which have existed since British era","The port city is plagued with a clean water problem but some areas of the metropolis have it worse than others. For instance, the Old City area, where the water distribution has collapsed due to deterioration and decades of neglect. 
Areas which comprise the Old City in Karachi are at the farthest end in terms of water delivery, as per urban planners and locals, and thus those who reside in those areas have to fulfil their water needs by relying on water porters, colloquially referred to as mashikis, who travel door to door with a leather bag full of water. However, that is not a sustainable solution. 
In this regard, Nausheen Khatoom, a long-term resident of Pakistan Chowk, which is part of the Old City area, highlighted the plight of living in the locality. “The water pipes are visibly rotten, so it is not surprising that they are not fit to distribute water efficiently,” remarked Nausheen, further adding that it was a shame that for decades people of the Old City area had been demanding access to water but those demands seem to fall on deaf ears. 
Whether it is Pakistan Chowk, or other localities in the Old City area, like Bohrapir, Ranchod Line, Burns Road, Kharadar, Meetha Dar, and Bolton Market, dilapidated water lines and the consequent inefficient water supply plagues affects all. 
Muhammad Ayub, a 65-year-old resident of Burns Road, while talking to the Express Tribune, expressed his frustration at the fact that people on this side of Karachi had to rely on the centuries old practice of mashiki to get access to such a crucial natural resource. “Whatever water flows through these dilapidated lines is probably hazardous. Therefore, all credit goes to the government that we are forced to pay on a daily basis for the water we drink and use,” the elderly citizen criticised. 
Like Nausheen, Muhammad too was of the view that politicians only used the populace for votes and when it came to delivering on their promises “the politicians are nowhere to be seen.”

Faheem-ul-Zaman, a former administrator of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), is familiar with the plight of the residents of the Old City area. According to Faheem, the water lines in the area were installed in the British era and no one has thought of placing new ones ever since. “Even though two main water lines were installed here to solve the water issue, a 66-inch line in 1984 and a 24-inch one prior to that; they are not enough,” the former KMC administrator asserted, further adding that the crisis has been further exacerbated due to people installing illegal connections in the already semi-functional water lines. 
Given that the last water line installed in the area was nearly 4 decades ago, urban planners feel that only new water lines are the solution. Sadia Jabeen, an urban planner and a senior civil engineer at the University of Karachi, suggested that to solve the water scarcity in the Old Area the water board should install new water lines as part of Karachi’s master plan. 
Farhan Anwar, another urban planner based in the city, agrees. However, Farhan further suggested: “Apart from new water lines, there is an immediate need to devolve power to the local governments so they can be on top of issues such as water scarcity and address them in a timely fashion.” 
Farhan’s suggestion is music to the ears of Muhammad Dilawar, former town nazim from the old city area. “We need to realise that water being delivered on push-carts and on the back of labourers in leather bags is a practice of prehistoric times. A city of Karachi’s stature and its residents should not be subjected to such a plight just because the government and the water board are inefficient,” he demanded while talking to The Express Tribune.

5,‘Citizens should form neighbourhood watch committees’,"JI Karachi chief criticises govt, police for leaving people at mercy of armed robbers","Residents of Orangi and the rest of the city should set up neighbourhood committees, protect themselves and their children said Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi head Hafiz Naeemur Rehman.
He was talking to the media after the funeral prayers ofJI activist Waseem Siddiqui, who was killed by unidentified suspects near his home in Orangi Town
Maulana Abu Saeed, the founder of Jamia Bab Uloom Islamia and Imam of Jamia Masjid Noorani, led the funeral prayer held at Gulfamabad near Aligarh Colony, while the burial took place in the local cemetery.

 JI office bearers, family and friends of the deceased attended the funeral in large numbers. Speaking on the occasion of the funeral prayer, Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman said that the responsibility of the killing of Waseem Siddiqui lies with the government and the state. 
He said that the family members of the deceased are questioning the government and the state that why they are not being provided security, they are also citizens of the country. A system of oppression prevails in the country including Karachi and murderers rule the street killing people with impunity. 
The murder of the JI worker is a question mark for the government, Rangers and police department is how killers can openly kill a citizen. JI stands with Waseem's family and relatives. JI demands that the killers of Waseem must be arrested immediately, he said.

6,Metropolis to continue to suffer stepchild treatment,"Lack of development in transport, water and waste management sectors risks aggravating social chaos in the city","As the nation welcomes 2024 with reignited spirits, locals in Karachi still cry over the same unnerving issues, as a lack of attention given by the government to the completion and upgradation of fundamental development projects has turned the banal idea of driving on smooth and clean roads, travelling through public transport and drinking safe water, into a fanciful hallucination.
With 2023 behind us, looking retrospectively at the developments made during the past one year, regrettably brings to light the unsatisfactory progress observed in the course of several infrastructural, transport, water and waste disposal projects, which till date remain in limbo, depriving the disgruntled populace of the largest revenue generating province, their right to a decent standard of living.
""The anger of people in Karachi has become unswerving. The water crisis, lack of public transport, piling of garbage, pollution, broken roads and street crime alongside soaring inflation and peaking unemployment, have all intensified citizens' mistrust of the state and its associated institutions. While many people are leaving the country, those who cannot afford to immigrate might not be able to contain their resentment for too long and a disruptive uprising similar to the 1980's and 1990's might become inevitable,"" predicted Dr Tauseef Ahmed Khan, renowned columnist and Professor at the Mass Communication Department of the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology (FUUAST), who implored the government toimmediately take concrete steps towards completing the pending initiatives in 2024.
Despite the fact that a large city like Karachi with a population of 30 million people, needs at least 8000 big buses, outright neglect of the public transport system has led to a reduction in the number of buses from 6000 to 2500 alongside the closure of almost 400 public transport routes during the past one and half decades.
Moreover, newly announced projects like the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit Project, Orange Line Bus Project and Red Line Bus Project are still either in need of upgradation or completion.
Similarly, due to a non-disbursement of funds, the Sindh government has not been able to complete even a single water project as the K-IV project and 65 MGD plan alongside its distribution line continue to remain pending.

Additionally, much of Karachi's connective infrastructure including the MA Jinnah Road, New MA Jinnah Road, SM Taufiq Road, Shahrah-e-Pakistan, Rashid Minhas Road, University Road, Altaf Barelvi Road, Nishtar Road, Jail Road, Jamshed Road, Hakim Ibn-e-Sina, Sher Shah Suri Road, Garden Road, MT Khan Road, Hub River Road, Korangi Industrial Area Road, Karsaz Road, and Pir Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi Road among dozens of other internal roads and streets have been in a dilapidated state for years.
To make matters worse, the shabby roads are overflowing with filth since almost 18,000 tons of waste is generated in the city, out of which only 8,000 to 10,000 tons of waste is collected and disposed of at the landfill site by 18 government institutions in the city, alongside one entrusted Chinese and one Turkish waste disposal company.
According to Hafiz Naeemur-Rehman, leader of the opposition in the Council of the Supreme Municipality Karachi and Ameer of Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi, the federal and provincial governments have always treated Karachi as a stepchild. ""All of the major parties have remained in power, but Karachi's problems could not be solved. Banners for new projects are put up for the sake of political mobilization but no progress is made for their completion. As a result, Karachi's locals are suffering from mental exasperation,"" he added.
""It is a pity that no master plan has been prepared for Karachi's development till date and neither the elected representatives nor the local bodies have been empowered to act independently. Until or unless the legislative institutions take concrete steps in this regard, the city's problems will not be solved till doomsday,"" opined Dr Syed Nawaz Al Huda, a regional planner.
In an attempt to inquire further on the matter, The Express Tribune tried contacting Murtaza Wahab, the Mayor of Karachi, but no response was given.
