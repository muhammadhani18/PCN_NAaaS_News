0,"No ban on Imran’s speeches, PEMRA tells LHC",Court dismisses PTI plea challenging ECP decision to revoke electoral bat symbol,"The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) on Thursday informed the Lahore High Court (LHC) that there was no ban on the broadcast of former prime minister Imran Khan’s speeches.
Pemra's counsel Haroon Duggal said this during the hearing of a petition filed by the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) last year against Pemra’s decision to bar all TV channels from airing Imran's speeches and news conferences. The hearing was presided over by Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza.
After the hearing, Justice Mirza directed the media regulatory body not to pressure TV channels into barring the broadcast of Imran’s speeches. On March 5, 2023, the regulatory body imposed a blanket ban on broadcasting live or recorded speeches of the former premier on all satellite TV channels.

“It has been observed that Mr Imran Khan, Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, in his speeches/statements is continuously ... levelling baseless allegations and spreading hate speech through his provocative statements against state institutions and officers which is prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order and is likely to disturb public peace and tranquillity,” the order issued by the media regulatory authority read.
The next day, the former PTI chairman filed a petition in the LHC challenging Pemra’s prohibition order. The petition, filed through barrister Muhammed Ahmed Pansota, had contended that in the judgment reported as “Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi Vs Pemra”, then Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Athar Minallah had declared a similar Pemra prohibition order as “ultra vires the Ordinance” (over-stretching itself beyond the powers conferred upon it) on similar grounds.

Imran’s counsel had stated in the petition that Pemra had issued the impugned order beyond their jurisdiction and without having regard to the constitutional rights guaranteed under articles 19 and 19-A of the Constitution. On March 9, 2023, Justice Mirza, presiding over the hearing, suspended the ban imposed by the media regulatory authority.
It should be noted that Pemra had also imposed a prohibition order against airing Imran’s live or recorded speeches on Aug 21, 2022, after the PTI chief had warned Islamabad inspector general of police (IGP) and deputy inspector general of police (DIG) in which he had said that he would not spare them and would register a case against them for “torturing” party leader Shahbaz Gill during his physical remand.
He had also called out Additional District and Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry for approving the police request of physical remand despite knowing that Gill was subjected to “torture”. “We will not leave you [Zeba] and will also file a case.” Separately, the LHC dismissed the PTI plea challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to revoke the party’s popular electoral symbol, the ‘cricket bat’.

Announcing the decision reserved a day earlier, Justice Jawad Hasan declared the petition non-maintainable. Justice Jawad observed that the Peshawar High Court (PHC), through its order, passed in a writ petition, dated Dec 26, 2023, has already taken up the same matter and suspended the ECP’s decision. The order maintained that the matter was still pending adjudication there.
“In these circumstances, agitating the same matter before two parallel forums may result in conflicting opinions thereby undermining the judicial process, besides resulting in multiplicity of litigation that may result in delaying the elections,” the LHC’s order stated.

2,NIH issues advisory on new Covid variant,WHO last month classified JN.1 coronavirus strain as VOI; current evidence shows risk to public health,"The National Institute of Health (NIH) on Wednesday issued an advisory for the prevention and control of JN.1 sub-variant of the Covid-19 virus.
According to NIH, the objective of the advisory was to alert and facilitate the health authorities and other stakeholders to ensure timely prevention and control measures encompassing preparedness to deal with such patients in future.
The advisory said that JN.1 is classified as a Variant of Interest (VOI) and fundamentally an offshoot of BA.2.86 sub-variant of the omicron variant.
Initially reported in mid-2023 by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), JN.1 has witnessed a surge in reported cases across various countries in recent weeks, indicating its rapid global spread.
This rapid growth is observed across the three World Health Organisation (WHO) regions with consistent sharing of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These regions include the Americas, the Western Pacific and the European regions, with the largest increase seen in Western Pacific from 1.1% in epidemiological week 44 to 65.6% in epidemiological week 48.

The WHO last month classified the JN.1 coronavirus strain as a VOI and said current evidence shows risk to public health was low from the strain.
Experts said that while the strain can evade the immune system and transmit more easily than other currently circulating variants, it has not shown any signs of more severe disease.
While there might be more cases with the variant, JN.1 doesn't pose a greater risk, said Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. JN.1 was previously classified as a VOI as part of its parent lineage BA.2.86, but WHO has now classified it as a separate variant of interest. WHO said current vaccines will continue to protect against severe disease and death from JN.1 and other circulating variants of the Covid-19 virus.

4,Naqvi responds to SJC's show cause notice,Reiterates claim that charges against him are baseless,"Supreme Court Judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi has submitted a detailed reply to the second show cause notice from the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), reiterating his assertion that the misconduct allegations leveled against him are baseless.
Sources indicate that the SC judge has also argued that the SJC proceedings are now unjustified since the SC has already addressed his plea against these proceedings. The council is scheduled to resume hearing the complaints filed against the judge on January 11.
Last year, on October 27, the SJC issued its first show cause notice to Justice Naqvi following numerous complaints accusing the judge of manipulating benches and engaging in financial corruption.

5,PTI moves SC against PHC Jan 3 order,Requests top court to take up the matter expeditiously," 
The PTI has approached the Supreme Court against an order of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) which stripped the former ruling party of its iconic election symbol of a cricket bat. The party has requested the top court to take up the matter expeditiously in view of the upcoming general elections.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on December 22 invalidated the PTI’s intra-party elections held on December 2 on the instruction of the polls oversight authority. The ECP order also resulted in depriving the party of its election symbol. The PTI moved the PHC against the order whose single-member bench on December 26 suspended the ECP order.

The commission later filed an instant application against the PHC order and once again a single-judge bench of the court on Tuesday, January 3, set aside the court’s earlier order. In a six-page order authored by Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan, the court noted that the PHC’s earlier order was an ad-interim, ex-parte order passed without providing any opportunity of hearing to the ECP.
It stated that the interim order of December 26 “prima facie amounted to granting final relief for all legal, factual and practical purposes”. “While passing the said order, an aspect of its effectiveness beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this court [which is limited to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] was not taken into consideration,” it said.


In its petition, the PTI contended that the PHC single-member bench on January 3 misapplied the law, resulting in miscarriage of justice. It said the provincial high court had earlier granted interim relief to the party after hearing the ECP’s additional director general (ADG) law “who had argued at length” and so it was not correct that the December 26 order was passed without hearing the ECP.
The petition argued that ex-parte injunctions are also granted where irreparable or serious mischief will ensue to a petitioner, especially when refusal of the ex-parte injunction would involve greater injustice. The party stated that the interim relief granted to the PTI was not a final order and was valid until January 9 when a division bench of the PHC will take up the party’s main petition.

The PTI declared that the January 3 order is misconceived as there is no question of territorial effectiveness of the court. “With that impugned order [of December 26], it was a matter between the ECP and the PTI and once that order is set aside it is a settled law that order of a high court [will] be implemented.”
It said the jurisdiction of the high court extends to examining the validity of the orders of the ECP as the ECP operates within the jurisdiction of the PHC and order is effective for the entire K-P province. “If the territorial effectiveness of an order of a high court is to be seen as observed by a learned single judge then in every case…all the five high courts [will have] to pass the same order for it to be implemented all over Pakistan,” the petition said.
