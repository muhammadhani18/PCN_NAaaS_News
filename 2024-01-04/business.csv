Despite their initiation in June 2022, located in Salarzai Tehsil, Larkhalozo, Mamond, and Nawagai areas of Bajaur, these hospitals have faced an ongoing issue of staff members not receiving their rightful salaries.
The closures come as a response to repeated protests and appeals by the dedicated staff, including highly trained doctors, who have now opted to shut down the facilities in a collective protest against the prolonged salary delays.

This has left the hospitals, equipped with skilled medical professionals, inoperable, raising concerns about the impact on patient care and the broader community’s health needs.
An official of these hospitals while talking to The Express Tribune said the hospital building, including OPD, has been locked permanently.
“The private company has been paying us for three months after each 12 months which is not acceptable,” he said, adding that government has released funds for the project but the hospital administration is not willing to pay us our dues. He said that the protest will continue till the fulfilment of all the demands.

1,Candidates win tribunal’s nod,Balochistan tribunal overturns over a dozen rejected nominations,"The Balochistan Election Tribunal granted permission to more than a dozen candidates, whose nomination papers were initially rejected by returning officers, to participate in the upcoming general elections. 
With over 100 appeals filed, the Election Tribunal in Balochistan, led by senior judges of the Balochistan High Court, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, and Justice Amir Nawaz Rana, reviewed and decided on these cases.
Similar to other regions in the country, returning officers across Balochistan had dismissed the nomination papers of numerous candidates on various grounds, notably for outstanding utility bill payments.

In response, the tribunal accepted seven appeals challenging the rejection of nomination papers, rectifying objections, and granting the applicants the opportunity to partake in the elections. Among those permitted were Abdul Khaliq Hazara (Chairman of Hazara Democratic Party), Tahir Mehmood Khan (PPP), Ahmed Nawaz Baloch (BNP), Mehmood Khan Sherani, Mufti Gulab (JUI-F), Zakir Hussain Kasi, and Muhammad Hussain.
The rejected nomination papers also included prominent figures such as Sardar Akhtar Mengal (BNP chief), Khushal Khan Kakar (Chief of Pakhtunkhwa National Party), and Nawab Ayaz Khan Jogezai (Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party). While Sardar Akhtar Mengal had announced plans to legally challenge the rejection, as of now, he has not officially contested the decision before the election tribunal in Balochistan.
The Balochistan High Court premises witnessed a significant presence of supporters from various political parties eagerly awaiting the tribunal’s decisions on the nomination papers. The Quetta administration had implemented stringent security measures to prevent any untoward incidents during the hearing of these cases, underscoring the importance of a secure and orderly legal process in the electoral proceedings.

2,Cop martyred in North Waziristan,JUI-F candidate for PK-19 escapes unhurt in Bajaur roadside bomb explosion,"Yet another policeman was gunned down in the troubled North Waziristan tribal district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) on Wednesday. 
In a separate incident, a candidate of Jamiat Uelema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) came under a roadside bomb attack in Bajaur, causing widespread panic among the local residents.
Police told The Express Tribune that unidentified miscreants opened fire on Constable Jan Alam outside a bank in Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan. 
He said that the unfortunate constable was there to withdraw his salary and was targeted on his way back home. His body was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital Mir Ali where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
“He was the resident of Harmaz village and the attackers once again managed to escape unchallenged after committing the crime,” said the official of the local police station, adding a large contingent of police reached there and launched a door-to-door search operation but there was no trace of the attackers.
Police registered an FIR and opened investigation in the case.
Police said that it was without any doubt a case of terrorism as the cop had no personal feud with anyone.
It may be recalled that just a day ago, six non-local young barbers were slaughtered in an incident of sinister violence that seeks to capitalise on ethnic faultlines in North Waziristan where four terrorists, including a would-be suicide bomber, were also eliminated in an intelligence based operation (IBO) on Tuesday.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the sickening slaughter in the Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan, but the banned umbrella of terrorist outfits, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, maintains a presence in the region.
The bodies of the six men were discovered in the fields of Moski village, located in Mir Ali. Preliminary investigation suggests that the victims, all of whom hailed from Punjab, were shot dead execution style.
The victims, all below 30 years of age, included two youths less than 18 years’ old, hence without national identity cards (NICs). All of them were barbers, having recently migrated to North Waziristan to pursue their trade. Sources reveal that the victims owned barber shops in Mir Ali Bazaar.
According to sources, the barbers were reported to have been kidnapped before meeting their tragic end. They were abducted under the cloak of darkness and subsequently murdered by unidentified assailants. It was not until morning that the bodies were spotted by locals in the fields, who immediately alerted the law enforcers. The bodies were shifted to Mir Ali Hospital for medico-legal formalities.
Meanwhile, four terrorists were killed in an intelligence based operation (IBO) in North Waziristan. As per a statement of the military’s media wing, intense fire exchange took place between troops and the terrorists during the conduct of operation.
On the other hand, JUI-F candidate for PK-19 Mamond, Qari Kherullah escaped unhurt in a roadside bomb blast in Lowy Mamond area of Bajaur.
