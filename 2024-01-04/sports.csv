0,Police helpline flooded by hoax calls,"Caller tracing, response monitoring to be boosted","The Punjab Police has decided to upgrade its emergency helpline 15 system to deal with a flood of hoax calls and allegations of poor or delayed response.
The planned initiatives include identification and location of the callers, as well as monitoring of the responding teams.
The helpline had received over 30 million calls across the province during the past year but as many as 20 million of them proved to be fake. The ratio of spurious emergency call received through the helpline during the year was as high as 66 per cent.
According to an official, a number of the phone calls wasting time of the responding staff had been made by children. 
When the department traced phone numbers used by children to calls the helpline 15 a few months back, it was revealed that parents often handed over their mobile phones to their children to avoid disturbance from them.

The children consciously or involuntarily had called the helpline because its number was on the speed dial option.
The police had also shortlisted the repeated fake callers a year earlier. Warning phone calls had bene made to the numbers against the act. 
Some first information reports (FIRs) had also been registered against the repeat offenders.
However, the issue remains unresolved and the number of hoax callers has not dropped.
On the other hand, complaints of delayed response by police teams or an inconsiderate response also remained rampant during the year.
For improvement on both fronts, the police top brass has decided to introduce some radical interventions.
A senior officer shared that the interventions being discussed included access to the location of the callers and their identification details.
The details of the subscriber identity module (SIM) card being used by a caller to 15 and its location will also be accessed from the helpline control room.

Details regarding the responding police teams, their members’ identities and vehicles’ location will also be accessible by the control room.
The citizens would also be enabled to register their feedback about the response and behaviour of the police officials responding to the calls for emergency help, the sources added.
The control room will monitor the response time through the live location details of the police teams from receiving the calls to arriving at the locations of the callers.
Pending investigations
Meanwhile, Capital City Police Officer Bilal Siddique Kamyana instructed investigation officials to expedite the resolution of pending road certificate, electricity theft and ongoing cases.
Presiding over a meeting of senior officers of the investigation wing, he emphasised the importance of timely completion of work by the prosecutors and called for updating the police officers' data in this regard in a software.
The official underscored the pivotal role of the police investigation wing in achieving justice. 
He directed the SPs to hold regular meetings with the DSPs and investigation in-charges to ensure investigations based on merit, justice and legal requirements. Kamyana stressed that delivering justice to the victims relied on thorough and quality investigations.

3,Toxic fodder causes livestock losses,Cases of food poisoning among animals increase to alarming level,"Unregistered chemical factories manufacturing cattle feed are the main obstacle in the way of the Punjab government's plan to impose a livestock emergency to increase production of meat and milk in the province. In the districts with sugar mills, the use of chemical effluents from those mills as cattle fodder has increased. This practice is a clear violation of the Punjab Animal Feed Stuff and Compound Feed Act 2016.
A few years ago, waste used to be given to the farmers free of cost to increase the fertility of the land.
According to details, more than half-a-dozen of chemicals are used during the process of extracting sugar from cane. Different chemicals are used to kill bacteria and germs. The cases of toxic food poisoning in animals from eating waste that contained chemical residues have increased to an alarming level. Eventually, people are taken ill after consuming the meat and milk of such animals.

Punjab government has decided to impose a livestock emergency in the province to increase production of milk and meat and their export. However, the goal cannot be achieved without maintaining the standard of feed for the cattle. 
Cattle farmers have demanded of the caretaker chief minister of Punjab and provincial ministers concerned to place a ban on the use of waste containing toxic chemicals as cattle fodder to protect lives of humans and animals.
Cattle farmers Zia-ul-Haq and Liaqat Ali alleged that factories producing silage across the province were using chemicals in flagrant violation of the Punjab Animal Feed Stuff and Compound Feed Act 2016. 
By this method, milk and meat production increased temporarily. However, consumption of milk and meat of these animals had profound effects on the health of people, especially those of children.

Leaders of the Livestock, Dairy and Breeding Association, Rana Ameer Mohammad and Sardar Yaqoob, had demanded of the government to mobilise the laboratories of the Livestock Department to prevent the use of waste containing chemicals.
In November last year, the Punjab livestock department had arranged a training workshop in Multan to sensitise livestock breeders on fog fever. 
The workshop, led by Livestock Deputy Director Dr. Jamshed Akhtar, aimed to equip cattle breeders with vital knowledge on preventive measures, emphasising the critical importance of protecting their animals from the potentially fatal illness, which was prevalent during the winter months.

5,Anti-graft actions marred with partiality,A significant chunk of cases initiated by the dept in the preceding year were against politicians,"Last year, Punjab was marred with the musical chair of arrests of political individuals in graft cases, and while it remains to be seen whether the practice will continue this year, it has put question marks on the impartiality of the provincial anti-corruption department. 
Dozen of politicians, bureaucrats, and civilians, especially those associated with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, like the wife of the former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, her close aide, Farah Khan Gogi, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, Moonis Elahi, Muhammad Khan Bhatti, and Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, had graft cases brought against them by the department in 2023, which some political commentators termed as “political victimisation.” 
It is pertinent to mention that the Anti-Corruption Establishment saw three different Director Generals (DGs) during the previous year and under the leadership of all three, the department initiated a significant amount of seemingly political score settling cases.

Commenting on the department’s performance in 2023, Brigadier (r) Muhammad Aslam Ghumman, who served as its DG during Parvez Muhsarraf’s regime, said, “the department has now become a tool for political victimisation. Whoever comes into government uses the Anti-Corruption Establishment to go after their political rivals.” 
“Presently, the department is opening up graft cases on the basis of transactions dating back to 1986. This alone should be enough to judge the department’s performance in the preceding year,” he added. 
Agreeing with Ghumman, former inspector general of Punjab police, Major (r) Zia-ul-Hassan Khan, said that the main purpose of the Anti-Corruption Establishment is to have a check and balance on the bureaucracy, “but unfortunately the department is now solely used for political vendettas.” Khan further said that the cases being initiated these days by the Anti-Corruption Establishment were on mere surmises. “And this trend will continue in 2024 as well,” he predicted.

Abdullah Malik, a Lahore based social activist, concurring with Khan’s prediction, regretted that taxpayer money was being used for political witch hunts instead of actually punishing corruption. “Fake cases not only burden the taxpayers but they also make life hell for those caught up in them. Moreover, such frivolous cases also add to the workload of the judiciary. It is unfortunate that those in charge do not consider these aspects,” he asserted. 
In light of Malik’s assertions, The Express Tribune asked the Spokesperson of the Anti-Corruption Establishment Punjab, regarding the department’s partiality and its alleged involvement in political victimisation. “We have clear instructions to not spare anyone who engages in corruption. This is not about political bias or affiliation, if anyone is engaging in corruption then they should face the law,” quipped the Spokesperson. 
“If our performance was bad we would not have made any recoveries. However, during the past five years, the department has recovered government land worth more than Rs 204 billion. Moreover, in the same time period, about 6,576 officers and government employees have been arrested on charges of corruption,” the Spokesperson informed while talking to The Express Tribune.
