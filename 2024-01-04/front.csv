0,IHC restores 10-year disqualification period for NAB convicts,Division bench suspends single-bench ruling of five years,"The Islamabad High Court on Thursday restored the 10-year disqualification period for convicts charged under the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), suspending its earlier ruling of five years.
A division bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz took the decision on a plea filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on the disqualification of former Balochistan minister Faiq Ali Jamali. Jamali has been given a ticket by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz for the Balochistan Assembly seat – PB 16.
NAB had on July 25 challenged the IHC single-bench order wherein the disqualification period was limited to five years whereas the NAO provided a 10-year period for a convict.
An accountability court had sentenced Jamali to a 14-year imprisonment along with a fine of Rs6 million on corruption charges. Jamali was released from prison after completing his jail term in Oct 2013.
In July 2019, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by the then-chief justice of Pakistan Asif Saeed Khosa and comprising Justice Gulzar Ahmed and Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed, barred Jamali from contesting elections till 2026.
The then-CJP had ruled that the former minister would be allowed to participate in the elections after Nov 2026.
After changes were made to the Elections Act 2017 last year, reducing the period of disqualification to five years, Jamali filed a petition before the IHC seeking permission to contest the upcoming general elections.
The Balochistan High Court election appellate tribunal had fixed Wednesday to hear Jamali’s appeal against the rejection of his nomination papers.
In its appeal, NAB pleaded that Jamali’s disqualification under NAO could not be altered as the recently changed election law did not apply to his case.
On Thursday, the IHC issued a stay order on its earlier verdict, restoring Section 15 (disqualification to contest election or to hold public office) of NAO, which specifies a 10-year disqualification for convicts from “seeking or from being elected, chosen, appointed or nominated” as public office holders.
Last year, Jamali had quit the Balochistan Awami Party and joined the Pakistan Peoples Party. Two months ago, he joined the PML-N.
During the hearing, NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood argued that the disqualification period started from the time the convict was released from prison.
The prosecutor said that the PML-N ticket-holder was awarded a 10-year disqualification, adding that the Supreme Court had upheld his sentence.
Justice Kayani replied that arguments of the NAB official did not address the question raised as the sentence was not controversial.
Justice Kayani inquired whether the subsidiary legislation in the Constitution could be different from the interpretation given in it.
Prosecutor Maqsood replied that the metter had been discussed in the Constitution’s Article 63 (disqualification of parliament members) in a “general” sense. “The NAB ordinance is a special law. The sentence of 10-year disqualification is present in it,” the prosecutor argued.
He said that the candidates of national and provincial assemblies were relying on the decision of the IHC single bench, so the court should decide on NAB’s request soon.
The court, while suspending the decision of the single bench, asked the attorney general for assistance on the next hearing on Jan 15.

1,Freebies galore in PPP’s electoral agenda,"Bilawal unfolds ambitious plans for poor, says party does not make false promise","The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) unveiled an ambitious electoral agenda on Thursday, pledging to provide up to 300 units of free electricity, allocate free housing, ensure complimentary healthcare, furnish free education, and commit to doubling the incomes of the economically disadvantaged segments of society.
Expounding upon the party’s 10-point manifesto at a press conference and addressing a workers convention at Jatti Umra, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari underscored the party’s unwavering dedication to augmenting the incomes and the purchasing power of the people.
The announcements came after a meeting of the PPP Central Executive Committee (CEC), which officially nominated Bilawal as the candidate for the prime minister of Pakistan if the party won the general elections scheduled for February 8.
According to the manifesto, a PPP government would provide up to 300 units of free electricity to the people unable to pay high electricity bill, provide free high-quality education to the youth and reiterating its commitment to provision of free quality medical care to all citizens.
Referring to the party manifesto at the workers convention, Bilawal insisted that the PPP did not make false promises, unlike its political rivals – the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). “The PPP will fulfil its promise, if it hopefully gets the chance,” he said.
At the press conference, Bilawal highlighted the establishment of hospitals in every district of Sindh, where people receive medical treatment, even for intricate procedures such as heart-related interventions. He expressed his intent to expand these facilities nationwide.
In a taunting reference to the PML-N leadership, the PPP chairman pointed to their failure in establishing a cardiac treatment facility in Raiwind, their home area, insinuating their tendency to seek medical attention in London.
He suggested an alternative by mentioning the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) in Karachi and proposed establishing a similar institution in Raiwind for the PML-N leader’s prospective heart-related ailments post-February 8.
Highlighting the PPP’s fifth manifesto pledge, Bilawal reiterated commitment to providing free housing for the underprivileged. “We are building two million houses in Sindh for flood-affected people,” he added, promising to extend this initiative nationwide to building three million more houses.
Furthermore, he announced that former president and PPP Co-Chairman Asif Zardari’s “revolutionary programme”, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), would be expanded to introduce the ‘Benazir Mazdoor Card’ for workers and the ‘Benazir Kissan Card’ for farmers of the country.
He further promised stipends for unemployed youth and interest-free loans for students, alongside the initiation of an ‘Ending the Hunger Programme’ at the Union Council level. He asked party workers to convey “PPP’s unique vision and plans to fulfil these commitments to the people of Punjab.
“The PPP stands alone in having the vision and the potential to extricate the country from its current crisis,” he said, stressing that his party was not competing against the other political parties but with the adversities of poverty, unemployment, and inflation.
On Wednesday, the PPP officially nominated Bilawal for the position of prime minister if the party won the general elections. the PPP-CEC, chaired by him, delved into the party’s election strategy in Punjab, seat-to-seat adjustments with like-minded political entities, coalition strategies, and other matters.

2,PTI seeks talks with establishment,Says it has no quarrel with country’s powerful stakeholders,"In a bid to resolve tensions, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan called on Wednesday for talks with the country’s powerful stakeholders ahead of the upcoming general elections, saying the party has no quarrel with the establishment and all it wants is to be heard.
Expressing a desire to address any misunderstandings, the newly-elected PTI chairman said that the party was ready to sit across the table with the powers that be, emphasising that it wants to clear the air and establish a constructive dialogue so that the dust could finally settle down.
The plea for opening a channel of communication has come amid an ongoing standoff between the military establishment and incarcerated ex-premier Imran Khan since his ouster in April 2022. It increased at the time of the appointment of the incumbent army chief and intensified after May 9, 2023, when PTI leaders and workers allegedly attacked country’s civil and military installations.

“PTI has no issue with anyone, including establishment; PTI, Imran Khan and we have consistently been saying that the country is ours, the army is ours,” Barrister Gohar said during an interaction with journalists on Wednesday evening in the capital. He was accompanied by party’s information secretary, Raof Hassan, and other PTI officials.
The PTI chairman, who met the journalists right after his meeting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, shed light on different issues that the party is currently facing and, in response to different questions, reiterated that PTI seeks dialogue with the powerful stakeholders.
During the meeting, Gohar revealed that he has been sitting with Imran Khan inside the cold walls of jail and finalising the names of the poll candidates for constituencies across the country, saying the party would announce the names in a couple of days as consultation with Imran has almost been completed.
‘ECP being used to corner PTI’
Lamenting on the role of the Elections Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Gohar said that ECP has literally become a party against PTI as it not only deprived the party of its election symbol of cricket bat but has consistently been contesting the matter before the courts.
“The electoral watchdog is chasing the case like it had never done so in the past,” he noted, saying “the ECP was being used to corner PTI at all costs.”
He recalled that the PTI conducted the most transparent intra-party elections but out of the total 175 registered political parties, the electoral body only targeted PTI, clearly depicting that all these unjust actions were taken to sideline and push against the wall the most popular political party of the country.

“Giving government to a party having 20 or 25 per cent public support against the party having support of over 70 percent of the nation would be a great injustice to the country and the nation,” he said.Barrister Gohar said that PTI fulfilled all the conditions of the ECP yet it has been deprived of its election symbol.
Emphasising that PTI would contest polls with or without bat symbol and wouldn’t give a walk over to its opponents in the general elections, Gohar, however, admitted that contesting polls with independent candidates would once again open the gates for “horse trading”.
Clarifying that PTI hasn’t shown mistrust on any judge, Gohar urged the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Qazi Faez Isa to take notice of the treatment meted out to PTI and help provide level-playing field. He said that the Supreme Court should immediately intervene to thwart the conspiracy to deprive PTI of its electoral symbol and block the way of horse-trading to save democracy in the country.
He reminded that the apex court had already settled that snatching the electoral symbol was tantamount to dissolving a political party and this right only lies with the apex court under Article 17 of the Constitution. However, he stated: “If our electoral symbol is taken away; all PTI candidates are forced to contest as independent candidates, saying if this happens then who will be responsible for horse-trading after the polls?”

In the absence of the electoral symbol, the PTI chief said that the party could be deprived of a total of 227 reserved that play an important role in the election of the president and prime minister, among others, saying they would go to the party contesting elections on electoral symbol. “PTI could not be deprived of 227 reserved seats come what may,” he vowed.
Meanwhile, Gohar expressed his disappointment over the Peshawar High Court (PHC) verdict, restoring the ECP's order which had stripped the party of its iconic electoral symbol ‘bat’ because it was not just the PTI’s electoral symbol but was also the symbol of the expectations of millions of Pakistani people.
He said that Imran Khan sacrificed his party chairmanship for protecting the party’s electoral symbol “bat” for the people of the country, for democracy and the prosperity and development of Pakistan but to no avail. Barrister Gohar made it clear that all the brutal and unlawful tactics were being used against PTI and its leaders and workers, which clearly indicated that these people were even scared of “PTI’s under-19 team.”
“If you take away the “bat”, the world will not recognise your election,” Gohar said, reiterating that PTI would not boycott the election and contest the polls under any circumstances. He said that the entire state machinery was brought to a standstill to oust the PTI of electoral race because they were well-aware of the fact that PTI would trounce its political opponents conveniently if free, fair and transparent polls were held on February 8, 2024.
