Addressing a press conference in Islamabad alongside the information minister on Tuesday, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the issue could “not be solved overnight in haste or due to someone’s anxiety or someone speaking on social media platforms or even court directives”.
He added that directives had been issued to restart work on the inquiry of enforced disappearances, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered to reconstitute the committee, formed in May 2022.
Mr Tarar, who was also the law minister two years ago, headed the seven-member body, constituted on Islamabad High Court’s instructions.
The then ministers of interior, poverty alleviation and social safety, communications, defence production, maritime affairs and science and technology were the other six members.
While the law minister gave no detail about who would be added to the new committee, he noted the body would have “parliamentary presence”.
Mr Tarar emphasised that when discussing the issue of missing persons, it must be noted that Pakistan was a frontline state in a war-ridden area for the past four decades, adding that the circumstances in neighbouring countries had further exacerbated internal challenges.
The people and army paid an “unbelievable price” in the fight against terrorism with their sacrifices, he said, adding that this must be taken into consideration when finding a solution to the issue of missing persons.
He claimed that of the 10,200 cases sent to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, 7,900 have been solved while 23 per cent were pending.
While acknowledging that “a lot of work remained to be done”, Mr Azam emphasised, “there was no lack of seriousness from the government about the issue”.
The law minister also questioned the credibility of inquiry reports on missing persons.
“Are people who have been registered as missing persons really missing?” he asked, recalling a case in Sindh where people registered as missing persons were actually serving jail time at a prison.

1,Men deciding terms of Nikah put brides at a disadvantage: SC,"In case of any ambiguity in Nikahnama, benefit should go to the wife, Justice Minallah holds.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has ruled that male family members deciding the terms of Nikah on behalf of the bride is “accepted as a cultural and social norm”, but it puts her at a disadvantage in the later stages of marriage.
The order, released on Tuesday, was pronounced by a two-member Supreme Court bench, comprising Justices Aminud Din Khan and Athar Minallah, in the case of determining the bride’s entitlement to a plot mentioned in Nikahnama.
In 2022, the Lahore High Court (LHC) decided in favour of a woman, Huma Saeed, who had married Mohammad Yousaf in May 2014.
Mr Yousaf, who divorced his wife in October 2014, challenged the decision in Supreme Court on grounds that the said plot, mentioned in column 17 of the Nikahnama, cannot be interpreted as part of the dower or gift.

In case of any ambiguity in Nikahnama, benefit should go to the wife, Justice Minallah holds

The title of column 17 was ‘special conditions’, “making it distinct from the other columns which have been specifically provided for the purposes of settling the terms of dower”, the petitioner pleaded.
In his written statement before the SC, Mr Yousaf pleaded that the plot was meant for the construction of a house, and his wife was to live in it for as long as their marriage lasted.
“A plain reading of the description of the property, as mentioned in column 17, does not indicate nor support such a stance,” said the 10-page judgement authored by Justice Minallah.
It added that the question before the bench was how to interpret the terms and conditions of a nikahnama in case of any doubt and ambiguity.
“Its [dower’s] determination at the time of the execution of the [nikahnama] must necessarily be guided by an informed understanding of the bride regarding her rights. The freedom to negotiate and settle the terms by the bride, therefore, becomes crucial.”
Bride’s consent
Justice Minalllah regretted that society’s “paternal tendencies” and “dominance of the male members” in deciding the terms and conditions on behalf of the bride has generally been accepted as a cultural and social norm. “It places a bride in a disadvantageous position, inevitably adversely affecting her capacity to execute the contract with free consent”.
The bench held that a Nikahnama “is the deed of marriage contract” entered into by two parties, and its clauses are to be interpreted “in the light of the intention of the parties”.
“The headings, therefore, are not sufficient to determine the intention of the two parties to the [Nikahnama].”
“The courts, while interpreting the contents and terms and conditions of a [Nikahnama], also have to take into consideration the factor of free consent of the bride and her freedom to settle the terms and conditions as a person having an informed understanding of her rights.”
The judgement added that in case of any ambiguity in the terms of Nikahnama, “the benefit ought to go in favour of the wife” if it was established that she wasn’t informed of her rights at the time of the Nikah.
The bench dismissed the husband’s appeal on the grounds of correct interpretation of the Nikahnama by the LHC.

2,IHC judges look to create bulwark against meddling,"Full court meeting proposes reactivation of ""inspection teams"" to curtail interference in judicial affairs.","• Full court meeting proposes reactivation of ‘inspection teams’ to curtail interference in judicial affairs
• Insiders deny ‘polarisation’ among judges; comprehensive proposal to be submitted to Supreme Court tomorrow
ISLAMABAD: A full court meeting of the Islamabad High Court decided to introduce several measures, including the reactivation of ‘empo­wered’ inspection teams to put an end to the alleged meddling of intelligence officials in judicial affairs.
The meeting, held at the IHC building on Tues­day, was chaired by Chief Justice Aamir Farooq against the backdrop of allegations levelled by six judges of the high court detailing alleged interference in judicial affairs by the operatives of the intelligence agencies. It was not attended by the IHC registrar due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The meeting started at about 2:30pm and continued for over two hours. A statement subsequently issued by the registrar said the judges expressed their views on the matter in a “pleasant manner” and the “unanimous view” of the judges would be submitted to the Supreme Court in the suo motu case.
Senior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Minagul Hassan Aurangzeb, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Jus­tice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejza Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz attended the meeting.
Sources privy to the meeting told Dawn all the high court judges were unanimous that they would not tolerate interference by any intelligence agency in the proceedings of the high court, district courts, and the special courts. They also chalked out a comprehensive proposal, which would be submitted to the Supreme Court by April 25.
The Supreme Court during the hearing on a suo motu case regarding the judges’ letter had sought proposals from the bar associations and the high courts to counter meddling in judicial affairs.
In order to make the court immune from undue influence, the full court decided to reactivate its ins­pection teams and emp­ower inspection judges to enable them to address the complaints of judicial officers of the subordinate judiciary against any interference and pressure, sources told Dawn.
The judges also decided to give institutional response against any interference attempts in judicial affairs, with some of the participants proposing amendments to the rules related to the constitution of benches. The judges also proposed that the Practice and Procedure Act which regulates the bench of the Supreme Court may be followed by the high court so that power to form benches could be shared among the three senior-most judges. The IHC also agreed to give an “institutional response” in future.
One of the participants dispelled any impression of division among the judges and said that all the judges were unanimous regarding the independence of the judiciary and countering the involvement of the intelligence agencies in judicial affairs at all costs.
According to sources, the judges pointed out ins­tances in which the intelligence agencies’ operatives attempted to manipulate the pending litigation in some high-profile cases.
Due to the full court me­e­ting, the proceedings of the cipher case were adjo­u­rned till Wednesday (today).
Suo motu
The Supreme Court has already initiated suo motu action on the letter written by the six judges of the IHC. In the letter, addre­ssed to members of the Supreme Judicial Council, IHC senior puisne judge Justice Kayani, Justice Jahangiri, Justice Sattar, Justice Khan, Justice Tahir and Justice Imtiaz had pointed at the involvement of intelligence agencies in judicial matters.
They had also supported the demand of former IHC judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui for a probe into the “allegations of interference by ISI operatives aimed at engineering the outcome of judicial proceedings.”
The letter pointed out that five judges of the IHC on Feb 12 wrote to the IHC CJ about interference and illegal surveillance of the intelligence operatives and sought a full court meeting.

3,"Low turnout, irregularities abound in by-elections, says Fafen",Report says observers barred from their duties at 19 polling stations in two Punjab constituencies.,"ISLAMABAD: Low voter turnout, procedural irregularities and restrictions on independent obse­r­vation in two provincial constituencies in Punjab overshadowed the improved results management and lower numbers of ballots excluded from the count during April 21 elections in 22 national and provincial assembly constituencies, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said in its report, released on Tuesday.
Polling station establishment, voter identification, and counting at polling stations were observed to have been largely compliant with law and procedures. However, instances of omissions in ballot iss­uance requirements by Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) were reported from around 14 per cent of the observed polling stations.
While polling agents and accre­dited observers generally had acc­ess to voting and counting process, security officials or presiding offi­cers barred Fafen observers from observing the election process at 19 polling stations in PP-36 Wazi­r­abad and PP-22 Chakwal-cum-Tal­a­gang. In PP-22, the accreditation process of Fafen observers was also delayed until the midday on the polling day causing last-minute changes in the observation scope.
Nearly 36pc registered voters cast their votes on polling day — 9pc less than the turnout in 18 of these constituencies during the Feb 8 general elections. Votes polled by women decreased by 12pc, while votes polled by men declined by 9pc, despite an increase of 75,640 registered voters, including 37,684 men and 37,956 women compared to the general elections.

Report says observers barred from their duties at 19 polling stations in two Punjab constituencies

Sharpest decline
Lahore’s five constituencies rec­o­rded the sha­r­pest decline in the vo­ter turnout with PP-147 rep­or­t­ing a mere 14pc as against 35pc on Feb 8. Similarly, NA-119 Lahore registered a 19pc turnout against 39pc on Feb 8. However, the voter turnout in Gujrat and Khuzdar co­n­stituencies recorded an incr­ease compared to general elections.
The declining turnout was accompanied by a reduction in the number of ballots excluded from the count during the by-elections, almost halved (35,574) as compared to the number of invalid ballots (72,472) during the general elections.
The Election Comm­ission of Pakistan issued provisional results for all the constituencies by the legal deadline of 10am on the next day of election, despite suspension of cellular data services in the constituencies in Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh, though KP constituencies did not report any such disruption.
The parties that won during the general elections retained their seats in the by-elections, except in PP-36 Wazirabad and PP-93 Bhakkar. In these constituencies, PTI-backed candidate and an independent candidate had won during the general elections, but PML-N candidates emer­ged successful in the by-elections. These two were among the four constituencies where the margin of victory has decreased as compared to the Feb 8 general elections unlike the rest where the margin of victory has increased.
The by-polls were necessitated due to the death of candidates in four constituencies and vacation of seats by wining candidates in 19 constituencies. PB-50 Killa Abdullah, however, went to re-poll only after a Supreme Court verdict. Of these 24, the ECP notified uncontested returned candidates in NA-207 Shaheed Benazi­rabad-I and PS-80 Dadu-I.
A PTI-backed independent candidate for NA-207 moved court seeking nullification of the uncontested elections claiming that his nomination was wrongly rejected by the RO.
The ECP had set up 4,238 polling stations — 935 for male voters, 899 for female voters and 2,404 combined — comprising 13,811 polling booths to cater to more than 6.3 million registered voters.
Fafen deployed 259 election day observers to observe the voting and counting processes at 1,036 polling stations in five National Assembly and 17 provincial assembly constituencies (12 in Punjab, three in Balochistan and two in Khyber Pakht­unkhwa).
This report is based on the observations received on the election day from 532 polling stations through Fafen’s election day observation mobile app.

4,Foreign loan target missed amid major slippages,"Pakistan receives $9.8bn in July-March, against annual target of $17.4bn.","• Pakistan receives $9.8bn in July-March, against annual target of $17.4bn
• Low inflows mainly due to adverse global environment, poor credit rating
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan received only about $9.8 billion in foreign loans and grants in the first nine months (July-March) of the current fiscal year, far behind the annual target of $17.4bn, amid major slippages in raising international financial support.
The disbursements app­e­ared to be slowing down as the country rec­eived less than $204 million in foreign loans in March compared to $318m in February, acc­ording to official data.
The Ministry of Econ­o­mic Affairs (MEA) on Tuesday said the government could materialise about $6.899bn in foreign economic assista­nce (FEA) in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, almost 39pc of the annual budget target, amid limited borro­wing avenues in the wake of poor credit rating and adverse conditions in the global financial markets des­pite the support of the Interna­tional Monetary Fund (IMF).
This FEA is in addition to $1.9bn released by the IMF out of the $3bn Stand-By Arrange­ment (SBA) and $1bn by the United Arab Emir­ates that is separately accounted for by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Thus, total foreign inflows, including from the IMF and the UAE, amounted to $9.799bn in nine months. This generally works out to be almost 55.6pc of the full-year targeted inflows.
However, the authorities now claim that better debt and trade management have reduced the current year’s foreign assistance requirements. Therefore, its target is now tentatively revised to around $11bn instead of the $17.62bn set in the 2023-24 budget for FEA. They are now predicting the current account deficit to be around $2bn instead of about $6bn budget estimate.
In its monthly FEA report for March, the MEA said the country received $6.899bn in the July-March period against its annual target of $17.62bn. This meant foreign inflows were over 11pc lower than the $7.8bn of the same period last fiscal year, which was otherwise a very tough period given the challenging relationship with the IMF.
The low inflows were mainly due to the adv­erse international environment and Pakistan’s poor credit rating, which make international capital markets a no-go area for Pakistan. Therefore, Pakistan has deferred its plan to launch a $1.5bn Eurobond beca­use of higher interest rates in the internatio­nal capital markets and the country’s low credit rating. The Economic Affairs Division (EAD) report showed that besi­des the $1.5bn in fresh bonds, the government had also budgeted an­other $4.5bn in foreign commercial loans for the current fiscal year.
Total inflows recorded by the EAD in March came in at $218m compared to $333m each in January and February and $1.62m in December.
December 2023 saw three larger disbursements by three major multilaterals — $638m by the World Bank, $469m by the Asian Development Bank, and $255m by Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
The country received $318m in foreign inflows in October and $321m in September. Major FEA during the first nine months flowed in at $2.89bn in July 2023 soon after Pakistan reached an agreement with the IMF for a fresh short-term programme.
Strangely, the EAD had accounted $1.16bn receipt from the IMF in the last fiscal year into its FEA inflows but did not depict similar $1.9bn inflows this year. Interestingly, the EAD had projected $3bn from IMF last year but only $1.16bn could be materialised following the derailment of its programme soon after the exit of former finance minister Miftah Ismail.
For the current year, the Economic Affairs Division had budgeted $2.4bn from the IMF which later actually committed $3bn in the wake of signing of the SBA, which is ending later this month. The Fund has now already disbursed about $1.9bn, leaving behind only $1.1bn to be released this month.
The bulk, or $2.63bn, of foreign loans reported by the EAD in July-March came from Saudi Arabia as a time deposit and oil facility, followed by $1.428bn from the World Bank, $665m from the ADB and a $508m guaranteed loan to Pakistan Air Force (PAF) by China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation. Total inflows from multilaterals, excluding IMF, stood at $2.738bn in the nine months compared to $4bn a year ago.
Inflows from all bilateral lenders, excluding Saudi Arabia, stood at $964m in the nine months. Another $781.5m flowed in from overseas Pakistanis in Naya Pakistan Certificates.
The government has estimated about $17.62bn in foreign assistance in the budget for the current fiscal year, 
including $17.385bn in loans and the remaining $235m in grants. As such, total loan disbursements in the first nine months stood at $6.899bn and $123m in grants.
The EAD said that out of $6.899bn, the bulk of $4.7bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and about $2.174bn as project aid.
During the last fiscal (FY23), the government had budgeted $22.8bn foreign assistance but could materialise only $10.8bn throughout the year — about 46pc of the target — because of the suspension of the IMF programme, leaving a $11.8bn slippage, resulting in depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
Unlike previous years, Pakistan could tap only three major sources of foreign inflows during the last fiscal year, and the trend continued in the first eight months of the current fiscal year as well. These included bilateral and multilateral lenders and overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates.
This also showed that private commercial banks that had shied away in the absence of the IMF programme last year had not returned to Pakistan so far, as the eight-month inflows remained zero against the full-year budgetary target of $4.5bn.

• Iranian president visits Lahore, Karachi; says ‘no power on Earth’ can hurt Pak-Iran ties
• Says Israel will be ‘annihilated’ if it attacks Iran, lauds Islamabad’s stance against Tel Aviv
• US warns Pakistan to keep ‘sanctions’ in mind amid trade talks with Iran
KARACHI / LAHORE: Tehran is ready to exchange its prowess in industry, science, and technology with Pakistan, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said after visiting Lahore and Karachi on Tuesday amid strict security during his three-day trip to the country.
Speaking at a ceremony at the Chief Minister House in Karachi, he said Iran made strides in these fields despite “unfavourable conditions” and was ready to exchange this knowledge with Islamabad.
“I am here with a message of peace and prosperity for the Pakistani nation from the people of Iran and its leadership,” he said, adding, “The governments on both sides are willing to remove all obstacles to expanding trade between the two countries and in this regard, several options were discussed [in his recent meetings Pakistani leadership].”
The visiting dignitary said a strong trade partnership would further strengthen Iran-Pakistan relations, adding that no power on Earth “can affect the historical ties between the two countries”.
He referred to the fresh commitment agreed by the two countries to increase their annual trade volume to $10 billion over the next five years, calling it the “best opportunity” to cement ties across different fields.
‘Routine life disrupted’
At the Karachi airport, President Raisi was received by Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, CM Murad Ali Shah, provincial ministers, and Iranian diplomats stationed in the city. With a large motorcade, the Iranian president was then driven to the Quaid-i-Azam mausoleum where he offered Fateha.
Ahead of his visit, the provincial government had closed all major road links, suspended cellular services in many city districts, and deployed heavy contingency of police and Rangers all across the metropolis. Since the authorities had already announced a public holiday, business activities were badly hit by the security arrangements convincing traders, transporters, and other segments of the community to stay away from routine operations The arrangements “almost paralysed” the entire traffic system of the city as all major arteries connecting to major thoroughfares were blocked with containers. With helicopters hovering over the city throughout the day as part of security arrangements, almost 4,000 policemen backed by the paramilitary Pakistan Rangers squad were mobilised on the ground to ensure “peace and tranquillity and security of the foreign dignitaries”.
Lahore visit
President Raisi arrived in the port city after visiting Lahore, where Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz received him. The Iranian president appreciated the “cultural contributions” and “beauty” of the provincial capital of Punjab.
Here, President Raisi expressed a desire for enhanced people-to-people contacts with the people of Pakistan, as CM Maryam said that the government wanted to take exchanges with Iran in industry and agriculture to “new heights”.
In a meeting with President Raisi and First Lady Jamila Alamul Huda at the Governor’s House, CM Maryam said, “We are willing to work with Iran on economic projects to eradicate poverty. We will also welcome Iran’s investment in Punjab’s value-added livestock market.”
During his short stay in Lahore, he visited the mausoleum of Allama Iqbal, Governor’s House, and Government College University. Mr Raisi said: “I do not feel like a stranger at all. There are special emotions and connections with Pakistani people that keep the two nations connected. I wanted that a public rally be held so I could address the public but due to some reasons, the conditionalities were such that it could not be made possible.”
Mr Raisi further said on behalf of the supreme leader of Iran, “I say my greetings to the people of Pakistan and Lahore.” He said he appreciated the revolutionary spirit present in the people here, adding that Allama Iqbal was “an extremely important personality for Iran as he was a very inspirational person”.
‘Zionist regime’
He also praised Pakistan for taking a strong stance against Zionist forces. “I praise the Pakistani people and government for the stance taken with us (Iran) in a strong manner against Zionist forces,” he said.
Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman also held a meeting with the Iranian president at the Governor’s House.
According to Reuters, which quoted Iran’s official IRNA news agency, the Iranian president said that an Israeli attack on Iranian territory would bring about a complete change of “circumstances”.
“Raisi, who is visiting Pakistan, was quoted as saying such an attack could possibly result in there be nothing left of the ‘Zionist regime’,” according to Reuters.
‘Beware of sanctions’
The US State Department, separately, warned that anyone considering business deals with Iran should be aware of the potential risks of US sanctions, as Washington ‘forbids’ commercial ties with Tehran.
“Let me say broadly we advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions,” said the department’s Prin­cipal Deputy Spokes­person Vedant Patel, when asked about efforts to expand trade ties between Pakistan and Iran.
“But ultimately, the government of Pakistan can speak to their own foreign policy pursuits,” the US official added.
At Tuesday’s briefing, Mr Patel also spoke about a US decision last week to sanction three Chinese and one Belarusian firm for allegedly supplying missile components to Pakistan. “The sanctions were made because these were entities that were proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and because of the means of their delivery,” he said.
