The committee met here with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair.
The other participants included Peshawar Corps Commander Lt-Gen Hassan Azhar Hayat, provincial chief secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry, police chief Akhtar Hayat Khan and other senior officials, according to an official statement.
It added that the forum declared extortion and drug peddling the “areas of most pressing concern for the province” and decided to set up a task force comprising all law-enforcement agencies and increase the powers of the CTD to address the issue.

Observes extortion, illegal forex trade, smuggling fuelling militancy

The committee agreed in principle to legislate in that respect, according to the statement.
It also reiterated its resolve to handle extortionists and narcotics peddlers with an iron hand and agreed on strict action against the government officials involved in the goods’ smuggling.
The participants agreed to reinforce checkpoints and carry out an indiscriminate crackdown on smugglers.
They also decided about the clampdown on the supply of drugs to educational institutions and said a modern rehabilitation centre would be set up in the province for drug addicts.
The apex body decided that the law would be amended to hand down exemplary punishments to narcotics dealers, while action against drug barons would be intensified.
It observed that extortion, illegal hundi and hawala businesses, smuggling, fake documentation, and drug smuggling were fuelling militancy, and therefore, those activities should be effectively checked.

In a statement issued from Wali Bagh in connection with the 94th anniversary of martyrs of Qissa Khwani Bazaar, he said that 94 years passed since the tragedy but the martyrs of the incident had not received justice.
It merits a mention here that on April 23, 1930, the British Empire played a bloodbath in Qissa Khwani. More than 400 unarmed Khudai Khidmatgars and ordinary citizens were killed and more than 5,050 were injured.
The ANP leader said history did not forgive anyone. “Britain must admit the mistake it had made 94 years ago. The bodies of many martyrs were burnt and some were thrown in the river,” he added.
He said that Peshawar city, especially streets of Qissa Khwani, still remembered the sacrifice of every martyr. “Perhaps there is no room for these martyrs in the curriculum but we will always remember them,” he added.
Mr Khan said that on that day they also paid tributes to Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali and his colleagues. He said that under his leadership, Garhwali Rifles Regiment refused to open firing on innocent people. As a result, Veer Chandra Singh was tried for committing sedition and was imprisoned for 11 years, he added.
“Today we must make efforts to give practical shape to aspirations of all the martyrs. The sacrifices of these martyrs forced the colonialists to leave India,” he said.
The ANP leader said that sacrifices and struggle of their elders were a beacon for them. “We will never forget them. We will continue our struggle in every field to protect our soil and achieve our rights,” he added.

4,PHC seeks response of advocate general over expenditure authorisation by cabinet,Fixes next hearing into plea against govt’s move for May 2.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday issued a notice to the advocate general of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa seeking his response to a petition of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz against the recent authorisation of expenditure by the provincial government for a month.
Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Shahid Khan held a preliminary hearing into the joint petition of two PML-N MPAs, including Leader of the Opposition in the provincial assembly Dr Ibadullah Khan and Sobia Shahid, for declaring the government’s expenditure authorisation move unconstitutional and illegal.
The bench fixed May 2 for next hearing into the petition.
The petitioners insisted that the April 5 decision of the provincial cabinet regarding the authorisation of the government’s essential expenditure for the current month of April was against the Constitution and the law.

Fixes next hearing into plea against govt’s move for May 2

They also prayed the court to direct the provincial government to immediately call the provincial assembly’s session for the approval of the essential expenditure for an “appropriate period until the presentation of the regular budget” in the house.
Lawyer for the petitioners Aminur Rehman Yousafzai said that the provincial assembly was dissolved on Jan 19, 2023, by the KP governor on the advice of the then chief minister and a caretaker government was later installed in the province.
He said that piecemeal authorisation of expenditure for four months was approved under Article 126 of the Constitution by the caretaker cabinet for July-Oct 2023 and Nov 2023-Feb 2024, respectively, in July and Nov 2023.
The counsel said that the general elections were held on Feb 8, 2024, and the first meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial assembly was held on Feb 28 for the oath taking of the newly-elected members.
He added that the previous period of the authorisation of expenditure expired on Feb 29 and therefore, the provincial assembly approved the authorisation of expenditure for a further period of one month (March 2024) under Article 125 of the Constitution on March 4.
Mr Yousafzai said that the period of authorisation also expired on March 31.
He contended that after the lapse of a one-month period of authorised expenditure, the provincial government, in order to approve authorisation of expenditure for a further period, opted for the analogy of Article 126, through which a caretaker provincial government was authorised to sanction its expenditure.
The lawyer argued that without following the prescribed constitutional procedure, the cabinet authorised the essential expenditure for the month of April in its meeting held on April 5.
He contended that the provincial cabinet had deliberately misinterpreted Article 126 of the Constitution for ulterior motives in order to frustrate judgement of the high court on March 27, wherein it directed the speaker of the assembly to administer oaths to the opposition members elected to seats reserved for women and non-Muslims in the assembly.
Mr Yousafzai argued that the provincial assembly had been there since Feb 28, 2024, whereas Article 126 of the Constitution, which was exclusively related to a caretaker government when the assembly had been dissolved, had been invoked by the government, which was illegal and unconstitutional.
Meanwhile, Dr Ibadullah told reporters on the premises of the high court that the provincial government had been undermining the importance of the provincial assembly by authorising its expenditure in an illegal manner.
In a reference to detained PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan, the opposition leader insisted that the affairs of the provincial government were run at the whims of a convicted person.
He complained about a delay in the appointment of regular vice-chancellors to the province’s 18 public sector universities and insisted the chief minister had no interest in the affairs of the province.

Addressing a news conference at Landi Kotal Press Club, tehsil chairman Shah Khalid and a number of councillors regretted that the teams constituted for the collection of data of rain-affected damaged structures had not yet initiated the exercise owing to the complicated nature of survey procedure.
Objecting to the procedure devised for collection of data of damaged structures, Shah Khalid said that the teams constituted for the purpose were yet to upload data on a designated website through a mobile phone App as the deadline had passed.
Demanding an extension in the deadline for uploading of data, he also called upon the district administration to improve its efficiency and expedite the process of data collection. “We fear that the survey teams would not cover the entire Landi Kotal tehsil at its current pace with majority of genuine families left out of the survey of their damaged houses and other properties,” he added.
Mr Khalid also accused members of the survey teams of demanding money from locals for their travel expenses. He added that officials of district administration had confined themselves to their offices instead of conducting frequent tours of the affected localities.
He said that chairman of every village council (VC), out of the total 36, had complete data of the respective area and their involvement in the survey of damaged structures could have helped in collecting genuine information about the affected families. He said that village council chairmen had firsthand information about their respective localities.

11,Hospitals paid Rs4 billion by executer of free treatment scheme,Govt has to pay Rs20bn to insurance firm for running the programme,"PESHAWAR: Public sector hospitals have started receiving their unpaid amount in lieu of free healthcare services on Sehat Card Plus from State Life Insurance Corporation after release of funds by the government.
“Since last month, the insurer has paid Rs4 billion to public sector hospitals after receiving Rs5 billion from government. All the main hospitals are treating patients now,” said officials.
They said that SLIC, which implemented SCP in the province, had stopped payment to hospitals after stoppage of funds by the caretaker government. However, the incumbent provincial government of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf started payment to the insurance firm, which started full-fledged free treatment services on March 12 in the province.
Officials said that caretakers had stopped the programme and allowed only three emergency treatments, citing financial constraints. Public sector hospitals had also stopped receiving patients on SCP due to non-payment of their dues by the insurer. The province’s biggest Lady Reading Hospital had Rs2 billion, Peshawar Institute of Cardiology Rs1.5 billion, Hayatabad Medical Complex Rs600 million and Khyber Teaching Hospital Rs500 million in addition to the outstanding amount of district headquarters hospitals and other medical teaching institutions in districts other than Peshawar.

Govt has to pay Rs20bn to insurance firm for running the programme

Officials said that government had to pay a total of Rs20 billion to SLIC due to which it had stopped free treatment services. The government is likely to pay another instalment of Rs2.5 billion to the firm within few days for the month of April. Public hospitals would continue to receive the amount on a monthly basis and keep continue services, they added.
They said that government wanted to focus on public hospitals for treatment of patients on SCP with a view to strengthen the infrastructure as well as benefit doctors and other staff.
“The government has also restricted seven surgeries to public sector hospitals on SCP to put brakes on malpractices by private health facilities,” said officials. Only government hospitals are allowed to carry out common surgeries including caesarean delivery, tonsillectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, cataract, angiography and septoplasty and submucosal resection (SMR).
Private hospitals have been barred from carrying out these procedures to stop malpractices and save the public money as well as health of people. “In some cases, it has come to the fore that private hospitals have conducted these procedures and surgeries unnecessarily due to which they have stopped them,” said officials.
They said that they removed 71 private hospitals from the list of empanelled health facilities for the programme. “There are now 118 empanelled hospitals including 60 public and 58 private. SLIC will pay to hospitals only when it gets funds from government. Earlier, the insurer paid the hospitals despite non-payment by the government,” they added.
With the decrease in number of empanelled hospitals in private sector and restricting common procedures to government hospitals, officials said, monthly cost of the programme would come down from Rs3 billion to 2.5 billion. “It is a major step towards sustainability of the programme. More private hospitals will lose empanelment as the criteria for selection for treatment of SCP has been tightened to ensure that the people get quality services,” they added.
However, public hospitals were required to provide prompt services to patients so that people don’t go to private hospitals for major treatments.

13,Stay order extended in CM disqualification case,High court seeks ECP’s response to petitions of Gandapur,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday extended a stay order stopping the Election Commission of Pakistan from acting against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur over two petitions for his disqualification.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal issued notice to the ECP and sought its response to two almost identical petitions filed by the chief minister against the ECP’s proceedings on pleas of Mohammad Junaid and Ziaullah for his disqualification.
Last month, the court stayed those proceedings.
The bench also disposed of an identical petition by Mr Gandapur declaring it infructuous.
Alam Khan Adenzai, lawyer for the chief minister, said his client had challenged the plea filed by his rival candidate, Kafeel Ahmad, before the ECP.

High court seeks ECP’s response to petitions of Gandapur

He said as the plea had been withdrawn by Mr Kafeel, the petition of Mr Gandapur had become infructuous leading to his decision about its withdrawal.
Initially, the ECP issued a notice to Mr Gandapur asking him to appear before it on March 26 over the petition of Mr Kafeel.
However, the high court suspended the notice.
Two petitions were later filed with the ECP by Mr Juanid and Mr Zia. They, too, were challenged by Mr Gandapur.
Lawyer Adenzai requested that the court declare that the ECP had no jurisdiction to hear the case. He said the petitions filed with the ECP were not maintainable.
The petitioners told the ECP that the chief minister had made a misstatement before the returning officer regarding some of his properties, and therefore, he was neither sadiq (truthful) nor amen (righteous), according to him.
The lawyer said Mr Gandapur was declared a returned candidate from PK-113 Dera Ismail Khan in the Feb 8 general elections, and a gazette notification was also issued by the ECP in this regard.
He said the petitioners before the ECP had sought his disqualification under the Constitution’s Articles 218(3) and 62(1)(F) and different provisions of the Elections Act, 2017.
The counsel contended that after the Feb 8 general elections were over and the gazette notification of the successful candidates was issued, the ECP couldn’t deal with the election-related matters, so the petitions of the respondents were ‘incompetent and not maintainable.
They argued that as Mr Gandapur had been elected chief minister, the ECP had overstepped its powers by entertaining the petition.
The lawyers said after the notification of election tribunals, the ECP couldn’t hear the matter.
REPLY SOUGHT: A high court bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah has sought a reply from the federal government to the petition of PTI leader and MNA Asif Khan against the placing of his name on the provisional national identification list (PNIL) by the Federal Investigation Agency.
It adjourned hearing into the petition to May 8, directing the government to inform the court on what grounds the petitioner’s name was placed in the PNIL.
The petitioner’s counsel, Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah, argued that his client was elected a member of the National Assembly from Peshawar and that he belonged to a respectable family.
The lawyer contended that the petitioner was a law-abiding citizen and couldn’t travel abroad as he came to know about his name in the PNIL.
He argued that there was no justification for the government to place the name of the petitioner on that list and deny him the constitutional right to free movement.

Salim Alizai, a farmer from Topi region, said per day wage of a worker ranged from Rs800 to Rs1,400 during the peak period as landowners wanted to complete the harvest and threshing task as soon as possible as any rain during this period could damage the grain
The farmers recalled that harvested crop in a number of villages was destroyed due to intermittent rains last year, causing them huge losses.
POPPY DESTROYED: The police destroyed poppy crop grown over 15 kanals of land in hilly Qadara area, DSP Jawad Khan said.
He said the police had already destroyed poppy crop in mountainous region of Narangi in Gadoon Amazai.
He said farmers had cultivated poppy in secluded places to hide it from police. However, he said the revenue department officials conducted a secret survey and informed the police about the areas where the poppy was cultivated.
Another police official, who participated in the operation, said the crop was at critical stage of ripening, and that growers were asked not to interfere with the police action.

15,Mansehra road closed for five months,MANSEHRA: The National Highway Authority has failed to clear snow from the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road in the last...,"MANSEHRA: The National Highway Authority has failed to clear snow from the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road in the last five months, blocking the return of the residents of Kaghan Valley from lower parts of Hazara Division, where they migrated after the first winter snowfall last November.
“This snow-hit [MNJ] road usually reopens early in April, but the NHA hasn’t done it this time around, and therefore, we couldn’t go back to start farming and carry out other activities for livelihood,” Maulana Mohammad Haroon from the Battakundi area in Kaghan Valley told reporters on Tuesday.
Accompanied by other residents of the valley, Mr Haroon lashed at the NHA over “failure to remove snow from the MNJ Road despite receiving huge government funds.”
He said the residents, who went to the lower parts of Hazara Division to prevent a harsh winter, were farmers.
“We desperately want to return to our hamlets to grow peas, potatoes, and seasonal crops,” he said.
Another resident, Abdullah Jan, said the local population mostly depended on agriculture and tourism for a living.
Mohammad Manzoor of Battakundi said agricultural lands in Naran Battal, Darsari Naran, Damduma Naran, Soach Naran, Sohni Battakundi, Battakundi Madan, Donga Barawai, Sarian Jalkhad, and Basil areas awaited cultivation.
SHO of Naran police station Raja Sajid said the police were extending “all-out” support to the NHA to clear the MNJ Road to traffic.
He said the artery, which also linked KP with Gilgit-Baltistan, would take two to three weeks to reopen to attract tourists.
Last month, adviser to the chief minister on tourism Zahid Chanzeb ordered the early reopening of the MNJ Road to promote tourism and assess damages from snowfall.
SCHOOLS’ RECONSTRUCTION: Residents of the Nawazabad area here on Tuesday demanded the early reconstruction of the main local road destroyed by the recent heavy rains.
“The Nawazabad-Mandachucha Road was destroyed by the recent downpour, and therefore, authorities should ensure its reconstruction with further delay,” former election candidate Aftab Shah told reporters.
He said the road that led to the upper parts of Siren Valley would be used by visitors in the upcoming tourist season.
Mr Shah said traveling around in the valley was an uphill task due to the dilapidated condition of the road.
“The government earmarks huge funds to construct roads for tourism promotion but is unfortunately ignoring repairs and maintenance of the existing arteries, which are a great source of revenue for it,” he said.
