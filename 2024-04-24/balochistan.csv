3,Top cop assumes charge amid spike in crimes,New Islamabad IGP has set a seven-day deadline for performance improvement,"After the lapse of several weeks and an alarming spike in street crime, the Islamabad police finally got a new police chief at the Central Police Office.
Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, recently appointed as the Inspector General (IG) of Islamabad, officially assumed his duties on Monday following his transfer from the Punjab government to the federal government three weeks ago.
Upon taking charge, IG Rizvi identified three major challenges facing the Islamabad police, affecting their overall effectiveness. The first challenge highlighted was the rising incidents of street crimes, posing a significant hurdle for law enforcement. He emphasised the need to enhance patrol system efficiency rather than solely focusing on apprehending criminals.
The second challenge addressed covert networks involved in theft, robbery, and street crimes. IG Rizvi introduced measures empowering investigating officers to apprehend culprits and recover stolen items, providing relief to citizens.
The third challenge involved resolving over 6,000 pending cases and apprehending more than 4,000 proclaimed offenders involved in serious crimes. He emphasised merit-based appointments for police roles, enhanced patrol monitoring, and strict departmental action against misconduct.
IG Rizvi organised a meeting with police officers upon assuming office, setting a seven-day deadline for performance improvement. He prioritised the welfare of martyrs' families, ensuring their active participation in key events and providing education and scholarships to their children.
Addressing police force concerns, the IG pledged to increase salaries and optimize resources for effective crime fighting and security measures. He established a special implementation committee comprising senior officers to monitor task execution across divisions.
Emphasising field visibility and public service, the new police chief announced 24-hour operations at the F-6 service centre, zero tolerance for corruption, and activation of specialised police units. He also outlined plans for training, performance monitoring, repatriation of offenders, traffic management campaigns, and night patrolling initiatives.
Under the new IG's leadership, the Islamabad police face a daunting challenge to prevent crimes when the federal capital is already reeling under the rising rate of street crime.
In line with the directions of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the Establishment Division removed Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Akbar Nisar Khan in December last year.
It is pertinent to mention here that then-DIG (grade-20) Nasir was appointed as the top cop in the federal capital in May 2022, by the former Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government.
In October, the ECP had asked the interior ministry to transfer the officers after different political parties filed complaints against them fearing they may influence the outcome of the upcoming elections.

4,Call for PSO pumps’ audit after blaze,Inquiry detects gross violations of SOPs during transfer of petrol from oil tanker,"The Islamabad district administration has officially contacted the management of Pakistan State Oil (PSO) for a thorough audit of the horrible fire incident at a filling station in the bustling commercial hub of the federal capital and violations of standard operating procedures.
Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, in a written communique with the Managing Director of PSO, has highlighted the blatant disregard for the SOPs at the PSO pump during the devastating fire incident in the oil tanker.
The letter available to The Express Tribune reveals that an electric spark occurred near the electric cooler while transferring petrol from the oil tanker. The CCTV footage captured the ignition of the surrounding area and the nozzle of the oil tanker caused by the electric spark. Upon investigating the petrol pump, it was uncovered that there were electrical connections near the underground tanks, which could pose a serious risk.
As per the SOPs for filling petrol at a petrol pump, it is prohibited to have an electricity connection in the vicinity. The letter also mentioned that the inquiry committee has been notified about the recent comprehensive audit carried out by the PSO inspection team at the filling station.
The CCTV footage revealed petrol leakage from the oil tanker, necessitating further investigation. There was no backup power connection for the CCTV cameras of the petrol pumps.
The Beverly Centre, which houses numerous restaurants and offices, is located next to the petrol pump. The proximity of the petrol pump to the Beverly Centre poses a risk to the safety of the citizens. To address this concern, it’s crucial to conduct a thorough audit of all PSO pumps in Islamabad. Once the audit is completed and all SOPs are implemented, the concerned petrol pump should be de-sealed by notifying the Assistant Commissioner, the letter states.

8,Court admits Sheikh Rashid’s acquittal pleas,Former minister seeks acquittal on grounds of insufficient evidence in cases about May 9 incidents,"Former interior minister and Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed has filed three constitutional petitions seeking his acquittal on the grounds of insufficient evidence in the cases about the May 9 incidents.
The Special Anti-Terrorism Court while admitting all the petitions for hearing, issued notices to the investigation teams and summoned parties for arguments on the next date of hearing.
Lawyers Sardar Abdul Razaq and Sardar Shehbaz Advocates filed the petitions on behalf of the former interior minister in cases registered at three police stations, including Cantt, Morgah and Taxila, and the hearings were conducted on Tuesday.
Rashid, his nephew Sheikh Rashid Shafiq and 200 workers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), who were nominated in the cases, also appeared. The court granted the request for a hearing and called upon the public prosecutor to present arguments on May 14.
The petitions argued that the former interior minister was not present in Rawalpindi on the day in question and that he was falsely charged in connection with the May 9 cases. It was further contended that he should be exonerated from these charges as there were no injuries reported in any of the incidents and there was no audio-video evidence to support the allegations.
The petitions argued that “these are baseless political vendettas and fabricated cases concocted by the police with no possibility of any of the accused being found guilty in these cases due to lack of evidence and testimonies.”
