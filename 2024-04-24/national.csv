0,Civility returns to NA on private members’ day,Law minister says Pakistan can’t agitate issue of India’s barrage on Ravi; finance czar calls for ‘tax culture’.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday managed to take up the complete agenda on its first private members’ day due to an understanding between the government and opposition as the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle demonstrated civility and mostly listened to each other with patience.
Though the house witnessed a brief ruckus towards the conclusion of the sitting after some women lawmakers protested ‘objectionable’ remarks passed by PTI’s Zartaj Gul, the overall atmosphere of the house remained peaceful.
Lawmakers took up the 18-point agenda, which included introduction of bills, presentation of private resolutions and discussion on the country’s economic situation and strengthening of higher education in Balochistan by establishing varsities, especially for female students.
Shahpur Kandi Barrage
Responding to a calling attention notice moved by PTI members regarding “Indian water aggression against Pakistan by developing Shahpur Kandi Barrage on Ravi River to stop water flow to Pakistan,” Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said Pakistan could not agitate on the matter as under the Indus Water Treaty signed in 1960, India had complete control over the three eastern rivers, including Ravi.
The minister said the treaty had been signed by both countries with the World Bank playing a mediatory role and its implementation was an international obligation. He, however, said the government was resolute in not relinquishing its water rights, emphasising that any alteration to the Indus Water Treaty necessitated mutual consent from both Pakistan and India.

Law minister says Pakistan can’t agitate issue of India’s barrage on Ravi; finance czar calls for ‘tax culture’

The minister claimed that India wanted to revoke the treaty as it wanted to impose a war, but the WB was not permitting New Delhi to do so. He reiterated that the treaty stood immutable unless both Pakistan and India reach a consensus for modification.
Mr Tarar said in the past Pakistan had taken up the issues of Indian violation of the treaty to the WB and got relief in some cases. He gave the example of Kishan Ganga Dam in this regard.
PTI’s Zartaj Gul criticised the minister for saying Pakistan could not agitate the issue, expressing the fear the BJP government would revoke the Indus Water Treaty after winning the elections this time.
Economy
In a policy statement on the economic situation, Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb called for creating tax culture in the country and improving tax-GDP ratio. He said imposing more taxes on tax payers would not resolve the issue.
Stating that the IMF programme could only provide stability and not development, the minister said agriculture and information technology sectors held the potential to contribute significantly to economic growth. He stressed the government’s commitment to facilitating the two sectors and expressed optimism that IT exports would surpass the $3.3bn mark during this financial year.
He stressed the importance of promoting agricultural growth to achieve a rate of five to six per cent annually, in addition to harnessing the potential of the local livestock sector.
The minister asserted that the country’s economic situation had improved compared to the previous year. Regarding economic indicators, he highlighted a 74pc decrease in the current account deficit, which reached $1bn as compared to $3.9bn previously.
He outlined the government’s focus on three key areas for transformation: tax, energy sectors, and reforms in the state-owned enterprises.
Mr Aurangzeb, who had recently returned from the US, affirmed the support of friendly countries both domestically and internationally for Pakistan’s economic growth. He said the inflation had come down to 20.7pc from 38pc and it would drop to 5pc to 7pc by September 2025.
The NA also passed a resolution urging the government to “take immediate steps to ensure the payment of the minimum wages announced by the government in the government-run departments as well as the private enterprises.”

1,SC asked to put National Action Plan into action,"Shu­h­ada Forum Baloc­hi­stan approaches SC for strict implementation of plan, as well as disposal of pending appeals and trials of terrorists involved in anti-state activities.","ISLAMABAD: The Shu­h­ada Forum Baloc­hi­stan (SFB) approached the Sup­reme Court on Tuesday to seek the strict implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) against terrorism and extremism — formulated in 2014 — as well as expeditious disposal of pending appeals and trials of terrorists involved in anti-state activities.
Moved through senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar on behalf of SFB patron-in-chief Nawabzada Jamal Raisani, the petition was filed a day before a six-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, resumes the hearing of a set of intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the Oct 23 unanimous verdict declaring illegal the military trial of civilians.
The petition sought a dir­e­ctive for the federal and provincial governments to establish a robust prosecution system by adopting best international practices for witness protection and early conclusion of ap­p­eals and trials of anti-state elements before all forums, including the Supr­eme Court and high courts.
The petition said the federal and provincial governments should also be directed to pay special monetary packages and make sure free education for the children of martyr’s families in both private and government institutions and to provide them foolproof security when needed.
“These governments should also be directed to take steps and introduce new legislation for controlling illegal menace of promoting terrorist activities on different social media platforms and for controlling fake news by adopting best international practices and establishing an independent authority to deal with such matters after consultation with stakeholders.”

2,"ECP cannot undo decisions  post-election, LHC rules",Court dismisses commission’s order directing RO to recount votes after result announcement.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has ruled that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) cannot undo its own decisions as it lacks the power of review.
Justice Shahid Karim issued the ruling, setting aside an ECP order where it directed a returning officer (RO) to recount votes after the consolidation of election results.
The judge observed that the ECP wrongly interpreted its inherent powers under the Election Acts 2017 by ordering a recount after the conclusion of the election process and the issuance of the gazette notification of the returned candidate.
He noted that sub-section 6 of Section 95 of the Elections Act confers the ECP with the power to direct a returning officer to recount the ballot papers before the conclusion of result consolidation proceedings.

Court dismisses commission’s order directing RO to recount votes after result announcement  

If the ECP doesn’t exercise this power within the contours of this provision, “it cannot thereafter proceed to exercise such power on the misplaced notion that it can do so by invoking provisions of Section 8 of the 2017 Act”, Justice Karim said.
Section 8 gives ECP the powers to conduct free and fair elections.
Justice Karim explained that the ECP is constrained by Section 95(6) and cannot exceed its jurisdiction.
In the impugned order, he said, although the ECP referred to the provisions of Section 95(5) but ignored Sub-Section 6, which relates to the commission’s powers.
The judge observed that the ECP committed an error by stating that the commission may exercise “its inherent power to rectify any injustice committed during the course of the election.”
“This view is a violation of law and must be discountenanced. It cannot be sustained in view of the holding of the superior courts in different cases,” the judge wrote in his detailed judgement on a petition by PTI-backed independent candidate Bilal Ijaz from the National Assembly Constit­uency NA-81 (Gujranwala).
Through a short order, the judge on April 16 allowed the petition and struck down the ECP’s decision to hold a recount wherein Azhar Qayum Nahra of the PML-N was declared victorious.
Justice Karim said it was unfortunate that the ECP passed the imp­u­gned order, ignoring the judgments of the superior courts. He said the ECP is not the only authority tasked with the duties and obligations of holding fair and free elections under the Elections Act.
Therefore, after certain events have taken place, the commission must step aside and allow other bodies to take charge.
The judge observed that the lofty and legitimate aim of holding just and fair elections cannot be taken to confer carte blanche (complete freedom) on the ECP to expand its powers beyond the statutory realm.
He noted that a reading of the impugned order passed by the ECP betrays an increased appetite for accumulating power, which goes against the law’s intent.
The judge ruled that the ECP’s order amounts to reviewing its own declaration of results in the official gazette; therefore, the Election Commission should not have exercised its jurisdiction in the instant case after declaring the results.

3,Cipher case judge may be repatriated over ‘misconduct’,Justice Kayani recommended repatriation of Judge Zulqarnain since the IHC passed certain observations regarding the judge's conduct in a bail order.,"ISLAMABAD: The adm­­­i­nistration of Islam­abad High Court (IHC) has initiated the process to send back District and Sessions Jud­ge Abul Hasnat Moha­mmad Zulqa­rnain to his parent department, the Lahore High Court (LHC), over alleged misconduct.
Judge Zulqarnain convicted former prime minister Imran Khan and PTI leader Shah Mahm­ood Qureshi in the cipher case and sentenced them to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment each, in a hurriedly concluded trial.
Sources in the IHC told Dawn on Tuesday that the senior puisne judge, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, who is also the inspection judge of the capital’s Special Courts, has recommended the repatriation of Judge Zulqarnain since a division bench of the high court passed certain observations regarding the conduct of the judge in a bail order on the plea of PTI leader Aamir Masood Mughal.
Mr Mughal, who was booked in March last year for allegedly leading a group of rioters that set a pol­ice van on fire, applied for pre-arr­est bail at the Anti-Terrorism Court.
During a hearing on Feb 6, Mr Mughal appeared in the court of ATC judge Zulqarnain and requested the court to adjourn the hearing on the petition until after the Feb 8 general elections, in which the accused participated as an independent candidate, backed by the PTI.
The judge accepted the request and adjourned the matter until Feb 13.
The IHC bench, however, noted that “the presiding officer [Judge Zulqarnain] dictated and announced such an order in the open court. However, later they were informed that the said petition [for pre-arrest bail] has been dismissed for non-prosecution”.
According to the order, the IHC asked the petitioner and his lawyers to submit separate affidavits before the court, and they later submitted affidavits affirming the facts.
The court further noted that the investigation officer in the case also confirmed the statements of the petitioner and his counsel that the ATC-I on Feb 6 had adjourned the hearing until Feb 13.
“At this juncture, we will exercise restraint to record observations regarding the conduct of the presiding officer [ATC-I judge] in the light of the principle and law laid down by the Supreme Court. However, a separate note is being submitted on the administrative side,” the order said.

4,PTI denies ‘secret talks’ with establishment,Demands Bushra Bibi be shifted to Shaukat Khanum Hospital forthwith.,"ISLAMABAD: Rejecting speculations about secret talks with the establishment, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan made it clear on Tuesday that the party was neither interested in nor holding talks with anyone.
“Today, I asked party’s founding chairman Imran Khan that if some institutions had contacted him for the talks? Imran Khan clearly said that no one had contacted him,” Mr Gohar said while speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.
He said no one had even contacted him  for dialogue, nor had he received any message for talks from anyone.
“Same is the case with the other party leadership. Even if we receive any message from anyone for dialogues, we will inform the media,” he said.

Demands Bushra Bibi be shifted to Shaukat Khanum Hospital forthwith

He made it clear that whenever PTI is interested in dialogues, they  would be held openly and the media would be informed about it.
In reply to a question, he said Mr Khan did not believe in sharing power and would not make an alliance with any party which has stolen the mandate of the PTI.  However, he said, the party would continue efforts and struggle for the rights of the people of Pakistan.
Bushra Bibi’s health
Expressing serious concerns over the health of Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan, after a team of doctors with an ambulance visited Banigala overnight to examine her, the PTI leadership on Tuesday warned that the rulers would be held responsible if anything happened to her.
Speaking at a press conference, the PTI leaders warned that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, jail superintendent and other authorities would be held responsible if anything happened to Ms Bibi, alleging that the current regime had crossed all boundaries of “fascism and inhumane acts”.
Accompanied by PTI Senator Dr Humayun Mohmand, Naeem Hai­der Panjutha and party’s Women Wing president Kanwal Shauzab, central information secretary Raoof Hasan dema­nded that Mr Khan’s wife be immediately transferred to Shaukat Khanum Hospital and treated by doctors of her and her husband’s choice.
PTI Senator Mohmand questioned the credibility of medical ass­e­ssment reports of Bushra Bibi, alleging that her medical examination had been delayed for two months. He said that if tests were not conducted in a specific period of time, their results could be different.
He said if Ms Bibi was allowed to undergo medical tests when she complained about health deterioration, only then they could accept the test results, adding that she needed a clinical evaluation because here medical examination diagnosed that her stomach layer was inflamed and digestive canal was damaged.
That was the reason doctors suggested a better diet for her and, therefore, the chances of her being poisoned could not be ruled out, he claimed.
Mr Hasan alleged that all st­ate institutions badly failed to per­form their legal and constitutional duties. He said the chief justice inaction and sil­­ence on human rights violations in the country raised many eyebrows.
Mr Panjutha said Ms Bibi had no health issues before her detention and the issue of her medical examination had been dragged for two months with “malicious” intent.
Ms Shauzab said that after the “regime change conspiracy”, a new but alarming tradition had emerged in the country to specifically target women.

5,‘Over half of Pakistan does not have access to internet’,First-ever Digital Development Index reveals over 80pc of women’s phones are ‘controlled’ by their parents or spouse.,"

PLANNING Minister Ahsan Iqbal launches the National Human Development Report 2024, in Islamabad, on Tuesday.—APP

 
ISLAMABAD: Over half of the country’s population does not have access to internet, but districts that perform better on digital transformation are also among the better performing areas in terms of human development, reve­als the first-ever Di­g­ital Develop­ment Index (DDI) report, released on Tuesday.
Prepared in the collaboration with the United Nati­ons Develo­pment Prog­r­a­mme (UNDP), the rep­ort is part of the National Hum­an Develo­pment Report 2024, which was laun­ched by Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal.
The report placed the country in the ‘moderate’ category in terms of digital development and noted that women are underserved by digital development and 83.5pc of whom claimed their spouse or parents dictate their phone ownership.
According to the report, digital development in Pak­i­stan’s richest quintile was 15-fold greater than the po­o­­rest quintile, meaning that wealth is a huge mar­ker of the digital development.

First-ever Digital Development Index reveals over 80pc of women’s phones are ‘controlled’ by their parents or spouse

Islamabad is the district with ‘very high’ digital development, followed by Karachi, Lahore, Rawal­pindi, Peshawar, Haripur and Abbottabad in the ‘high’ category. 
It showed a strong correlation between districts that perform better on digital transformation and those having the higher human development outcomes.
The country has a low Human Development Ind­ex rank of 164 out of 193 countries, coupled with a Gender Inequality Index position of 135 out of 166 countries.
The digital divi­des further exacerbate poor development outcomes, the report noted.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Iqbal claimed the government was committed to harnessing the benefits of technological innovation to improve livelihood prospects, accelerate financial inclusion, improve employment, and deliver efficient public services.
Recognizing digital acc­ess as a fundamental necessity in the modern era, akin to essential services like electricity, healthcare, and education, the minister stre­s­sed the government’s responsibility to bridge the digital divide across all regions.
UNDP Assistant Admin­i­strator and Regional Director Regional for Asia and the Pacific Kanni Wignaraja said that over 60pc of the population in Asia-Pacific was online, with women and marginalised groups being significantly underrepresented. 
“Pakistan is the sixth largest contributor to the glo­b­al middle-class growth between 2022 to 2030, contributing 25 million,” she said. 
“Targeted digital tran­s­formation efforts for this growing middle class could greatly improve the country’s productivity,” she said.
UNDP Pakistan Resi­dent Representative Dr Samuel Rizk said: “Our ambition is to contribute to a future-oriented Pakistan where digital transformation becomes a hallmark of its inclusion, and a cornerstone for its prosperity”. 
The report highlighted that over half of Pakistan does not have access to internet because of inadequate digital infrastructure and affordability challenges and nearly half of the country’s districts have low DDI rankings. Without 
equitable access to digital technology, the report noted, Pakistan’s human development outcomes will remain low and under-served.
