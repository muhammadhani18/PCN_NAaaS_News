0,Inter secure Serie A title in heated derby victory over Milan,MILAN: Inter Milan won their 20th Serie A title on Monday after a 2-1 win at AC Milan with their sixth straight ...,"MILAN: Inter Milan won their 20th Serie A title on Monday after a 2-1 win at AC Milan with their sixth straight derby victory giving Simone Inzaghi’s side an unassailable lead in the standings. 
A goal from Francesco Acerbi and Marcus Thuram in each half proved sufficient to secure Inter’s victory, with Fikayo Tomori scoring a late goal to reduce the deficit. 
The match also witnessed three red cards in stoppage time, with Milan being reduced to nine men as tensions flared, with Theo Hernandez and Davide Calabria getting their marching orders along with Inter’s Denzel Dumfries. 
Inter, who have lost only once in the league this season, hold a 17-point advantage over second-placed Milan with five matches remaining. 
They last won Serie A in 2021, followed by AC Milan in 2022 and Napoli last year. 
“I feel like crying because we worked so hard, we deserve this joy,” said tearful captain Lautaro Martinez. “It’s been wonderful but we have to keep going because we’ve already won a lot of trophies and we want to win many more.”  
For Simone Inzaghi it was the first league title as a manager and on a cold, soaking wet evening at the San Siro he strode proudly in front of a clutch of Inter’s “away” fans in the 75,000 crowd as they roared in delight and fired fireworks from the stands at the final whistle. 
“There are so many protagonists of this success, first and foremost the players, but also the directors and chairman Steven Zhang, as anything we needed during this journey was provided for us,” Inzaghi said to DAZN. “It’s an incredible sensation, we did something incredible and its only right to share it with as many people as possible.” 
Inter have become the second team to win 20 Italian league titles, and will have a second star stitched onto their jersey, after Juventus who are way out in the lead with 36 league crowns. 
Inzaghi’s team did it style, laying waste to the rest of the division and becoming the first team to claim the title by winning the Milan derby and leaving his opposite number Stephano Pioli on the verge of the sack. 
“He was struggling 14 months ago according to the media and look what he has achieved since. I am happy here, I work well and I think the team has margin for improvement,” insisted 2022 Scudetto winner Pioli. 
With outgoing champions Napoli crashing and burning early in the campaign and Milan falling away in the autumn Inter raced off into the distance at the turn of the year. 
Juve looked like putting up a fight but they collapsed in February just as Inter strung together a run of 13 wins which also gave them hope of repeating a deep run in the Champions League. 
Inter failed in that mission as they were knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid in mid-March, but by that time the domestic damage had already been done. 
The future looks bright too as Inzaghi, Martinez and Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella are all set to renew their contracts while smart work in the transfer market and increased revenue have helped mitigate significant financial harm wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Piotr Zielinski and Mehdi Taremi will arrive from Napoli and Porto as free agents in the close season while big stars like Thuram should stay. 
“Crazy feeling, crazy game. We wanted to do it for our fans and we did it. It’s my first league title and I’m very proud of it,” said Thuram. 
The San Siro was packed with supporters from both clubs, with Inter fans displaying two stars to symbolise their impending 20th Scudetto, spelling out a message to their rivals: ‘Our destiny, your nightmare.’ 
The match heated up in the opening minutes as both sides engaged in pushing and shouting following a late challenge on Inter’s Barella. However, play resumed a few minutes later without any bookings. 
After 18 minutes, the away fans erupted after Benjamin Pavard flicked a corner to a completely unmarked Acerbi, who had little trouble heading in the lead for Inter. 
Four minutes after the break, Thuram doubled Inter’s lead by sending a low shot from the edge of the box into the bottom-left corner. 
As the minutes ticked closer to the end, fans set off flares in the stands; the resulting smoke mixing with the persistent rain to cast a misty atmosphere around the San Siro, and just as Inter looked set to see the match out Tomori made sure it would be a grandstand finish when he headed home on the rebound. 
However instead of levelling the match Milan lost their heads, with both Hernandez and Calabria receiving straight red cards in stoppage time. 
Dumfries was also sent off in the closing minutes, but that will matter less to his team who danced and bounced in front of joyous fans. 
BOLOGNA CLOSE IN ON CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
Earlier, Bologna took a huge step towards the Champions League with an impressive 3-1 win at rivals AS Roma. 
Oussama El Azzouzi’s stunning overhead kick and futher strikes from Joshua Zirkzee and Alexis Saelemaekers consolidated fourth place for Bologna, who are nearly assured of a spot in Europe’s top club competition. 
Bologna played in one round of the old European Cup in 1964 but have never competed in the modern Champions League. 
However that looks set to change as they sit eight points ahead of sixth-placed Atalanta, with a top-five finish enough to qualify for next season’s revamped competition. 
Bologna were deserved winners in the Italian capital, outplaying Roma who looked tired after eliminating Milan from the Europa League midweek. 
Missing Romelu Lukaku and with Tammy Abraham starting up front for the first time in nearly a year, Roma struggled to get going and are now looking over their shoulders at Atalanta who they lead by a single point. 
Daniele De Rossi’s side now travel to Udinese on Thursday to finish their interrupted match and then go back across the country to face arch-rivals Napoli in Naples. 
The first leg of their Europa League semi-final with Bayer Leverkusen then follows in Rome on May 2.

1,"USADA wants investigation into China swimming, welcomes WADA lawsuit",NEW YORK: The head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency demanded on Monday an investigation into the World...,"NEW YORK: The head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency demanded on Monday an investigation into the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) handling of 23 positive tests by Chinese swimmers and welcomed the global body’s threat of legal action.
During a nearly two hour Zoom call with the media, WADA fired back at critics and provided detailed explanation of its decision not to pursue sanctions on the swimmers, who tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ) months before the COVID-delayed Tokyo Olympics began in July 2021.
The swimmers weren’t punished after an probe by Chinese authorities ruled the adverse analytical findings, or AAFs, were the result of being inadvertently exposed to the drug through contamination.
A report determined that all the swimmers that tested positive were staying at the same hotel where traces of heart medication TMZ were found in the kitchen. There was no explanation for how the TMZ found its way into the hotel.
China’s 30-member swimming team won six medals at the Tokyo Games, including three golds.
“The whole situation is a tragedy for clean athletes around the world,” USADA chief Travis Tygart said. “They should have announced the viola­tion they should have disqualified the athletes. They should have just provisionally suspended [them].
“Clean athletes look at this system and are just frustrated and upset that a number of athletes at this level can test positive for a substance like this and you can have [China] state security create this excuse and then that gets signed off on by the global regulator. Athletes are calling for a review and an investigation and we have to get to the bottom of how this possibly happened.”
The New York Times also reported on Monday that the White House was calling for an inquiry into the Chinese swimmers and would bring it up when anti-doping officials meet in Washington this week.
WADA conceded it conducted no on-the-ground investigation of its own and instead relied on a China doping agency (CHINADA) report then employed their own scientific experts and external legal counsel to test the contamination theory.
With help from leaders of its science and legal affairs departments and investigative unit, WADA presented a detailed step-by-step analysis of how it reached its conclusion but Tygart remained sceptical.
“We really appreciate WADA opening up and providing some information about their process,” said Tygart.  “It was unfortunately very unsatisfying and actually opened up a whole load of questions... that need to be answered and actually investigated.
“They [WADA] have effectively flipped strict liability on its head. They’ve had an authoritarian government with its secret security system provide defences that they really don’t question.”
WADA and USADA appear on a collision course over the case with Tygart calling ruling a  “potential cover-up” and WADA threatening legal action.
If WADA chooses to go that route, Tygart said bring it on.
“I would welcome it because it would be a lot of fun to see the discovery between the emails and the discussion why they decided not to follow the rules and cover this situation up,” said Tygart. “I had a board member one time say if you’re not being sued or being threatened to be sued, then you’re not doing your job.”

2,President’s Cup to mark return of departmental one-day cricket,"LAHORE: The President’s Cup begins on Wednesday, marking the return to 50-over cricket for departments following...","LAHORE: The President’s Cup begins on Wednesday, marking the return to 50-over cricket for departments following the restoration of the Pakistan Cricket Board’s constitution of 2014. 
Matches of the round-robin stage will be held in Abbottabad and Rawalpindi but the PCB received a lukewarm response with just seven teams deciding to take part after the implementation of PCB’s constitution of 2019 having forced the closure of departments. 
The same seven teams had earlier played the four-day feature of the same event with Sui Nor­thern Gas Pipelines Limited having won the event. 
Before the 2019 constitution came into force, eight teams had traditionally taken part in the one-day tournament but despite departmental sport having been restored, only seven institutions showed interest in rebuilding their teams.  
Among them, Ghani Glass and Higher Education Commission were promoted from Grade II. The other teams taking part include SNGPL, Pakistan Television, State Bank of Pakistan, Wapda and Khan Research Laboratories. 
The top four finishers after the round-robin stage will advance to the semi-finals; the venues for which will be announced closer to the matches, said the PCB. 
“Following the successful staging of the first-class tournament, the upcoming limited overs tournament marks a positive step in the smooth return and rehabilitation of departmental cricket, which should be welcomed by everyone,” PCB’s domestic cricket operations director Abdullah Khurram Niazi said in a news release. 
“The return of department cricket aligns with the PCB Chairman’s policy of reinvigorating domestic cricket across the country, which will lead to more opportunities for younger players and a greater likelihood of new talent emerging.”—

MADRID: Spain’s World Cup winning midfielder Aitana Bonmati was named the Sportswoman of the Year, while Serbia’s Novak Djokovic captured the top men’s honour at the Laureus awards ceremony on Monday. 
Bonmati, who has cemented her place at the top of women’s football by winning FIFA’s The Best, Ballon d’Or and World Cup MVP among other accomplishments, made her way on to the stage for a second time on Monday as the Spanish women’s football team were named Team of the Year for winning the Women’s World Cup last summer, the first female squad to win the award. 
“Our national team is a group like no other — our strength comes from every challenge we have faced, both on and off the field of play,” said Bonmati, who also won the Champions League with her club Barcelona and is the first female footballer to win the Laureus. 
“I want to thank all my team-mates and the staff of my club and national team who have helped me a lot, and because of them I am here today/” 
Bonmati and her team-mates were praised for helping to combat sexism in the Spanish football federation by protesting after disgraced former president Luis Rubiales forcibly kissed player Jenni Hermoso. 
Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady handed Djokovic his fifth Laureus award after the top ranked tennis player enjoyed a remarkable 2023. 
The Serb equalled Margaret Court’s all time record haul of 24 Grand Slam titles after winning US Open last September. 
Djokovic contested all four major finals in 2023, also winning the Australian and French Opens. He was the runner-up at Wimbledon. 
Djokovic, 36, equalled his former rival Roger Federer’s tally at the prestigeous ceremony in Madrid. 
“I am incredibly honoured to have won my fifth,” said Djokovic. “I think back to 2012, when I won it for the first time as a 24-year-old. I am very proud to be here 12 years later, reflecting on a year that brought me and my fans a lot of excitement and success.” 
England midfielder Jude Bellingham, who has taken La Liga by storm in his first season with Real Madrid, was named the Breakthrough Player of the Year, the first footballer to win this award. 
Bellingham is Los Blancos’ top goalscorer with 21 goals across all competitions in his first season at the club. 
Gymnast Simone Biles won Comeback of the Year award after winning four gold medals at last year’s world championships, her first international event since competing at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. 
Biles, a three time World Sportswoman of the year winner, headed to the Tokyo Games eyeing a record haul of six gold medals but returned home with just a silver and a bronze after suffering a crisis of confidence that saw the American drop out of multiple events due to “the twisties”, a type of mental block where gymnasts are disoriented. 
Biles, who is the most decorated gymnast with 37 world and Olympic medals, then took a two-year break from the sport to protect her mental health before making her triumphant comeback at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Belgium last year. 
Tennis star Rafael Nadal’s foundation to help youngsters in Spain and India won the Sport for Good award, while Diede de Groot earned the World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability award. 
The Dutch wheelchair tennis player claimed an unparallelled third consecutive calendar Grand Slam last year. 
Arisa Trew, a 14-year-old Australian skateboarder, won the World Action Sportsperson of the Year award after becoming the first female to land a 720 in competition. 
The Laureus World Sports Awards nominees are selected by the global media, while the winners are determined by the 69 members of the Laureus World Sports Academy. The awards have been presented annually since 2000.

4,Shadab urges Pakistan to learn from mistakes,"During the recently-concluded Pakistan Super League season, where he led Islamabad United to the title, Shadab was batting up the order and he said he felt “more comfortable” at that slot."," 

LAHORE: New Zealand cricketers in action during a net practice session at the Gaddafi Stadium on Tuesday.—M. Arif/White Star

LAHORE: The message is clear: In Lahore, Pakistan can’t rest on their laurels.
New Zealand’s stunning victory in the third Twenty20 International was a reminder that Pakistan wouldn’t be enjoying a cakewalk against the depleted tourists and all-rounder Shadab Khan has stressed that his side will need to learn from their mistakes.
After the opening game of the five-match series was washed out, Pakistan’s bowlers put New Zealand, missing several of their top players due to their involvement in the Indian Premier League, to the sword in the second game.
However, a stirring batting performance from Mark Chapman saw New Zealand level the series in the last game in Rawalpindi and as the teams moved to Lahore for the final two matches, Shadab said on Tuesday that Pakistan needed to bounce back strongly.
“Everyone should accept their mistakes and learn from them … it’s the only way to improve,” Shadab told reporters at the Gaddafi Stadium as both teams held their practice sessions under floodlights ahead of the fourth T20 on Thursday
Pakistan’s loss in the third T20, failing to defend a total of 178 with New Zealand easing to victory with 10 balls to spare, raised alarm bells ahead of the upcoming World Cup in the United States and the West Indies but Shadab said it “wasn’t a surprise”.
“Any team can beat any team on a given day especially in T20 cricket,” he added. “New Zealand might not have big names in their squad here but the ones they have will be the stars of tomorrow.”
Shadab made a sparkling 41 coming in at number five in the third T20, one of the few positives Pakistan had on the day.
During the recently-concluded Pakistan Super League season, where he led Islamabad United to the title, Shadab was batting up the order and he said he felt “more comfortable” at that slot.
“I’ve spoken with the team management about the batting order,” Shadab added.
Pakistan have changed their team management recently and Shadab said that it will take time “for things to settle down as the team management is trying to implement new plans”.
With Babar Azam having been reinstated as captain, Shadab said it would be “up to the team management” to restore him to his former role as vice-captain.
Pakistan are testing several new players in the series against New Zealand as they look to form a strong unit ahead of the World Cup in June and Shadab pleaded for patience.
“Earlier, there were demands that young players should be given chances and now the same people are questioning it,” he said.
“New players should be given a consistent run so we need to be patient,” he added, indicating that with matches to come against Ireland and England, “Pakistan will prepare a strong team to win the World Cup”.
For New Zealand, meanwhile, the series against Pakistan is offering a chance for their bench strength to shine through.
Black Caps’ fast bowler Jacob Duffy told a news conference earlier on Tuesday that “new players are getting the opportunity to learn a lot and it is good preparation for the World Cup”.
“Our performance in the last match wasn’t a surprise for us,” he added. “It was the performance of a strong team”.
That win, Duffy said, had reinforced belief in his side that they can win the series.
“We have the potential to win it,” he said. “There will be good, entertaining cricket in the last two games.”

5,Jaiswal sends timely reminder ahead of T20 World Cup,NEW DELHI: Rajas­than Royals opener Yashasvi Jaiswal roared back to form with a timely hundred against Mumbai...,"NEW DELHI: Rajas­than Royals opener Yashasvi Jaiswal roared back to form with a timely hundred against Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League on Monday to strengthen his claim for a place in the India squad for the T20 World Cup in June.
Jaiswal was India captain Rohit Sharma’s opening partner in the home T20 series against Afghanistan earlier this year but his place looked under threat as he struggled for runs in the IPL — 39 being his highest score in his first seven matches.
That run drought prompted former India captain Sourav Ganguly to suggest Virat Kohli, the IPL’s leading scorer this season, should open with Rohit at the World Cup but Jaiswal showed what he is capable of with an unbeaten 104 off 60 balls on Monday.
“I really enjoyed [batting] from the start and was trying to make sure that I was watching the ball properly and playing my shots,” the 22-year-old said after securing table-topping Rajasthan’s seventh victory in eight matches.
“Some days it’s tough, some days it comes good,” he said of his form and thanked Rajasthan’s director of cricket Kumar Sangakkara and captain Sanju Samson for backing him.
The elegant left-hander smashed seven sixes and nine fours as Rajasthan chased down the 180-run target with eight balls to spare, losing just one wicket.
Mumbai opener Rohit scored just six runs for the five-time champions, who slumped to their fifth loss in eight matches. The India skipper was among the first to congratulate Jaiswal after the match.
Rajasthan captain Samson said they knew Jaiswal’s return to form was just round the corner.
“We knew that it is just a matter of one game,” said Samson, who is also in the running to be India’s wicket-keeper at the World Cup in West Indies and the United States.
“I think the way he batted in the powerplay, he was calm, composed and he knew that things are under control. We knew in the dugout that he is playing some [nice] cricketing shots and he will be fine. Really happy for him.”

KARACHI: West Indies rode on yet another century by skipper Hayley Matthews to win the third  women’s One-day International and secure a 3-0 clean sweep over Pakistan here at the National Bank Stadium on Tuesday.
Matthews, who had also scored a hundred n the first one-dayer, smashed 141 off 149 balls with the help of 19 boundaries to help the visitors post 278-6.
The target proved to be a mammoth task to overcome for Pakistan, who were bundled out for 190, with Muneeba Ali their top-scorer with 38.
The defeat dealt a major blow on Pakistan’s pursuit for direct qualification in next year’s Women’s World Cup, with the national side placed fifth in the ICC Women’s Championship table with not many games to turn their fate around.
After winning the toss and opting to bat first, West Indies lost opener Rashada Williams early, but her dismissal was followed by her opening partner Matthews knitting a 93-run partnership with first-drop Shemaine Campbelle.
After Campbelle departed with 38 against her name, Matthews went on to put up a 111-run stand for the third wicket with Stafanie Taylor, who hit four boundaries for her 47 runs.
Aaliyah Alleyne smashed 20 off just 12 — her innings studded with three boundaries — to help the Caribbean side further consolidate their position in the match.
Spinner Nashra Sandhu was Pakistan’s best bowler with figures of 3-54 in her quota of 10 overs.
Pakistan, in response, never got going and kept losing wickets at regular intervals.
They lost their first wicket in opener Sadaf Shamas as early as in the sixth over and were reeling at 84-4 by the 23rd with both veterans Nida Dar and Bismah Maroof back in the hut without making any meaningful impact.
After Muneeba, veteran batter Aliya Riaz’s 36 runs and Fatima Sana’s 44-ball stay for 23 runs somewhat delayed Pakistan’s whitewash as the West Indies bowled with eight bowlers. Each of them took at least one wicket, with Matthews, Alleyne and Taylor taking two scalps each.
The ODI series will be followed by five T20Is starting from April 26 .

7,‘No Russian fencers at Paris Olympics’,Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdniakov had threatened a boycott after some athletes were barred from competing.,"PARIS: No fencers from Russia or Belarus will take part in the Paris Olympics after those eligible under a neutral banner did not enter for European qualifiers, acco­r­ding to the European Fencing Confederation.
“There are unfortunately no Russian or Belarusian athletes,” EFC president Giorgio Scarso told reporters on Tuesday. “The date for enrolment has passed. The reason for their absence is not known, there was no official declaration of letter to explain it.”
Russia’s fencers last year rejected the  “proposed return format” set out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to come back to international competition, raising the possibility they would boycott Olympic qualifying events.
Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdniakov, a four-time Olympic sabre champion, had threatened a boycott after some athletes — including his own Olympic gold medal-winning daughter Sofia — were barred from competing.
The IOC had offered Russians the chance of competing in Paris as neutral athletes without the national flag or anthem as long as they did not publicly support the war against Ukraine and were not employed by the military or security services.
“No Russian fencers will go to these Olympic Games,” Russian fencing federation head Ilgar Mame­dov said. “We have made our principled position clear: we are not going to divide our team into those who please the West and those who, in their opinion, are ‘bad Russians’.”
Six places at Paris Games are up for grabs at the European qualifying event in Differdange, Luxe­mbourg, over the weekend.

8,Warner says mammoth IPL scores won’t be replicated at World Cup,NEW DELHI: Austra­lia’s David Warner says the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies will not see the...,"NEW DELHI: Austra­lia’s David Warner says the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies will not see the same mammoth scores built on flat pitches in this year’s Indian Premier League.
The current edition of the world’s richest cricket tournament has seen monumental totals, including Sunrisers Hyderabad twice breaking IPL records with 277 and 287.
Warner’s Delhi Cap­itals were at the receiving end of another run-fest when Hyderabad posted 266-7 at the weekend, courtesy of a 32-ball 89 by fellow Australian Travis Head.
But veteran opening batsman Warner said the pitches in the West Indies will have something for the bowlers when T20’s showpiece global event begins on June 1.
“They can be slower and they’re gonna turn a bit,” Warner, 37, told reporters, leaning on his experience in the Cari­bbean Premier League. “The wickets tend to get a little bit lower and slower.”
Australian batters Head and up-and-coming Jake Fraser-McGurk have scored at strike-rates of 216 and up to pummel the opposition IPL bowlers.
Warner has not been at his best with 167 runs for the season so far at a strike-rate of 135.77, but he said the anchor role will be key in the West Indies.
“Even when we played there in the 2010 World Cup, the pitches weren’t high-scoring,” he said. “That’s when you did need an anchor, someone like Mike Hussey came out and scored runs for us. He had to come and sort of knock it around.”
Warner added:  “It’s gonna be completely different there. Add the natural elements as well. They’re going to be predominantly day games, I think, because of the timings. So that plays a big factor.”
Hyderabad, who won the IPL in 2016 under Warner, and their batsmen have redefined T20 scoring with their ability to hit nearly every ball out of the park.
Twice this year the team have hit a match-record 22 sixes and at Delhi’s Feroz Shah Kotla ground they hammered an IPL-record 125 runs in the first six overs.
“The wickets have been very good. They’ve been very flat, very compact and very high-scoring,” said Warner. 
“And when you’ve got small boundaries, you’re going to see very high scores.
“Back in the day there used to be turn and you couldn’t get those scores,” he added. 
“Also, the lacquer on the ball is staying longer and hence it’s not getting chewed up, and hence very little turn on offer.”

The bowling all-rounder has starred for Kolkata Knight Riders as an opening batsman, with 286 runs including a century and a half-ton in the current IPL.
He has taken nine wickets with his mystery spin and stifled opposition run flow with an economy of 7.10 in a high-scoring season.
West Indies captain Rovman Powell had urged the 35-year-old to make a comeback for the World Cup in June, which the West Indies will co-host with the United States.
“I’m truly flattered and humbled that my performances recently have moved many people to publicly express their wish for me to come out of retirement and play in the upcoming T20 World Cup,” Narine wrote on social media.
“I have made peace with that decision and whilst I never wish to disappoint, that door is now closed and I will be supporting the guys who take the field in June for West Indies.”
Narine announced his international retirement in 2023, four years after he last played a T20 for the West Indies.
He added in his post:  “Guys who have worked hard for the past few mon­ths and deserve to show our wonderful fans that they are capable of winning another title, I wish you all the best.”

10,"As Olympics near, Macron says Seine will be clean enough for him","CHAMPIGNY-SUR-MARNE: French president Emmanuel Macron, who has repeatedly promised to take an Olympic swim in the...","CHAMPIGNY-SUR-MARNE: French president Emmanuel Macron, who has repeatedly promised to take an Olympic swim in the Seine, on Tuesday said the river was on the way to becoming  “clean”.
Macron was responding after Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera unveiled a rainwater treatment plant on the Marne, which flows into the Seine just east of Paris.
She declared that ensuring the two rivers are fit for swimming was  “one of the challenges of the century”.
On his X account, Macron expressed his satisfaction at this  “key step towards making the Seine swimmable”. 
“The water in the Seine will be cold... but clean”, he wrote.  “I will be able to confirm it personally.”
The Olympic open-water races and triathlon swims will be held on a scenic stretch of the river through the heart of Paris where last summer the bacteria levels passed the city’s safe maximum.
The cleanliness of the river is highly dependent on the weather. Heavy rain washes pollution off the banks and also forces drains and waste pipes to back up into the river.
Storms just before events could lead to Olympic postponements or cancellations.
At the opening on Tuesday, Oudea-Castera pointed out there were 94 days to go to the Olympics.
“We are ready, on time,” she said.  “We will be ready to meet our legacy.”
The plant on the Marne, designed to clean water, would handle  “the equivalent of an Olympic swimming pool per hour,” said Olivier Capitanio, President of the Val-de-Marne Department.
A huge cistern for overflow water at Austerlitz on the eastern fringe of central Paris has been designed to hold the equivalent of 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water.
The measures to clean up the two rivers should also enable local residents to bathe in them, something they have not been able to do in the Marne since 1970 and in the Seine since 1923.
Macron is not the first French leader to say he will make the Seine clean enough to bathe in.
In 1990, when he was Paris mayor before becoming president, Jacques Chirac promised the river would  “soon” be fit for swimming and said he would celebrate by taking a dip. He never did.
