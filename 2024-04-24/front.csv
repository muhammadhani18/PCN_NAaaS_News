1,All IHC judges agree on agencies' ‘interference',Full court decides to chalk out SOPs to deal with issue in future,"Islamabad High Court judges on Tuesday unanimously acknowledged that intelligence agencies were “interfering” in their judicial functions.
A full court meeting was held at the IHC under the chairmanship of its Chief Justice Aamer Farooq in view of the Supreme Court's decision wherein proposals were sought from high courts as how to protect the independence of judiciary from the “interference” of agencies.
Earlier, both the Lahore and Peshawar high courts held full court meetings to discuss the matter.
It has been learnt that the IHC full court meeting was held in a pleasant environment. All eight judges of the IHC agreed that the interference of agencies in judicial functions would not be tolerated. They also decided to chalk out new standard operating procedures (SOPs) on how the judiciary would respond in case the agencies “meddle” in its affairs in the future.
Sources told The Express Tribune that inspection judges were not empowered in the past. Now they have been given the authority to recommend to the IHC CJ on what action to take against those who interfered in the functions of the judges of district courts.
They will share their proposals as to how the independence of judiciary can be secured.
On March 25 this year, six IHC judges wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council seeking guidance to counter the interference of intelligence agencies in their affairs.
They also suggested holding a judicial convention on this subject.
Instead of giving an 'institutional response', the Supreme Court, by majority, approved the formation of an inquiry commission to investigate into the six IHC judges’ letter.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa also held meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss this matter.
However, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani recused himself from heading the inquiry commission in this issue.
Following his recusal, the top court took suo motu notice of the matter.
During the first hearing, CJP Isa justified all his steps after the six IHC judges’ letter.
However, SC’s Justice Athar Minallah dissented with his steps and held that the burden was on the executive to ensure that nobody was interfering with judicial functions.
It is being witnessed that a malicious drive has started against Justices Athar Minallah and Babar Sattar of the IHC, one of the six judges who wrote that letter, on social media.
Their family details are being shared on social media but the government institutions are silent on this campaign.
Interestingly, when CJP Isa faced criticism on account of the SC’s January 13 order, the government formed a joint investigation team (JIT) to inquire into the matter.
Superior bars, which were raising their voice in favour CJP Isa after the January 13 order, are silent on the malicious online campaign against the IHC judge and Justice Minallah.
A lawyer believes that the government needs to understand that the executive always loses the battle with judges as was witnessed in the cases of former CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and the incumbent one, Justice Isa, in these matters.
A debate is raging as to whether or not the judges have gained more independence during CJP Isa’s tenure.
It is a fact that CJP Isa could not give an appropriate institutional response in the matter of the six IHC judges’ letter.
It is a major test for the judiciary as to how the independence of the IHC judges will be secured in the coming days.
Lawyers believe that the six IHC judges have achieved their purpose as the issue of the intelligence agencies’ “interference” has been highlighted through suo motu proceedings.
If the inquiry commission had worked, then its findings could have come against the six IHC judges.
In a related development, the IHC has decided to send Judge Abual Hasnat Zulqarnain, who presided over the proceedings of a special court established to hear the cases filed under the Official Secrets Act and handed down 10-year jail sentences each to PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and party vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, back to his respective department.
Special Courts Inspection Judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani has sent a recommendation to the IHC CJ.
The recommendation stated that the services of Judge Zulqarnain should be returned to the LHC.

The Iranian president was the first head of state from Iran to visit Pakistan since 2017. His visit came against the backdrop of a host of developments, including tit-for-tat missile strikes between Iran and Pakistan in January and brewing tensions in the Middle East.
President Raisi, during his three-day trip, held wide-ranging talks with Pakistani leadership and travelled to Lahore and Karachi. Despite the US veiled threats of possible implications for Pakistan seeking closer ties with Iran, the two countries in the joint statement agreed on a series of measures to boost their bilateral cooperation.
“Both sides agreed to enhance mutual interaction through regular exchange of high-level visits to strengthen fraternal relations,” read the joint communiqué.
The joint statement, highlighting the historical, cultural, religious and civilisational ties between the two neighboring and Muslim countries, said the two sides reiterated their commitment and dedication to further strengthening the bonds through the promotion of academic, cultural and tourism activities, and by enhancing tourism to historic religious sites in both countries.
Acknowledging that the Pakistan-Iran common border should be the ‘border of peace and friendship’, both the sides reiterated the importance of forging regular cooperation and exchange of views between political, military and security officials of the two countries to combat threats such as terrorism, narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, hostage-taking, money-laundering and abduction.

They also reiterated the importance of cooperation in the energy domain, including trade in electricity, power transmission lines and IP Gas Pipeline Project.
The two leaders agreed to boost their bilateral trade to $10 billion over the next five years. Both sides underscored the imperative of a long-term durable economic partnership and collaborative regional economic and connectivity model, particularly for socio-economic development in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province and Pakistan’s Balochistan province.
With a view to further strengthening bilateral economic cooperation, both sides agreed to expeditiously finalise the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and hold the next sessions of Annual Bilateral Political Consultations (BPC) and Joint Business Trade Committee (JBTC) as well as the 22nd round of the negotiations of the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) in the near future.
They also agreed to facilitate regular exchange of economic and technical experts, as well as delegations from Chambers of Commerce from both countries to intensify economic cooperation. The declaration of ‘Reemdan border point’ as an international border crossing point under TIR and opening of the remaining two border sustenance markets was also agreed.
There was consensus to fully operationalize barter trade mechanisms between the two sides to facilitate economic and commercial activity, particularly under ongoing collaborative endeavours, such as border sustenance markets, which would contribute towards improvement of the economic situation of local residents, and further constitute a step towards enhancing border security.
Pakistan and Iran stressed the importance of harnessing their respective geographic locations for promoting connectivity between the two countries as well as with the broader region.
The two sides noted with satisfaction the progress made in the regular shipment of goods under the TIR Convention and agreed to fully operationalize the Convention to further promote efficient, speedy and barrier-free trade between Pakistan and Iran.
It was agreed that full operationalisation of the TIR Convention would also enhance regional integration and connectivity across the wider ECO region.
As members of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), the two countries expressed firm resolve to enhancing cooperation in connectivity, infrastructure development and energy sectors. The two countries also agreed to expand mutually beneficial and enduring linkages between the sister ports of Gwadar and Chahbahar.
While condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, both sides recognised that terrorism posed a common threat to regional peace and stability and presented a major impediment to the development of the region.
It was agreed to adopt a collaborative approach to confront this menace and to leverage the existing bilateral institutional mechanisms to effectively combat and counter this threat, while fully upholding the principles of the UN Charter, particularly the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states.
Both the sides also acknowledged the key role of enhanced economic and commercial opportunities in improving the security environment in the border areas.
Taking note of developments at regional and global levels, both the sides stressed the importance of peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy to find mutually acceptable solutions to common challenges.
Both sides highlighted the need to resolve the issue of Kashmir through dialogue and peaceful means based on the will of the people of that region, and in accordance with international law.
Both the sides expressed their strong and unequivocal condemnation of the ongoing Israeli regime’s aggression and atrocities against the Palestinian people, along with the inhumane blockade of Gaza that has resulted in widespread death and destruction as well as displacement of millions of Palestinians.
They called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access to the besieged people of Gaza, return of the displaced Palestinians, as well as ensuring accountability of the crimes being committed by the Israeli regime. They reiterated their support for a just, comprehensive, and durable solution based on the aspirations of the people of Palestine.
While highlighting the importance of regional cooperation for economic development, the two sides acknowledged that the ECO region possessed immense potential for the development of the economies of the member countries, and called for active cooperation among the regional countries within the framework of ECO.
They shared the view that cooperation between SCO and ECO could play a valuable role in accelerating the progress and development of the entire region.
Both the sides reaffirmed their commitment to the development of Afghanistan as a peaceful, united, sovereign and independent state, free from the threats of terrorism and drug trafficking.
Noting that the existence of terrorist organisations in Afghanistan poses a serious threat to regional and global security, the two sides reaffirmed their willingness to enhance cooperation on counterterrorism and security and to develop a united front against terrorism.
The two sides also noted the relevance of coordinating regional and international efforts to ensure security and stability in the region, and emphasised the positive contribution of existing regional forums towards this end.

The two sides strongly condemned the attack on the Consular Section of the Iranian embassy in Damascus, which was an unacceptable violation of the sovereignty of Syria and undermined its stability and security.
They agreed that the attack was a violation of international law and the UN Charter, and was illegal under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.
Recognising that the irresponsible act of the Israeli regime forces was a major escalation in an already volatile region, both the sides called on the UN Security Council to prevent the Israel regime from its adventurism in the region and its illegal acts attacking its neighbours and targeting foreign diplomatic facilities.
The two sides condemned rising incidents of Islamophobia, desecration of the Holy Quran and sacred symbols in some countries. They also emphasised that advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence must not be allowed under the pretext of freedom of expression.
They welcomed the adoption of the UN General Assembly Resolution 78/264 titled “Measures to Combat Islamophobia” in this regard and called for an early appointment of a United Nations Special Envoy to combat Islamophobia, as well as implementation of other relevant measures contained in the resolution.
Iran also expressed its appreciation for Pakistan on the initiative to adopt the Resolution on “Measures to Combat Islamophobia” in the UN General Assembly.
Iran and Pakistan called on the United Nations Security Council to take action against Israel, saying it had “illegally” targeted neighbouring countries and foreign diplomatic facilities. The joint statement, released by the Foreign Office, followed a three-day visit to the country by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East.

3,Opposition wins PAC chair in power-sharing deal,"Govt, opposition strike balance in NA committee assignments","The government and the opposition in the National Assembly finalised their negotiations for a power-sharing formula and agreed to the framework for the composition of the standing committees of the lower house of parliament.
The formation of the standing committees would complete the government formation process. According to documents available with The Express Tribune, both sides agreed to allocate the chairmanship of 26 committees to the treasury and 11 to the opposition.
As per the agreed formula, the all-powerful Public Accounts Committee (PAC) would be led by an opposition lawmaker, while the Kashmir committee would be led by a treasury member. The National Assembly speaker would himself chair the House Business Advisory Committee.
The PAC would comprise 23 members—16 from the treasury benches and seven from the opposition. Its chairman would be an opposition lawmaker, for which the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had named Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) head Sahibzada Hamid Raza.
Previously, it was reported that the PTI founder had named Sher Afzal Marwat for the post, but, according to the sources, he withdrew his decision and now instructed National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan to nominate Raza for the PAC chairmanship.
Following the new nomination, opposition lawmakers—the PTI-backed independent members of the National Assembly, Zain Hussain Qureshi and Sher Afzal Marwat, and SIC chief Hamid Raza met with the speaker and discussed with him the formation of the house committees.
During that meeting, the opposition proposed the name of the SIC chief to the speaker for the post of PAC chairman. However, Ayaz Sadiq emphasised that the PAC chief would be elected according to the rules, as the speaker had no authority in that process.

“I simply want to resolve the issue of parliamentary committees with mutual understanding,” the speaker told the opposition delegation. Later, the delegation also met with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) parliamentary leader Khawaja Asif.
It was also reported earlier that the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), another opposition party, had floated the name of Noor Alam Khan for the PAC top slot. It was stated at that time that the ruling coalition was seemingly throwing its weight behind Khan for the race.
As per the documents, the government’s 26 committee chairmanships would be distributed among the allies in the ruling coalition in accordance with their strength in the house. The PML-N would, of course, retain the lion’s share of 14 chairmanships.
Among other coalition partners, eight chairmanships would go to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), two to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), and one each to the PML-Quaid and the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP).
Similarly, the opposition’s 11 committee chairmanships would be distributed among two parties. The PTI-backed independents would get an overwhelming majority of 10 chairmanships, while one chairmanship would be given to the JUI-F.
According to the documents, out of the 20 members of each committee, 14 would be taken from the government side – at least seven of the PML-N, four of the PPP, and one each of the PML-Q and the MQM. Six would be taken from the opposition – five independents and one of the JUI-F.
The rules and regulations committee would consist of 22 members – 15 from the government and seven from the opposition. The government assurances committee would consist of 16 members – 11 from the government side and five from the opposition.
Similarly, the house and library committee would consist of 13 members, including nine from the government and four from the opposition. Among the 22-strong Kashmir committee, the government's quota was 15 members, and the opposition's share would be seven.
The House Business Advisory Committee, to be chaired by Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, would comprise 26 members. In the committee, 18 members would come from the treasury benches, while eight members would be taken from the opposition benches.

4,PM urged to reconcile with Adiala inmate,"Business leader encourages Shehbaz: shake hands with Imran, India","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was urged on Wednesday to extend an olive branch to his political rival, the incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Imran Khan, in a bid to foster national stability.
The call for reconciliation came during PM Shehbaz Sharif's day-long visit to Karachi, where he engaged with the business community, addressing their concerns and seeking input on trade and economic matters.
During a Q&A session, business magnate Arif Habib praised PM Shehbaz's past efforts, especially his role in securing a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in his previous tenure.

I think these two steps will yield positive results,"" remarked Habib.
Imran Khan, the PTI founder and former premier, remains behind bars facing a slew of criminal charges, including violations of the Official Secrets Act, terrorism, and corruption.
The prime minister invited the business community to collaborate with the government to resolve their issues and challenges, asserting that this was the only way to progress and bring development and prosperity to Pakistan.
""We should come together in the larger interest of the country, and our brilliant minds should work together to find ways to resolve the challenges and problems hindering the country's development and prosperity,"" he added, noting that this was the only path to regain lost glory.
Regarding the sugar situation in the country, the prime minister stated that the government would consider exporting the commodity if there is a surplus stock. He also emphasised the government's efforts to curb smuggling of the commodity.
