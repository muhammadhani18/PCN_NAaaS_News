0,"Gaza protests grow at US colleges, thousands demonstrate in Brooklyn",Protests follow mass arrests of demonstrators at some East Coast universities in recent days,"Protests against Israel filled streets in Brooklyn and escalated at universities across the United States, some of which included Jewish Passover Seders, as demonstrators demanded an end to civilian casualties in Gaza.
The growing protests follow mass arrests of demonstrators at some East Coast universities in recent days and show a deepening dissatisfaction in the United States, historically Israel's most important ally, with the course of the war with Hamas.
Pro-Palestinian protests have followed President Joe Biden, a self-declared ""Zionist,"" for months. At universities, protests have recently grown to encampments that draw students and faculty of various backgrounds, including of Jewish and Muslim faiths, that host teach-ins, interfaith prayers, and musical performances.
A large Brooklyn street protest reached a standoff on Tuesday when New York police began to arrest people over disorderly conduct, restraining those who refused to move with zip ties.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the use of police force to stifle dissent, saying it undermined academic freedom.
""So does defaming and endangering Jewish, Muslim and Palestinian ... students based on suspiciously inflammatory remarks that a few unidentified, masked individuals have made outside of campus,"" Afaf Nasher, executive director of CAIR in New York, said in a statement.
Critics of the protests, including prominent Republican members of the U.S. Congress, have stepped up accusations of antisemitism and harassment by at least some protesters. Civil rights advocates, including the ACLU, have raised free speech concerns over the arrests.
There have been heated exchanges of words and insults between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators, particularly in the public streets around Columbia, leading congressional Republicans on Tuesday to demand that Biden do more to protect Jewish students.
Several campus protesters Reuters spoke to attributed the off-campus incidents to rogue provocateurs who are trying to hijack the protests' message.
""There are no universities left in Gaza. So we chose to reclaim our university for the people of Palestine,"" said Soph Askanase, a Jewish Columbia student who was arrested and suspended for protesting. ""Antisemitism, Islamophobia and racism, in particular racism against Arabs and Palestinians, are all cut from the same cloth.""
Other students blamed universities for failing to protect their right to protest or stand up for human rights.
""As a Palestinian student, I too did not feel safe for the past six months, and that was as a direct result of Columbia's one-sided statements and inaction,"" said Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student at Columbia.
Students at the University of California, Berkeley - a school well known for its student activism during the 1960s - set up tents in solidarity with protesters at other schools.
Milton Zerman, 25, a second-year student at Berkeley's law school, who is from Los Angeles, said Jewish and Israeli students have suffered from hateful harassment.
""When you're an Israeli student on this campus, you feel like you have a target on your back, you feel unsafe and it's no wonder students from Israel are so hesitant to come here,"" Zerman said.
New York police arrested more than 120 protesters at New York University on Monday and more than 100 at Columbia University last week. Columbia cancelled in-person classes at its Upper Manhattan campus on Monday in a bid to defuse tensions.
On Tuesday, Columbia said classes for the rest of the year would be hybrid, with students able to attend online or in person.
Later, the university's president said it was time “to move forward with a plan to dismantle” the pro-Palestine encampment, and gave organizers a midnight deadline to do so.
California's Cal Poly Humboldt, a public university in Arcata, was shut down after pro-Palestinian protesters occupied a campus building.
At the University of Minnesota campus in St. Paul, police cleared an encampment after the school asked them to take action, citing violations of university policy and trespassing law.
Passover protests
Some Jewish demonstrators said they were taking the second night of the weeklong feast of Passover, a holiday feast when families gather and celebrate the biblical account of the Israelites' freedom from Egyptian slavery, to reaffirm their faith and distance themselves from the Israeli government's war strategy.
""I don't see what Israel is doing as self-defence. I see incredible, absolutely unbelievable human rights violations,"" said Katherine Stern, 62, of Woodstock, New York, who gave up her family Seder 120 miles (190 km) away to attend the Brooklyn protest.
Protesters want university endowments to divest from Israeli interests and the United States to end or at least condition Israeli military aid on improving the plight of Palestinians.
Hamas resistance group attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 and taking scores of hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's counterattack has killed over 34,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry, displacing nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million people and causing a humanitarian crisis.
In Brooklyn, about 2,000 people occupied a plaza near the Brooklyn home of US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a staunch Israel supporter and the highest-ranking Jew in the US government, chanting, ""Stop arming Israel,"" ""Stop funding genocide"" and ""Let Gaza live.""
Organizers staged music and songs from Jewish and other cultures, giving prominence to Canadian author Naomi Klein, a peace activist who drew on her Jewish roots to argue against Zionism, which she called a ""false idol.""
""We want freedom from the project that connects genocide in our name,"" Klein said to cheers. ""We seek to migrate Judaism from an ethnostate that wants Jews to be perennially afraid ... or that we go running to its fortress, or at least keep sending them the weapons and the donations.""

1,"CPEC-II phase promotes joint ventures, PM","Hopes for industrial, scientific progress, green development","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said the second phase of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC-II) offered an opportunity to the private sectors of both countries to form joint ventures.
He underscored that CPEC had contributed to Pakistan’s socio-economic development as well as the progress and prosperity of the peoples of two countries.
He hoped that the Phase-II of CPEC would result in more industrial, scientific and green development in the country.
Talking to a high level delegation of the Chinese International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), led by its Chairman Luo Zhaohui which called on him, the prime minister said China was Pakistan’s most trusted friend and appreciated its steadfast support to Pakistan.
Acknowledging CIDCA’s pivotal role in bolstering Pakistan’s economic development, the prime minister specifically commended CIDCA for its vital support during the 2022 floods and for its relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts in Pakistan.
Earlier, he also witnessed the signing ceremony of four Memorandums of Understanding focusing on flood rehabilitation, information and communication technologies, Juncao Technology, China-Pakistan Development Cooperation Planning (2024-2028) alongside a Letter of Exchange on the establishment of a First Aid Centre in Balochistan, and Protocol on Cooperation in Human Resources Development under the Global Development Initiative.
The agreements signify the deepening cooperation between Pakistan and China across various sectors, a PM Office news release said.
Chinese Ambassador in Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, federal ministers for Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, Finance, Interior and Planning & Development, SAPM Tariq Fatemi and senior officials attended the meeting.
Separately, the premier invited the Australian companies and experts to share their expertise and best practices with Pakistani counterparts.
He was talking to High Commissioner of Australia Neil Hawkins who paid a courtesy call on him at the PM House.
The prime minister said both Pakistan and Australia enjoyed friendly and cordial ties. He expressed satisfaction over the current state of bilateral relations, saying Pakistan was keen to enhance cooperation in agriculture, livestock, mining etc.
The prime minister also acknowledged the contribution of Pakistani diaspora in Australia, including a significant number of students.
The high commissioner reaffirmed the desire of the Australian side to strengthen its ties with Pakistan and assured the prime minister of his cooperation.
He also praised the valiant efforts of Pakistani security guards whose bravery saved many lives during the recent stabbing attacks in Sydney. One Pakistani security guard lost his life while another was injured during the attack in which five women were killed.
He also briefed the prime minister on some of the upcoming bilateral engagements, including visits of senior Australian defence officials to Pakistan.
While noting the priority areas indicated by the prime minister, the high commissioner also expressed interest in strengthening sports and cultural cooperation, particularly in cricket and hockey.

2,Cop martyred while protecting Peshawar Sikh healer,Attack rings alarm bells across province as community worries about its safety,"A policeman on Tuesday embraced martyrdom while protecting a Sikh healer when unidentified assailants fired gunshots at his clinic located in the suburbs of Peshawar.
Constable Farhad, a 40-year-old ex-serviceman, lost his life when the gunmen opened fire on Guljit Singh’s clinic in Baghbanan area falling within the limits of Inquilab police station. However, the Sikh healer remained unhurt.
Peshawar police chief Syed Ashfaq Anwar said security was provided to the Sikh community.
“The policeman sacrificed his life and the Sikh healer remained safe in the attack,” he added.
The city’s police chief continued that an investigation was under way and it would be premature to say anything about the incident.
The Sikh community has expressed its concern over the attack.
Baba Gurpal Singh, a Sikh leader in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, told The Express Tribune that in the last few years, around a hundred families of their community have migrated from Peshawar because of terrorism, unemployment, and targeted killings.
“A few of them have settled in Punjab families while most of them have shifted to the US, Canada and Europe,” he added.
Gurpal said 18 Sikhs were killed in the last few years and 11 injured in terrorist attacks.
“We can only demand better security measures and a favourable environment from the government.”
K-P Counter Terrorism Department chief Shaukat Abbas had previously claimed that the international terrorist organisation, Daesh, was involved in the killing of the religious minorities in the province i.e. the Sikh and Christian communities and other important targets but its network had been eliminated from Peshawar last year.
Even the “last” terrorist of the network was killed in the year 2023 in Peshawar.
However, the attack on Tuesday has rung alarm bells across the province.
According to K-P CTD’s data, there has been a marked increase in the incidents of terrorism this year.
Only from January to March, there have been 131 terrorist attacks in K-P and its tribal districts
Over 60 of them were on the police, while the southern districts witnessed the highest number of them.
In June last year, unidentified motorcyclists shot dead a Sikh trader, identified as Manmohan Singh, in Peshawar’s Kakshal neighbourhood.
K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur condemned the attack on the policeman assigned to the security of a citizen belonging to the Sikh community in Peshawar.
He expressed his grief over the martyrdom of the constable.
In a statement, the K-P chief minister offered his condolences to the family of the martyred policeman and prayed to the Almighty grant them fortitude to bear this loss.
Gandapur directed the authorities concerned to take necessary measures to improve the security of religious minorities.
He pledged that the elements involved in the attack would be arrested and brought to justice.
The K-P CM assured the family of the martyr that the provincial government would not leave them alone in this hour of need and support them in every possible way.

3,Flip-flops over Nawaz's China trip raise eyebrows,PML-N leaders give contradictory statements after denial,"PML-N founder Nawaz Sharif's sudden trip to China, just before the Iranian president arrives in Pakistan, has thrown his own party for a loop, leaving them in a quandary, with contradictory reasons being given for the visit.
Nawaz, hailed by his party as a seasoned hand capable of solving Pakistan's myriad problems, embarked on what is said to be a five-day trip to China, just a day before the scheduled arrival of the Iranian president in Lahore.
Although the two trips do not appear to conflict, considering Pakistan's political landscape, a meeting between the Iranian president and the former prime minister would not have been deemed unusual.
Nevertheless, the lingering question persists: What was Nawaz Sharif doing in China? At first, the federal minister for information rebuffed reports of the journey, but later, the party attributed it to a scheduled meeting and a medical examination.
PML-N leader Muhammad Mehdi echoed the same explanations, emphasising that any gatherings in China would be at Nawaz Sharif's discretion.
Oddly, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari dismissed both the medical checkup and meeting explanations, asserting that Nawaz Sharif had travelled to China to attend an exhibition.
She explained that the former PM has a penchant for exhibitions and questioned why he shouldn't attend one now that he has spare time. Bukhari expressed bewilderment at the media's speculation regarding his private trip, particularly given his lack of official responsibilities.
When questioned about Nawaz Sharif's absence for a potential meeting with the Iranian president, Azma Bukhari attributed it to the latter not scheduling a meeting with him. She further stated that Nawaz Sharif was not at everyone's beck and call; any desire for a meeting would have to be conveyed through intermediaries.
Concerning the abrupt change in secretary information and DG DGPR on the day of such a crucial trip, Azma Bukhari clarified that every government possesses the prerogative to appoint officers based on merit.
She clarified that the decision was made a day prior and was only officially announced on Tuesday.

4,"Challenges marred by-elections, says FAFEN","Report highlights voter turnout, restrictions on independent observation and procedural concerns"," 
The recently held by-elections in 22 national and provincial assembly constituencies, especially in Punjab, presented a mixed bag of outcomes as concerns loomed large over low voter turnout among other issues, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said in its report on Tuesday.
While advancements in results management and decreased ballot exclusion are noted, procedural lapses and restrictions on independent observation in two provincial constituencies remained a concern.
The body noted that low voter turnout, procedural irregularities and restrictions on independent observation in two provincial constituencies in Punjab overshadowed the improved results management and lower numbers of ballots excluded from the count.
Polling station establishment, voter identification, and counting at polling stations were observed to have been largely compliant with law and procedures. However, instances of omissions in ballot issuance requirements by assistant presiding officers (APOs) were reported from around 14 per cent of the observed polling stations.
While polling agents and accredited observers generally had access to voting and counting process, security officials or presiding officers barred FAFEN observers from observing the election process at 19 polling stations in PP-36 Wazirabad and PP-22 Chakwal-cum-Talagang.
In PP-22, the accreditation process of FAFEN observers was also delayed until the midday on the polling day causing last-minute changes in the observation scope.
Nearly 36 per cent of registered voters cast their votes on polling day – nine per cent less than the turnout in 18 of these constituencies on February 8, 2024.
Votes polled by women decreased by 12 percent, while votes polled by men declined by nine percent, despite an increase of 75,640 registered voters, including 37,684 men and 37,956 women compared to the general elections.
Lahore’s five constituencies recorded the sharpest decline in the voter turnout with PP-147 reporting a mere 14 percent as against 35 percent on February 8.
Similarly, NA-119 Lahore registered a 19 percent turnout against 39 per cent on February 8. However, the voter turnout in Gujrat and Khuzdar constituencies recorded an increase compared to general elections.
The declining turnout was accompanied by a reduction in the number of ballots excluded from the count during the by-elections, almost halved (35,574) as compared to the number of invalid ballots (72,472) during the general elections. In addition, there were no constituencies where the rejected ballots exceeded the margin of victory as against four in the general election.
ECP issued provisional results for all the constituencies by the legal deadline of 10 am. on the following day of the poll day despite suspension of cellular data services in the constituencies in Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh. However, K-P constituencies did not report any such disruption, the Fafen noted.
The parties that won during the general elections retained their seats in the by-elections, except in PP-36 Wazirabad and PP-93 Bhakkar. In these constituencies, PTI-backed candidate and an independent candidate had won during the general elections, but PML-N candidates emerged successful in the by-elections.
These two were among the four constituencies where the margin of victory has decreased as compared to the general elections unlike the rest where the margin of victory has increased.
The by-elections were necessitated due to the death of candidates in four constituencies and vacation of seats by wining candidates in 19. PB-50 Killa Abdullah, however, went to the re-poll after a Supreme Court verdict. Of these 24, ECP notified uncontested returned candidates in NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad-I and PS-80 Dadu-I.
A PTI-backed independent candidate for NA-207 moved the Sindh High Court (SHC) praying nullification of the uncontested elections claiming that his nomination was wrongly rejected by the returning officer.
According to the Lists of contesting candidates (Form-33), a total of 264 candidates including 256 men and eight women contested for the 22 constituencies. Of these 264, 88 candidates represented 21 political parties, while the remaining 176 contested independently.
The ECP had set up 4,238 polling stations – 935 male, 899 female and 2,404 combined – comprising 13,811 polling booths – 6,778 male and 7,033 female – to cater to more than 6.3 million registered voters.

5,"Country's economy on the right track, says finance minister",Stresses necessity of taxation for the nation's economic progress as there's simply no way around it,"Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on the floor of the National Assembly on Tuesday that the country’s economy was going in the right direction but people will have to pay taxes as there was no other way around to move ahead.
In the same breath, the financial czar also told the house that traditional banking was moving towards Islamic banking in line with a decision of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC), calling to implement the Riba-free banking system in Pakistan.
While referring to the FSC decision, the finance minister said that the court order as well as its implementation timeframe has already come, saying several bank branches converted from conventional to Islamic banking last year.
Following the FSC decision ordering Riba-free banking, the government had announced in 2022 that it would implement the FSC decision, saying that it would transform the existing interest-based banking system to an interest-free model in the next five years.
FM Aurangzeb said that things were being moved under a certain timeframe, including required legislation, saying this was about the domestic economy and the court decision’s implementation timeframe was five years.
“Under the State Bank [of Pakistan] and Ministry of Finance auspices, we are moving in that direction,” Aurangzeb told the assembly.
His response had come after members from treasury and opposition benches made fiery speeches, calling to end interest banking. He then wondered why the speeches were made by MQM-P’s Mustafa Kamal and PTI-SIC’s Ali Muhammad Khan when things were already in process, reminding the house that apart from the domestic economy, Pakistan is also connected to a global economy.
Aurangzeb then shifted to the economy and shared with the National Assembly that the fiscal position was far better than the previous year. He said that the current account deficit was in surplus and the foreign exchange reserves had reached $8 billion despite a payment to Euro bond.
He, however, added that the payment was made while relying on the interest-based system as the country was connected to the global economy, saying “We can’t do anything about it”.
He told the house that the fiscal year will end with $9 to $10 billion reserves by the end of this financial year as the next tranche of $1.1 billion will come by the end of the week. “This is equivalent to two months of import cover,” he said.
During his speech, Aurangzeb said that the country needed to go for structural reforms, increase its tax net and privatise the loss-making state-owned entities, adding that this could stabilise the economy, help Pakistan to exit IMF programs and attract foreign direct investment.
Meanwhile, the assembly passed a resolution calling for ensuring payment of minimum wages moved by PPP’s Agha Rafiullah. The resolution stated: “This House is of the opinion that the Government should take immediate steps to ensure the payment of the minimum wages announced by the Government in the Government-run departments as well as in the private enterprises.”
Although the resolution was passed, the finance minister responded that the federal government could only ensure the implementation of minimum wages to the extent of Islamabad, saying the provinces should also be asked to ensure its implementation. The minimum wage is Rs32,000 per month and, mostly the security guards, are deprived of it.
Rafiullah had even asked the speaker to enquire how much was being paid to people working at the cafeteria of the National Assembly, saying it would make it clear how the lower staff was being treated in NA and the capital.
In addition, PPP’s Dr Nafisa Shah’s bill seeking to end discrimination among the citizens by amending Article 25 of the Constitution was sent to the committee concerned. In addition, Shah’s bill proposing to give citizens a right to submit a public petition in matters of personal or collective nature to the National Assembly was also sent to the committee concerned.
Shah is seeking amendments in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007, stating that new Rules 295 and 296 shall be inserted to allow citizens to approach NA with public petitions.
The PPP lawmaker has proposed that under Rule 295 (1) (right of petition), “any citizen of Pakistan or any natural or legal person residing or having a registered office in the country shall have the right to address, individually or in association with other citizens or persons, a petition to the National Assembly on a matter which affects him, her or them directly.”
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar and JUI-F’s Shahida Akhtar opposed the bill on the grounds that it would be equal to establishing a parallel system without having proper resources and expertise. The bill, however, was referred to a committee.
Meanwhile, PTI-SIC member Zartaj Gul raised the matter of Indian water aggression against Pakistan by developing the Shahpur Kandi Barrage on the Ravi River to stop water flow to Pakistan. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, admitted before the house that India has the right to the River Ravi water under a treaty and Pakistan can’t go for agitation.
To Gul’s fiery outburst as to why the law minister has admitted India’s right, Tarar replied that one should speak as per legal position and no one should do politics on such matters.

6,ECP served notice on K-P CM’s ‘polls rigging’ pleas,PHC also disposes of Gandapur’s writ plea after JUI-F leader withdraws application,"The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking its response on the petitions filed by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur against the action taken by the electoral body on the allegations that the February 8 general elections were rigged.
The court also disposed of a writ petition of the K-P CM in a case of alleged rigging in the elections after the JUI-F withdrew its application from the ECP.
A two-judge bench of the PHC comprising its Chief Justice Syed Muhammad Atiq Shah and Justice Khurshid Iqbal heard the petitions filed by Gandapur.
The bench extended the stay order on the ECP taking action against the K-P chief minister.
Besides, it also extended the stay filed against stopping the recount of votes in the constituency of NA-43 Tank.
The K-P CM’s lawyer, Alam Khan Adenzai, informed the court that the ECP had issued a notice to his client on the complaint of his political rivals.
He pointed out that JUI-F’s Kafeel Nizami, who had filed an application against his client, had withdrawn his plea.
He continued that the ECP had not responded to the application filed by Gandapur’s opposing candidates, Ziaullah and Muhammad Junaid.
The court sought a response from the ECP on the applications filed by Ziaullah and Junaid. It also disposed of the case of the JUI-F leader as he had withdrawn his application from the ECP.
Similarly, the bench also extended the injunction on the writ filed against NA-43 Tank vote recount.
Adenzai, who was also representing MNA Dawar Kundi, told the court that 40 polling stations in the constituency had been recounted at the request of JUI’Fs Asad Mahmood and eight on the plea of his client.
However, he continued that Mahmood illegally and unconstitutionally sought recount at 300 polling stations.
The lawyer argued that the ECP no longer had the authority to conduct a recount. The bench stopped the recount by extending the injunction and issued a notice to the ECP seeking its response.
Separately, the two judge bench of the PHC comprising Justices Ijaz Anwar and Shahid Khan asked the K-P advocate general to submit his response by May 2 on a writ filed against the provincial government approving one month’s budget without the approval of the assembly.
PA opposition leader Dr Ibadullah Khan’s lawyer, Aminur Rehman Yousafzai, told the court that the K-P caretaker government had presented a budget for four months under Article 126 of the Constitution.
He continued that the present elected provincial government presented the necessary expenditure budget for the month of March under Article 125 of the Constitution.
He reminded the PHC that in March, it had ordered the K-P speaker to swear in the MPAs on reserved seats at its next session.
However, he continued that to avert the swearing-in of those lawmakers, the provincial government did not call the budget session.
The lawyer told the court that the K-P government presented the budget for the month of April under Article 126 similar to what the caretaker government had done.
In another case, a contempt petition was filed in the PHC as despite its orders, 35 personnel working in the police department -- from grade-16 to grade-17 – had not been promoted with the IGP and additional IG named as parties in the plea.
It was filed by Muhammad Hamid and 34 other workers who had not been promoted against the court’s orders.
In the contempt plea filed through their lawyer, Advocate Saadullah Marwat, the employees pointed out that the PHC, in its order on February 6 this year, had declared that the case of the petitioners, who were working as assistants in grade-16, should be placed before a departmental committee for their promotion to grade-17.
However, they pointed out that despite the passage of two months, neither had they been promoted, nor their case presented before the committee.

She was sharing her views as chief guest in a seminar on the “Role of Muslim Women in the Emerging Muslim Civilisation”, organised at the IBA City Campus here.
The event was hosted by the Faculty of Islamic Studies University of Karachi and the Culture Center of Iran Karachi.

8,SC says wife to benefit if Nikahnama terms unclear,Judgment says any ambiguity cannot be used against wife when terms decided by men,"The Supreme Court has ruled that in case of any ambiguity in the terms and conditions agreed at the time of wedding and written in the Nikahnama, the benefits would be given to wife, stressing that if someone else had filled the Nikahnama form, it cannot be used against the interest of the bride.
A two-member bench consisting of Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Athar Minullah issued on Tuesday a detailed 10-page judgment on an appeal relating to a couple’s divorce. The judgment was authored by Justice Athar Minullah.
According to the facts of the case, after the divorce, the woman approached the court for the return of dowry and other items under the conditions stipulated in the Nikahnama. When the matter reached the high court, the woman was given a plot mentioned in column number 17 of the Nikahnama.
Against the high court ruling, the appellant moved the Supreme Court, taking the stand that the purpose of the plot was that a house would be constructed there and as long as the marriage lasted the woman could live there. However, there was no such explanation written in the Nikahnama.
The legal question before the Supreme Court in the case was: if there was any ambiguity in the terms and conditions in the Nikahnama how it could be resolved. The court said that it was a settled law that any ambiguity in a contract was determined by the intention of the parties.
However, in this case, the judgment noted, before interpreting the terms and conditions of the Nikahnama, it should also be considered whether the bride had full freedom to give her consent to the terms and conditions of the marriage.
The judgment noted that in a male-dominated society, the terms and conditions were generally decided by the men on behalf of the bride. So, it added, If someone else filled the columns of the Nikahnama without meaningful consultation of the bride, it could not be used against the interest of the bride.
If there was ambiguity or doubt in the terms and conditions of the Nikahnama or in any entry or column, then the wife would get the benefit, according to the judgment. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the high court and dismissed the appeal.

9,SC petition calls for NAP enforcement,Govt along with other relevant parties named as respondents,"A petition seeking the implementation of the National Action Plan was lodged in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, with the federal and provincial governments, along with the interior ministry, and other relevant parties, named as respondents.
Nawabzada Jamal Raisani, Patron-in-Chief of Balochistan Martyrs Forum filed the petition through Advocate Hafiz Ehsan Khokhar and urged immediate implementation of police reforms and measures to combat terrorism.
The petition specifically calls for the immediate initiation of police reforms. It also sought prompt decisions on all pending terrorism cases across various courts.
Additionally, Raisani in his petition implored the federal and provincial authorities to adopt measures in line with international standards to ensure the protection of witnesses and prosecution.
The petition advocates for the provision of free education to the children of martyrs - and security for their families. It also emphasized the necessity of preventive measures to curb the propagation of terrorism via social media platforms.
Raisani pleaded for legal action against individuals who falsely label terrorists as missing persons for propagandist purposes.
Such actions, he argued, not only distort the reality but also undermine efforts to combat terrorism effectively.
