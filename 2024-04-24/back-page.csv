0,Arrests at major US varsities as Gaza protests spread,Columbia cancels in-person classes amid crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators,"NEW YORK: Police arrested more than 130 pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Yale University (YU) in Connecticut and New York University (NYU) in Manhattan, as the Israel assault on Gaza continued to reverberate through university campuses in different parts of the United States.
Police crackdowns came after Columbia University cancelled in-person classes on Monday in response to protesters setting up tent encampments at its New York City campus last week.
Some of America’s most prestigious universities have been rocked by protests in recent weeks. 
The demonstrations come amid sweeping debates over Israel’s assault on Gaza. Such bastions of higher education — Harvard, Yale, Columbia and others — are grappling for a balance between students demanding free speech rights and others who argue that campuses are encouraging intimidation and hate speech.
On Tuesday, the New York Police Department claimed that 133 people had been arrested at NYU and released after being issued with court summons, as protests also intensify at Yale, Columbia University and other campuses.

Columbia cancels in-person classes amid crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators 

Demonstrators earlier blocked traffic around Yale’s campus in New Haven, Connecticut, demanding the school divest from military weapons manufacturers. Police arrested more than 45 protesters, according to the student-run Yale Daily News.
In New York, officers moved on the NYU crowd shortly after nightfall as hundreds of demonstrators for hours had defied university warnings that they faced consequences if they failed to vacate a plaza where they had gathered. 
Video on social media showed police taking down tents in the protesters’ encampment.
As demonstrators tussled with officers and chanted, “We will not stop, we will not rest. Disclose. Divest.” 
In an email to Columbia staff and students on Monday, Columbia President Nemat Minouche Shafik said the university was cancelling in-person classes and moving to online teaching to “deescalate the rancour and give us all a chance to consider next steps.” 
Last week, Shafik called in NYPD to clear a tent encampment protesters had set up on Columbia’s main lawn to demand the school divest from Israel-related investments, an unusual move condemned by some faculty.

The school said the encampment violated rules. Police arrested more than 100 students from Columbia on charges of trespassing. Columbia and the affiliated Barnard College suspended dozens of students involved in the protests against Israel.
“These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas,” said Shafik, who recently testified before a US House of Representatives committee, defending the school’s response to protests.
Republicans in the House and the Senate, as well as at least one Democratic senator, demanded Shafik resign.
Anti-Semitic debate
Earlier on Sunday, US President Joe Biden, who has been criticised by the protesters for supplying funding and weapons to Israel, in a statement said: “This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country.” 
Also, while expressing concern about the unrest, US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona posted on X, “anti-Semitic hate” on college campuses was unacceptable.
Student organisers from the Columbia encampment criticised the Biden statement, noting that “some of the organisers are Jewish”. 
“It’s very clear to us that people on the outside do not understand what this encampment is about,” said Lea Salim, a Barnard sophomore who said she was one of 15 Jewish students arrested on the Columbia lawn last week. 
Salim said it was not anti-Semitic to criticise the state of Israel. 
Social media images on late Monday night appeared to show pro-Palestinian Jewish students holding traditional meals inside the protest areas on campuses including at Columbia.

1,Russian court rejects fresh appeal by WSJ reporter,"On Tuesday, however, journalists were allowed to film Gershkovich as he stood in a glass box in the courtroom and waved at media colleagues.","MOSCOW: A Russian court on Tuesday rejected the latest in a series of appeals by Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich against his pre-trial detention on charges of espionage.
Gershkovich, 32, bec­ame the first US journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War when he was detained by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on March 29, 2023. He, his newspaper and the US government all deny he is a spy.
No date has yet been set for his trial, though his detention was extended last month to June 30 in a hearing that was closed to the press.
On Tuesday, however, journalists were allowed to film Gershkovich as he stood in a glass box in the courtroom and waved at media colleagues.
The WSJ reported that Gershkovich replied “all clear” when asked by the judge whether he understood the court’s decision.
“It continues to be outrageous that Evan has been wrongfully detained by the Russian government for more than a year,” the newspaper stated, urging the Biden administration to do everything in their power to secure his release.
Gershkovich, who was accredited by the Russian Foreign Ministry to work in Russia as a journalist, was arrested during a trip to the Urals city of Yekaterinburg.
He has been held for over a year at Moscow’s high-security Lefortovo prison. The US has accused Russia of using him for the purpose of “hostage diplomacy”.
“We will continue to denounce and impose costs for Russia’s appalling attem­pts to use Americans as bargaining chips,” Pre­sident Joe Biden said last month on the anniversary of Gershkovich’s arrest.
President Putin has said Gersh­kovich could be released at some point in exchange for a Russian prisoner held abroad.
Gershkovich and Paul Whe­lan, an American convicted of spying against Ru­s­sia and sentenced to 16 years in 2020, have both been designated by the US State Department as “wr­o­n­­­gfully detained”.

2,US report highlights India’s transnational repression,Report claims Pakistani governments ‘tacitly approved enforced disappearances’,"WASHINGTON: An official US report suggests that India engages in “transnational repression against individuals in another country”, seemingly referring to alleged assassinations and assassination attempts carried out by Indian agents in Canada, Pakistan and the United States.
The 2023 Human Rights Report from the US State Department, released this week, also accuses Pakistan of similar actions. It alleges that the Pakistani government intimidates or seeks reprisal against individuals beyond its borders, including civil society activists, human rights defenders, and journalists, as does India.
The report accuses both governments of committing significant human rights violations, including arbitrary and extrajudicial 
killings, torture, inhuman treatment, life-threatening prison conditions, as well as arbitrary arrests and political detentions. Addi­tionally, it states, “a lack of accountability contributes to widespread impunity.”

Report claims Pakistani governments ‘tacitly approved enforced disappearances’

According to the report, the Indian government faced accusations in 2023 from other governments, diaspora communities, and human rights groups of being involved in the killing of individuals or using violence or threats of violence against individuals in other countries as reprisal.
Specifically on Sept 18, 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that his government was investigating allegations of a connection between Indian government agents and the killing of a Sikh Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Nijjar had been designated a terrorist by the Indian government due to his advocacy for the creation of an independent Sikh state called Khalistan. The Indian government denied any involvement.
Threats and coercion 
Civil society organisations, members of diaspora populations, and journalists advocating for human rights outside the country reported experiencing threats, harassment, arbitrary surveillance, and coercion, including online. They attribute these actions to the government or individuals alleged to be connected to the government.
They recounted instances where their families, friends, or associates in India encountered harassment and pressure from local authorities because of their human rights activities. These occurrences instilled a “chilling effect” on their advocacy endeavours, leading to self-censorship out of concern for reprisals against themselves and their families in India.
The report on Pakistan highlighted last year allegations from activists accusing the government of carrying out politically motivated killings and kidnappings in other countries. 
Journalists and civil society members in exile across Europe and elsewhere reportedly faced targeting, harassment, and torture by government agents. In August, the mutilated bodies of exiled Baloch activist Hani Baloch and her husband Sameer Baloch were discovered in a town in Iran.
Disappearances
However, the report primarily emphasised disappearances, noting instances in 2023 where kidnappings and enforced disappearances occurred nationwide. Some officials from intelligence agencies, police, and security forces reportedly held prisoners incommunicado and withheld information about their whereabouts.
The report alleged that successive Pakistani governments tacitly approved enforced disappearances. Citing figures released in August by the government’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disapp­earances, it stated that out of the 9,967 missing-person cases reported to the commission since 2011, 7,714 were resolved, while 2,253 remained pending.
Regarding fair trials, the report noted military trials of civilians accused of rioting on May 9, which occurred following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
There was no official reaction to the report from Pakistan’s Foreign Office until going to press.

3,10 killed as two Malaysian military choppers collide,"One chopper was seen clipping the rear rotor of another, causing both to go into a tailspin and crash.","KUALA LUMPUR: Two Malaysian military helicopters collided and crashed during a training session on Tuesday, killing all 10 crew onboard, the country’s rescue agency said.
Footage shared online showed several helicopters flying low in formation over the Lumut naval base, located about 160km from Kuala Lumpur, while participating in a fly-past rehearsal ahead of Naval Day celebrations in May.
One chopper was seen clipping the rear rotor of another, causing both to go into a tailspin and crash.
“The two helicopters collided during flight training,” said Suhaimy Mohamad Suhail, senior operations commander from the fire and rescue department, adding that all 10 crew members on board were confirmed dead by medical officers.
The two aircraft involved were a Eurocopter AS555SN Fennec and an AgustaWestland AW139, the rescue agency said.
Photos showed the Eurocopter model heavily mangled in the wreckage on the naval base stadium track with rescue personnel surrounding it as well as various debris.
The AgustaWestland helicopter crashed at the naval base’s swimming pool area.
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim sent his condolences to the families of the victims, saying “the nation mourns the heart-wrenching and soul-wrenching tragedy”. 
Malaysia’s King Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar also shared condolences. “Queen Zarith and I feel very sad over the loss of national heroes in this tragedy,” he said in a social media post.

4,List of banned outfits sees first update since 2020,Latest addition Zainebiyoun Brigade is a militant group which was designated by the US State Department as a terrorist organisation in 2019.,"ISLAMABAD: The number of proscribed outfits has swelled to 79 after the first addition in the list of terrorist organisations in four years.  
The latest addition to the list, the Zainebiyoun Brigade (ZB), is a militant group which was designated by the US State Department as a terrorist organisation in 2019. 
The decision to ban Zainebiyoun Brigade was notified after escalation of  tensions with Iran in January and implemented on March 29. 
Seen by observers as a move by Islamabad to appease Washington, while others speculate this was done to win favour with Riyadh, whose foreign minister visited Pakistan recently.  
According to security analyst Mohammad Amir Rana, the Zainebiyoun Brigade is believed to have been involved in supplying weapons to the IRGC in the Middle East. 
Last month, reports emerged of alleged Zainebiyoun members of Pakistani origin being apprehended in international waters for carrying weapons to be given to the IRGC in the Middle East. 
In another incident, the death of a Pakistan-origin commander in Syria affiliated with the group paved the way for Pakistan to ban it. Pakistani law-enforcement agencies are believed to have sufficient proof of the Zainebiyoun Brigade`s involvement in sectarian violence in the country and recruitment for the Iraq and Syria conflict, but the government had not acted earlier because of circumstances linked to the alleged presence of Baloch insurgents on Iranian soil.
The loyalty of its members, who prioritise ideological affiliations over national ties, also remains a major challenge for security institutions.
Formed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after a civil  war broke out in Syria in 2011, the Zainebiyoun Brigade, also known as  Liwa Zainebiyoun, is charged with mobilising Pakistani Shias to fight  forces opposed to Syrian ruler Bashar Al Assad, a close ally of Tehran  and Moscow. 
The Brigade has acknowledged ties with the Quds Force since around the 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan, and its formation was announced in 2014 during the conflict in Syria. It recently pledged its readiness to follow orders from the IRGC.
The process of maintaining a list of proscribed organisations started on Aug 14, 2001, when Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-i-Mohammad Pakistan were outlawed. 
Later, the government banned Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, Tehreek-i-Islami and Tehreek-i-Nifaz Shariat-i-Mohammadi on Jan 14, 2002.

5,"Asia hit hardest by climate, weather disasters in 2023: UN","Melting glaciers threatening the region’s future water security, alerts WMO","GENEVA: Asia was the world’s most disaster-hit region from climate and weather hazards in 2023, the United Nations said on Tuesday, with floods and storms the chief cause of casualties and economic losses.
Global temperatures hit record highs last year, and the UN’s weather and climate agency said Asia was warming at a particularly rapid pace.
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said the impact of heatwaves in Asia was becoming more severe, with melting glaciers threatening the region’s future water security.
The WMO said Asia was warming faster than the global average, with temperatures last year nearly two degrees Celsius above the 1961 to 1990 average.
“The report’s conclusions are sobering,” WMO chief Celeste Saulo said.

Melting glaciers threatening the region’s future water security, alerts WMO

“Many countries in the region experienced their hottest year on record in 2023, along with a barrage of extreme conditions, from droughts and heatwaves to floods and storms. Climate change exacerbated the frequency and severity of such events, profoundly impacting societies, economies, and, most importantly, human lives and the environment that we live in,” she said. 
The State of the Climate in Asia 2023 report highlighted the accelerating rate of key climate change indicators such as surface temperature, glacier retreat and sea level rise, saying they would have serious repercussions for societies, economies and ecosystems in the region.
“Asia remained the world’s most disaster-hit region from weather, climate and water-related hazards in 2023,” the WMO stated.
Heat, melting and floods 
The annual mean near-surface temperature over Asia in 2023 was the second highest on record, at 0.91 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, and 1.87 degrees above the 1961-90 average.
Particularly high average temperatures were recorded from western Siberia to central Asia, and from eastern China to Japan, the report said, with Japan having its hottest summer on record.
As for precipitation, it was below normal in the Himalayas and in the Hindu Kush mountain range in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Meanwhile southwest China suffered from a drought, with below-normal precipitation levels in nearly every month of the last year.
The High-Mountain Asia region, centred on the Tibetan Plateau, contains the largest volume of ice outside of the polar regions.
Over the last several decades, most of these glaciers have been retreating, and at an accelerating rate, the WMO said, with 20 out of 22 monitored glaciers in the region showing continued mass loss last year.
The report said 2023 sea-surface temperatures in the northwest Pacific Ocean were the highest on record.
‘Urgency’ for action 
Last year, 79 disasters associated with water-related weather hazards were reported in Asia. Of those, more than 80 per cent were floods and storms, with more than 2,000 deaths and nine million people directly affected.
“Floods were the leading cause of death in reported events in 2023 by a substantial margin,” the WMO said, noting the continuing high level of vulnerability of Asia to natural hazard events.
Hong Kong recorded 158.1 millimetres of rainfall in one hour on Sept 7 — the highest since records began in 1884, as a result of a typhoon.
The WMO said there was an urgent need for national weather services across the region to improve tailored information to officials working on reducing disaster risks.
“It is imperative that our actions and strategies mirror the urgency of these times,” said Saulo. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the evolving climate is not merely an option, but a fundamental necessity.”
