0,"Boat disasters in Africa, Europe leave 43 dead","Boat capsizes off Djibouti leaving 16 dead, bodies of 22 found along Tunisian coast and five drown while trying to reach English shores.","NAIROBI/WIMEREUX: Twenty-one migrants died on Tuesday in boat disasters off the coast of the Horn of Africa and trying to cross  the English Channel from France to Britain. Bodies of 22 people were found off   the coast of the Tunisian port city of Sfax in recent days.
According to the UN’s migration agency, at least 16 people are dead and 28 missing in a new migrant boat disaster off the coast of the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti.
It was the second fatal maritime accident on the perilous so-called Eastern Migration Route from Africa to the Middle East in as many weeks.
Another vessel carrying mainly Ethiopian migrants sank in the same area off the Djibouti coast on April 8, claiming the lives of several dozen people.

Boat capsizes off Djibouti leaving 16 dead, bodies of 22 found along Tunisian coast and five drown while trying to reach English shores

“Tragedy as boat capsizes off Djibouti coast with 77 migrants on board including children,” the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “At least 28 missing. 16 dead,” it said, adding that the local IOM branch was  “supporting local authorities with search and rescue effort”.
Yvonne Ndege, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in Nairobi that the 16 fatalities included children and a baby, without offering further details.
Tunisian coast tragedy
The  bodies of 22 people presumed to be sub-Saharan migrants were found off  the coast of the Tunisian port city of Sfax in recent days, a court  spokesperson said on Tuesday.
“Twenty-two bodies were discovered in  the Sidi Youssef port (off the coast of Sfax) since Saturday,” Hichem  Ben Ayed, spokesman for the Sfax court, said.
“The bodies appear to be sub-Saharan African and were taken to a morgue,” he added. The  spokesman said it remained unclear whether the dead migrants had set  sail from one or more boats, providing no further details.
Tunisia, as well as  neighbouring Libya, have become key departure points for thousands of  migrants, often from other countries, who risk perilous sea journeys in  the hopes of reaching better lives in Europe.
English Channel crossing
Five  migrants, including a seven-year-old girl, died on Tuesday trying to cross  the Channel from France to Britain, local authorities said, just hours  after Britain passed a controversial bill to deport asylum seekers to  Rwanda.
The British government has cast its Rwanda plan, which  cleared a final hurdle in parliament on Monday to international  criticism, as part of measures to deter migrants from making the  perilous sea crossing and avert such tragedies.
The latest tragedy  at sea off the northern French town of Wimereux brings to 15 the number  of migrants who have died so far this year trying to reach English  shores, according to a tally.
That is already more than the  12 migrants killed in the whole of last year while making the crossing  to seek a better future in Britain, according to official figures.

1,Russia detains deputy defence minister over corruption suspicions,Anti-corruption activists have for years criticised what they call widespread corruption in Russia.,"MOSCOW: Russian law enforcement officers have detained Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov on suspicion of taking bribes, Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Tuesday.
President Vladimir Putin was informed of the detention of the high-ranking official, a rare move amid the offensive in Ukraine, Russian state-media reported.
Anti-corruption activists have for years criticised what they call widespread corruption under Putin’s rule.
“Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation Timur Vadimovich Ivanov has been detained on suspicion of committing a crime under Part 6 of Article 290 of the Criminal Code (taking a bribe),” the committee said on Telegram.
The committee did not give any more details.
The offence is punishable by a large fine or over a decade in prison depending on the details of the crime.
Ivanov is already under sanction from the European Union as the defence ministry’s top official in charge of construction of military facilities. He was the subject of an investigation published in 2022 by the banned Anti-Corruption Foundation — created by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
It said the deputy minister oversaw and allegedly profited from the construction projects in Ukraine’s Mariupol, which fell under Moscow’s control after a months-long siege.

2,Musk lashes out at Australian order demanding X remove stabbing videos,Australian prime minister describes Musk as an  “arrogant billionaire” who “thinks he’s above the law”.,"SYDNEY: Elon Musk on Tuesday vowed to challenge Australian demands that his social media platform X take down videos of a recent Sydney church stabbing.
Australia’s Federal Court on Monday gave the platform 24 hours to remove videos of an Assyrian bishop being slashed in the head during a recent attack. Australia’s eSafety Commission had sought the court injunction saying X ignored earlier removal notices.
Musk lashed out at the watchdog on Tuesday, saying the content had already been removed for users in Australia.
“We have already censored the content in question for Australia, pending legal appeal, and it is stored only on servers in the USA.” As the deadline approached, the videos were not available to users in Australia, except for those using a VPN or other location-masking service. Musk claimed Australia was trying to enforce a global ban.
“Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian ‘eSafety Commissar’ is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet,” the billionaire posted on X.
‘Absolutely disgusting’
The matter will return to court this week, where a judge will decide whether to extend the interim injunction. A third hearing will follow where eSafety Commission lawyers will seek a permanent injunction and civil penalties against X, a spokesperson said. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese lashed out at Musk, who he described as an  “arrogant billionaire” who  “thinks he’s above the law”.
“The idea that someone would go to court for the right to put up violent content on a platform shows how out-of-touch Mr Musk is,” Albanese told public broadcaster ABC.
Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie called for Musk to be thrown in prison, saying he had  “no conscience” and his behaviour was  “absolutely disgusting”. “Quite frankly the bloke should be jailed,” she said.
‘Toxicity and hate’
Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was allegedly slashed in the head and chest by a 16-year-old suspect last week, sparking a riot by followers of the Assyrian Christian church in western Sydney.
Video of the bloody attack, which spread widely on social media platforms, has been blamed by Australian authorities for feeding tensions in the community. Many of Sydney’s small Assyrian community fled persecution and war in Iraq and Syria.
Australia has spearheaded efforts to hold the tech giants accountable for what their users post online, under its groundbreaking  “Online Safety Act” passed in 2021.
eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant — a former Twitter employee — has been fighting a series of legal skirmishes with X, attempting to hold the platform accountable for violent and disturbing content. She has raised concerns in the past about a spike in  “toxicity and hate” on the platform following Musk’s takeover.
A spokesperson for the commission said it had also asked other companies, including Google, Snap and TikTok, to remove the footage — which they had done.

3,‘Exceptional’ late snowfall surprises Finland,HELSINKI: Finland on Tuesday experienced exceptionally snowy weather for late April that caused chaos in commuter...,"HELSINKI: Finland on Tuesday experienced exceptionally snowy weather for late April that caused chaos in commuter traffic, halted tramlines and delayed airport departures.
Snowfall in late April or even in May is not unprecedented in the Nordic country.
There is even a Finnish word,  “takatalvi”, to describe instances of sudden cold spells making a return in spring.
However, the last time similar heavy amounts of daily snowfall were recorded in Helsinki on April 23 dates back to 1972 — more than 50 years ago, Ville Siiskonen from the Finnish Meteorological Institute said.
“Having this much snowfall in the south this late in spring is unusual, even exceptional”, he noted.
A wide area of cold precipitation moved over Finland from the east on Monday evening, bringing freezing rain that quickly turned to ice as it hit the cold ground followed by heavy snowfall on Tuesday.
Eight centimetres (three inches) of snow was observed in Helsinki, and in other southern parts of the country the snow cover measured up to 20 centimetres.
“Major disruptions to public transport” were expected in the Finnish capital region the entire day, said the local authority managing public transport system in the Helsinki region, HSL. Due to  “ice on overhead wires following freezing rain”, all tram services in Helsinki city centre were suspended.
Cancellations and delays were expected in rail and bus traffic. Helsinki airport said the  “exceptionally difficult weather” was causing flight delays. “Runway de-icing and aircraft wing de-icing must be carried out much more than usual for the time of year” the airport said.

4,"Hamas to stay in Doha if ‘useful’ for mediation, says Qatar",Qatar continues to reassess its mediation role; says a decision on the presence of Hamas members in Doha will be taken soon.,"DOHA: Qatar said on Tuesday that Hamas’ political leadership would stay in Doha as long as their presence remained beneficial to mediation efforts aimed at ending the war in Gaza.
“As long as their presence here in Doha, as we have always said, is useful and positive in this mediation effort, they will remain here,” foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told a press conference.
Qatar, which has hosted Hamas’ political leadership since 2012 with the blessing of the United States, has been engaged in weeks of behind-the-scenes talks on a possible truce in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
But after mediators, also including the US and Egypt, failed to bring about a pause in fighting during Ramazan, Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani said last week that Qatar was reassessing its role. The announcement prompted speculation that Hamas could be asked to quit the gas-rich Gulf state.
Ansari confirmed Qatar was continuing to reassess its mediation role and that a decision on the presence of Hamas members in Doha  “will not be taken unless we are finished with that reassessment”.
Qatar, which also hosts the region’s largest US military base, has rebuffed frequent criticism of its mediation efforts from Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Ansari said on Tuesday the decision to re-evaluate those efforts was prompted by frustration with political attacks including from  “ministers in Netanyahu’s government, who spoke negatively about the Qatari mediation.” He added:  “They all know what the Qatari role is, its nature, and its details during the previous stage and they lied.”
Qatar successfully brokered the only pause in the Gaza war so far, a week-long truce in November during which scores of Israeli and foreign prisoners were released.

5,Fears grow for Rafah as Gaza crisis rages 200 days on,"Norwegian Refugee Council warns a ground assault on largest displacement camp on Earth would be an ""apocalyptic situation"".","GAZA STRIP: The Israeli aggression entered its 200th day on Tuesday as aid groups warned that Israeli plans to invade the southern city of Rafah where most Gazans have taken refuge would create an  “apocalyptic situation”.
Fears have been rising that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will soon follow through on repeated threats to send troops into Rafah, where 1.5 million people have sought shelter, many in makeshift encampments.
“Everybody seems to be on a countdown to war across the largest displacement camp on Earth, which is Rafah,” Norwegian Refugee Council chief Jan Egeland said.
Egeland warned that a ground assault on Rafah would be an  “apocalyptic situation” and that humanitarian groups  “are completely in the dark on how to mitigate this countdown to a catastrophe”.

Norwegian Refugee Council warns a ground assault on largest displacement camp on Earth would be an ‘apocalyptic situation’

Also on Tuesday, the United Nations rights office said it was  “horrified” at reports of mass graves found at the Gaza Strip’s two biggest hospitals after Israeli sieges and raids.
Israel has repeatedly targeted Gazan medical facilities during the war, accusing Hamas of using them as command centres and to hold hostages abducted on October 7. Hamas denies the accusation.
Gaza’s Civil Defence agency said nearly 340 bodies were uncovered in the past three days of people killed and buried by Israeli forces at the Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
Israel’s army responded by saying that claims it had buried Palestinian bodies were  “baseless and unfounded”, without directly addressing allegations that Israeli troops were behind the killings.
The army said that  “corpses buried by Palestinians” had been examined by Israeli troops searching for hostages and then  “returned to their place”.
UN rights chief Volker Turk called for an  “independent” probe into the deaths at Nasser and Gaza City’s Al-Shifa hospitals, noting the  “special protection” awarded to medical facilities under international law.
Intense shelling
The Israeli army carried out intense shelling overnight of Gaza City, correspondents and witnesses said, with the military saying it also struck Hamas positions in south Gaza.
Shelling and loud explosions were heard in southwest Gaza and Khan Yunis city, while strikes hit the Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps in central Gaza.
Public pressure has mounted on Netanyahu’s government to strike a truce deal that would secure the release of the remaining hostages.
Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas’ armed wing, said that  “after 200 days, the enemy remains trapped in the sands of Gaza” and the prisoners would  “most likely” not return home soon.
At a rally near Netanyahu’s home in the coastal town of Caesarea, protesters including relatives of prisoners set fire to a symbolic Passover table at the start of the week-long Jewish holiday on Monday.
Desperate for foodIn Gaza, the United Nations says  “multiple obstacles” continue to impede delivery of urgently needed aid for Gazans desperate for food, water, shelter and medicine. But Netanyahu has vowed to press on with a planned offensive on Rafah, on the besieged territory’s border with Egypt.
Citing Egyptian officials briefed on the Israeli plans, the Wall Street Journal said Israel was planning to move civilians from Rafah to nearby Khan Yunis over a period of two to three weeks.
Satellite images shared by Maxar Technologies showed tent camps that had recently been set up in that area. The Journal reported that Israel would then send troops into Rafah gradually, targeting areas where Hamas’s leaders are thought to be hiding, in a military operation that would last six weeks.
But humanitarian workers have no knowledge of any evacuation plans, Red Cross official Fabrizio Carboni said.
“There is no condition for a military operation without devastating humanitarian consequences” in Rafah, Carboni said.
Call to renew UN agency funding
The European Union’s humanitarian chief Janez Lenarcic called on international donors to fund the United Nations agency UNRWA, calling it  “the Palestinian refugees’ lifeline”.
His comment came after a much-awaited independent report found that  “Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence” for its claim that UNRWA employs  “terrorists”.
The report did found  “neutrality-related issues”, such as agency staff sharing biased posts on social media.
While some countries have renewed funding for the agency which has been central to humanitarian operations in Gaza, the United States and Britain are among the hold-outs.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington would  “have to see real progress” before it restores funding.
The Gaza war has triggered violence across the region, with deadly cross-border exchanges on Tuesday between the Israeli army and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.

6,Film director aims for ‘different image’  of Gaza,Masharawi is known internationally for being the first Palestinian director to be in the official selection at the Cannes Film Festival.,"ASWAN: Palestinian director Rashid Masharawi wants to  “export a different cinematic image of Gaza”, now ravaged by Israeli aggression, as he presides over the jury at the eighth Aswan International Women Film Festival themed on  “resistance cinema”.
Against the backdrop of the aggression in the Gaza Strip, the festival in southern Egypt decided to screen six Palestinian short films in the competition, which brings together filmmakers from across the region.
This was despite many voices in the Arab world calling for the suspension of all artistic and cultural activities in solidarity with Palestinians.
Masharawi is known internationally for being the first Palestinian director to be in the official selection at the Cannes Film Festival when his film  “Haifa” was included in 1996.
Born in the Gaza Strip to refugees from the port city of Jaffa, the director now lives in Ram­allah in the occupied West Bank. 
“If film festivals do not play their role when major disasters occur, as with what is currently happening in Palestine, then why do they exist?” he asked.
Among the six Palestinian films included at Aswan is the 14-minute documentary film  “Threads of Silk” by director Walaa Saadah, who was killed last month in the war. The film looks at the meanings of the embroidery on the Palestinian  “thawb” robe.
The 16-minute documentary film  “A Cut Off Future” from director Alia Ardoghli discusses the daily experiences of 27 girls between the ages of 11 and 17 in the shadow of the Israeli occupation.
‘Films from Distance Zero’
In his newest film, for which work is ongoing, Masharawi said he wanted to expose what he called  “the lie of self-defence”. 
“The occupation (Israel) blew up the studio of an artist in Gaza with paintings and statues. Where is self-defence when one kills artists and intellectuals while calling them terrorists?” the 62-year-old said.Two months after the beginning of the crisis, Masharawi began a new project: a support fund for cinema in the besieged coastal strip.
The initiative  “Films from Distance Zero” supports Gazan filmmakers living  “under the bombing or becoming refugees” to produce their films.
Female filmmakers are active in the project, about whom Masharawi said,  “always in the most difficult moments, we find the Palestinian woman on the front line.” Around 2.4 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip, which has been under a blockade since Hamas came to power in 2007.
Theatres in Gaza closed at the end of the 1980s during the Palestinian uprising against Israel known as the First Intifada, but reopened after the creation of the Palestinian Authority in the 1990s.
Last year an open-air film festival took place,  “taking into account the customs and traditions of the territory,” a Hamas official said at the time. For Masharawi, now more than ever, it is necessary to support cinema and have  “a different cinematic image of Gaza” reach the world to  “make the truth prevail in the face of the lies of the Israeli occupation”.

7,Maldives vows to send Indian troops home,"“We will bid farewell to the enduring anguish of housing insecurity,"" says President Mohamed Muizzu’s office.","MALE: The Maldives will press on with Chinese-backed construction and evict Indian troops from the strategically placed atoll nation, President Mohamed Muizzu’s office said on Tuesday, two days after his party’s stunning parliamentary victory.
He thanked voters for the landslide victory by his Peoples National Congress, which promised a boom in building apartments, bridges and new airports with Chinese funding.
Muizzu, 45, won September presidential polls after vowing to evict 89 Indian troops deployed in the country.
The Indian contingent, operating three aircraft patrolling the archipelago’s vast maritime boundary, is due to leave by May 10.
Muizzu consolidated his hold on power by winning more than two-thirds of the seats in Sunday’s vote for the 93-member assembly.
“We will bid farewell to the enduring anguish of housing insecurity, a pressing and long-standing concern burdening the Maldivian populace,” his office said, quoting his promise at a victory rally in Male on Monday.
He did not mention China or India by name, but said he will work towards ensuring that the country’s sovereignty is not compromised.
“It is important that Maldivians have sole authority over matters concerning our nation, to be addressed according to our desires,” he said.
Muizzu previously declared that the deployment of Indian troops was an affront to Maldivians, who he said were capable of patrolling their own waters without personnel from the regional powerhouse.

8,Trump accused of wilful violations of gag order,Former president’s attorney draws judge’s ire over reposting of  case-related articles from news sites.,"NEW YORK: Prosecutors on Tuesday accused Donald Trump of brazenly and repeatedly violating a gag order imposed by the judge presiding over his  “hush money” trial to prevent him from intimidating witnesses.
Trump, 77, is charged with falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have impacted his 2016 presidential bid.
Judge Juan Merchan interrupted testimony at the first criminal trial of a former president to hold a hearing to determine whether Trump — who is seeking to recapture the White House in November — should be held in contempt of court for violating his gag order.
Prosecutor Chris Conroy told the judge that Trump’s  “willful” and  “intentional” attacks on witnesses  “clearly violate” the gag order and urged him to fine the real estate tycoon $1,000 for each violation.

Former president’s attorney draws judge’s ire over reposting of  case-related articles from news sites 

“He knows about the order, he knows what he’s not allowed to do, and he does it anyway,” Conroy said. “We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty,” Conroy said, but the court should  “remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary.” 
Jailing Trump could potentially set up a conflict with the Secret Service, the body charged with protecting former and current presidents. Merchan, who warned Trump on April 1 not to publicly attack witnesses, jurors, court staff or their relatives, said he would issue his ruling at a later date.
Trump lashed out following the 90-minute contempt hearing, saying the judge was  “highly conflicted” and  “has taken away my constitutional right to free speech.”  “Everybody is allowed to talk and lie about me, but I am not allowed to defend myself,” Trump complained on his Truth Social platform.  “This is a kangaroo court, and the judge should recuse himself!” 
Election 2024
Prosecution witnesses in the trial are expected to include Daniels and Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen, who arranged the alleged $130,000 hush money payment to the adult film actress.
Trump has repeatedly attacked Cohen and Daniels on Truth Social, calling them, for example,  “two sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly.” Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche told Merchan during the contempt hearing that  “President Trump is being very careful to comply with your honor’s rules.”  “There is no dispute that President Trump is facing a barrage of political attacks from all sides including from the two witnesses who are referenced,” Blanche said.
He drew the ire of the judge after claiming that Trump’s reposting of articles from news sites should not be considered violations of the gag order. “You’re losing all credibility with the court,” the judge told Blanche.
The contempt hearing, held without the presence of the jury, came one day after opening arguments in the sensational trial being held in a Manhattan courtroom.
