KARACHI: Police and allied forces took stringent security measures on Tuesday for the security of the visiting Iranian president and members of his delegation in the metropolis.
A police spokesperson said a total of 3,847 policemen were deployed across the city to ensure peace and order.
However, the closure of many important roads in the city, including Sharea Faisal, Shahrah-i-Quaideen, M.A. Jinnah Road, even before the scheduled time of closure as announced by the traffic police caused inconvenience and hardship to motorists and commuters.
The Club Road from PIDC to Metropole remained completely closed for vehicular traffic.
All government and private educational institutions and offices that fall  under the administrative control of the province government remained  closed due to a public holiday announced by the Karachi commissioner.  However, a large number of people employed with public and private  organisations under the control of the federal government, including  banks, faced hardship in reaching to their workplaces due to heightened  security.
The spokesperson said that 345 officers and employees were stationed in district East, 164 in West and more than 300 in district South. Additionally, 1,500 traffic policemen and over 300 officials of the Special Branch were assigned security duties.
To enhance security measures, snipers were strategically positioned at sensitive locations throughout the city, he added.
Highlighting the commitment of the Karachi police to uphold safety standards, the spokesperson emphasised that every possible measure was being taken to fulfil their duties effectively in safeguarding the visiting delegations.
“The rigorous security arrangements underscore Karachi’s dedication to hosting foreign dignitaries in a safe and secure environment, reflecting the city’s ongoing efforts to bolster best relations with foreign dignitaries,” the spokesperson stated.

8,"SC set to take up Karachi illegal construction, encroachment cases tomorrow","Dismisses plea filed against cancellation of allotment of a 5,000-square-yard amenity plot, asking KDA if it could be made a park.","KARACHI: Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa is scheduled to hear on Thursday (tomorrow) a petition, filed by former Karachi nazim Naimatullah Khan in 2010, seeking apex court’s intervention to get the amenity plots vacated from “land mafia and political parties” in the city, and around 145 other related cases regarding encroachments on public spaces, illegal constructions and conversion of residential properties into commercial ones.
Led by the CJP, a three-judge SC bench comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan will hear the cases at the apex court’s Karachi Registry.
Notices have been issued to the Sindh chief minister, chief secretary and other functionaries of the provincial government, officials of cantonment boards, Karachi Port Trust, Sindh Building Control Authority, local administrations and over 100 other federal and provincial departments/officials as well as the law officers of the federal and provincial governments for April 25.
The apex court had passed several judgements and orders in the petition of the late Naimatullah Khan and other connected matters in the past, but such cases have not been fixed for hearing for over the past two years as the same were lastly heard by then chief justice Gulzar Ahmed, who hung up his robes in February 2022.
The former Karachi nazim had filed the plea in the apex court around 14 years ago, seeking help of the top court to get over 160 amenity plots vacated and, thereafter, hundreds of civil miscellaneous applications (CMAs) have been filed to either become interveners or impleading parties in the main petition.
The matters fixed for hearing on Thursday also include the issue of two private hospitals, located in Clifton, allegedly being run on amenity plots, encroachments on and around various drains of the city, restoration of Kidney Hill Park and cases regarding the Karachi Circular Railway.
The CMAs to be taken up for hearing are also about resettlement and compensation for the affectees of Gujjar, Orangi and Mehmoodabad nullahs, non-provision of water to the residents of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) through pipelines, construction on the premises of Karachi Gymkhana, suspected commercial activities at Askari Park, wedding halls on the premises of the Civil Aviation Authority office near Karachi airport and food street at Burns Road as well as cases about encroachments on amenity plots and illegal and unauthorised constructions in various parts of the city.
Plea against cancellation of land dismissed
The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed an application filed against cancellation of allotment of a 5,000-square-yard amenity plot in the city and directed the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) to file report whether the subject land could be converted into a park.
The Kanpur Old Boys Association had filed an application in 2015 against an order of the Sindh High Court regarding a dispute about the 5,000-square-yard plot located in Block-1, Scheme-36, Karachi.
The association had approached the apex court against a decision of the SHC which had accepted the local administration’s petition about the cancelation of the subject land.
The lawyer for the appellants submitted that the ombudsman had ordered the authorities to issue challan for the allotment of the subject plot and the then city district government filed an appeal against the order of the ombudsman before the Sindh governor, who had also rejected the same, while the SHC had allowed the appeal of the city government, assailing the orders of the ombudsman and governor.
A three-judge bench of the apex court, headed by CJP Isa, questioned the jurisdiction of the ombudsman for hearing and deciding such matters and observed that the counsel for applicants also could not be able to produce the relevant record in the court.
Dismissing the application, the bench asked the KDA director general (DG) whether a park could be established on the subject land. The DG replied that he had to check the status of the land in question first.
The chief justice observed that amenity land could not be used for any purpose other than public services and deplored that the KDA DG was unaware about the status of the land and had no idea about utilisation of such plot. He directed the DG to file a report about the status of the subject plot.

9,Issue of prolonged loadshedding in Karachi areas echoes in NA,"KE resorts to 10 hours of loadshedding in Karachi, says Awais Leghari; Nabil Gabol accuses KE of overbilling.","• KE resorts to 10 hours of loadshedding in Karachi, says Awais Leghari
• Minister believes power theft can’t be resolved without help of provincial govts, law enforcers
• PPP MNA Nabil Gabol accuses KE of overbilling                  
ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari on Tuesday admitted on the floor of the National Assembly that the K-Electric (KE) had resorted to loadshedding for an average duration of 10 hours a day in different localities of the metropolis to recover losses due to power theft and that the federal government had planned to engage provincial governments to improve the situation.  
“This is an economic loadshedding to recover losses,” said the power minister while responding to a calling attention notice moved by Pakistan Peoples’ Party MNAs from Karachi regarding “unscheduled load-shedding and overbilling” in Karachi, especially in Lyari and Azam Basti.  
Mr Leghari said besides 10-hour daily loadshedding, the people of these two localities had to face power outages even for a longer time keeping in view the power theft and losses.  
The minister, however, said out of 2,109 feeders in Karachi, 1,500 were facing no loadshedding, while others were subjected to loadshedding according to their loss rates, which meant that there had been no loadshedding on 71 per cent of feeders in Karachi.  
Mr Leghari said that he was planning to visit Karachi sometime in the next week to have a meeting with Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, declaring that the power theft issue could not be resolved without the support of the provincial governments and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs).  
He also revealed plans to establish a new board aimed at enhancing governance in the sector. The minister mentioned that in Azam Basti, three feeders served 12,200 people, leading to 10-hour loadshedding due to losses.  
Efforts were underway to reduce the current loss rate of 38.3 per cent, he added.  
Regarding Lyari, the minister detailed that out of 82 feeders, there was no loadshedding on 31, while others were experiencing varying durations of loadshedding based on losses.  
Moreover, the minister mentioned ‘proactive’ measures taken by the Sindh government, including setting up over 3,000 mini-camps in collaboration with the KE, to encourage bill payment and cooperation in minimising losses.  
The minister said that the people had ‘no habit’ of paying electricity bills and sought the help of elected representatives of Karachi in this regard.  
He said that during his visit to Karachi, he would meet the officials of the KE and asked the Karachi MNAs to accompany him to KE offices.  
One of the movers, Nabil Gabol alleged that the minister had been provided wrong information by the KE, claiming that there had been loadshedding for up to 18 hours in whole Lyari.  
Due to lengthy power outages, he said, the people were also facing water shortages in Lyari.  
Mr Gabol accused the KE of overbilling the consumers and questioned hefty salary packages of the KE officials.  
“The KE itself is the biggest thief. Its directors are receiving salaries up to Rs4.2 billion. No one is there to question them. Privatisation doesn’t mean that they [KE people] are above the law,” he said.  
The minister said that it was the responsibility of Nepra to ensure post-privatisation quality and that he would ask the regulatory body to ensure it.  
MNA Asad Alam Niazi was of the view that those paying the bills regularly should not be penalised for the fault of others and that depriving law-abiding citizens of this facility was a violation of their fundamental rights.  
Mr Leghari acknowledged that it was a human rights issue, but said that they did not have any mechanism or technology in place to disconnect power supply to individuals without the assistance of the LEAs.  
He disclosed that the KE had installed some mechanical devices on transformers to monitor the situation, but the area residents intentionally damaged those devices, thus forcing the KE to switch off the feeders, instead of disconnecting transformers.  
In response to a question asked by Mirza Ikhtiar Baig about anti-theft measures so far taken by the government, the minister said that the previous caretaker government had launched a drive in this regard which produced good results in some places whereas it failed in others.  
He said his ministry was taking action against those officials of the power companies who were found involved in the power theft.

While in another application, his sister Faryal Talpur sought exemption from the court appearance for one day.
On Monday, advocate Muhammad Waqas, an associate of senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik, filed two applications before the court on behalf of their clients, pleading that Mr Zardari was elected president last month. He submitted that Article 248 (2) of the Constitution safeguarded the president from legal proceedings in court during his term of office.
The said article clause (2) of the Constitution reads: “No criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office.”
“In the light [of] Article 248 (2) of the Constitution of Pakistan… no criminal proceedings can continue against him [Mr Zardari], hence, this instant application is for stay of proceedings against the applicant during his tenure as president of Pakistan,” the application stated.
Meanwhile, another application submitted on behalf of Faryal Talpur, in which the counsel sought exemption for one day as Ms Talpur was engaged in the ongoing National Assembly session.
The court granted the exemption from appearance to Ms Talpur and adjourned the hearing until May 29.
Mr Zardari, Ms Talpur and others have been facing cases pertaining to the alleged opening of fake bank accounts and using them for illicit transactions amounting to billions of rupees.
In 2018, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed by the Supreme Court had identified at least 29 bank accounts as fake and claimed in its report that those had been used for laundering Rs42 billion.
The apex court had in Jan 2019, referred the JIT report and evidence collected to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for further investigation. However, later the cases were transferred to the banking court in Karachi for further proceedings.

12,IO seeks arrest of former Clifton SP  in custodial death case,CCTV footage from Darkhshan police station played before judge,"KARACHI: An investigation officer (IO) on Tuesday informed a judicial magistrate about the need to arrest former SP of Clifton Nayyar ul Haq as he was seen in CCTV footage of the Dharkhshan police station following the arrest and death of Moiz Naseem, a suspect who had died in police custody.  
Meanwhile, the IO also brought Sub-Inspector Sanaullah — who had apprehended Junaid, a son of the deceased in an extortion case — along with other held suspects, Darkhshan SHO Ali Raza Leghari and head moharrir Faisal Leghari, before Judicial Magistrate Mazhar Ali, seeking an extension in their custody for further questioning.  
After the proceeding held inside the judge’s chamber, the IO told Dawn that he had submitted the digital video recorder (DVR) in court of the Darkhshan police station, and the footage was played before the judge.  
In the footage obtained from the Dharkhshan police station, IO told that it could be seen that first, the suspect Junaid, and then subsequently his father, were brought into the police station with blindfolds over their eyes. A few moments later, former SP of Clifton arrived at the station. The IO further explained that there was no footage available while the suspects were allegedly taken out of the station.  

CCTV footage from Darkhshan police station played before judge  

The IO requested the court to extend the physical custody of the suspects as he needed to check the criminal record and photo forensic analyses, adding that it was necessary to arrest former SP Clifton and other unknown suspects.  
Upon IO’s request, the court extended two-day police remand and directed the IO to produce the suspects on April 25 along with case diaries and progress report.  
Barrister Zainul Abideen, representing the legal heirs of the deceased, told Dawn that during the hearing, he had highlighted before the court that the former SP visited Naseem’s house multiple times on the nights of April 14 and 15.  
However, the barrister also claimed that the former SP took along with him the DVR of the CCTV camera installed at the neighbour’s house, adding that the IO admitted in the court that although he had contacted the neighbours for their statements, they refused to testify due to fear.  
Barrister Zain said that the court had directed the IO to incorporate the neighbour’s statements in the record.  
On the other hand, the counsel for the SHO, Advocate Zakir Hussain Bughio, told Dawn that he apprised the court that on April 14 the duty officer and head moharrir of the station were on duty near Seaview.  
Earlier, Additional District and Sessions Judge Ihsan Ali Malik (South) had granted post-arrest bail to Junaid, 19, a son of the deceased Naseem, against a surety bond of the sum of Rs50,000.  
In its order, the court highlighted that the sections included in the FIR were non-congnizable in nature, however, the accused was arrested without taking permission from the magistrate.  
During the proceedings, complainant Abdul Basit of an extortion case did not appear before the court, while the state prosecutor opposed the bail plea.  
On the other hand, Barrister Zain contended that due to the complainant’s ‘influential family’ background, the police had implicated his client, Junaid, and deceased Naseem in a ‘bogus’ case.  
He further contended that on April 14, the applicant, Junaid, was apprehended with his friend near DHA phase 8 without an arrest warrant, and on the same day, his father was allegedly picked up from his residence.   
However, the police did not present him before the judicial magistrate the following day.  
Instead, the investigation officer informed the court of the need to arrest Naseem for an alleged offence, the counsel argued.

According to him, there is also a project for establishing a network of health community centres that would be interconnected with smart mobile health vans to cover rural and urban slum areas, mainly in Punjab and other provinces.
“The first pilot project of NRP in Pakistan is in the health sector because there is a growing demand for healthcare givers globally. According to the World Health Organisation), there would be a demand for 15.2 million healthcare providers in the next 15 years across the world,” Mr Jarral said.
The speakers were of the opinion that Pakistan had no dearth of talented youth and the initiatives would create job opportunities for them in the local and international markets.
The speakers included Dr Maqsood Ahmed, the chief executive officer of Drug Rehab North Carolina, US, Dr Nadeem Rizvi, the US chair World Medical City Karachi Initiative, Pakistan and Mohammad Saleem, the chief executive officer of Fitwell Health, UK.

16,Consultants recommend fundamental changes in modernisation project for Akram Wah canal,HYDERABAD: The consultant firms — Nespak and ACE — working for the implementation of the modernisation plan for...,"HYDERABAD: The consultant firms — Nespak and ACE — working for the implementation of the modernisation plan for Akram Wah (a major canal), have advised some fundamental changes in the project. Differing with previous consultants’ expert opinion, they have recommended lining of the canal, instead of retaining its wall.
The consultants have submitted their review report on feasibility study of Akram Wah with the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (Sida), which has administrative control of the canal. The feasibility report of the project was first prepared by different consultants under the Water Sector Improvement Project (WSIP). The review report is now being discussed by Sida, irrigation department and World Bank.
One such discussion was held recently at a meeting chaired by Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro. It was attended by WB team’s technical delegation. A full mission of WB is due in Sindh in April’s last week and it would also discuss the review report with the stakeholders.
The previous consultants had suggested retaining construction of the canal’s wall till RD-36 and earthen channel post-RD-36 length. 
A major irrigation channel
Akram Wah is perhaps the only channel in Sindh, a considerable length of which was lined in 50s. It emanates from the left side of Kotri Barrage. The channel supplies water to lower Sindh districts of Tando Mohammad Khan, Badin and parts of Hyderabad rural area with a cultivable command area of 0.49m acres and gross command area of 0.59m acres. A considerable stretch passes through Hyderabad city as well.
The estimated cost of the canal’s lining project is Rs18.5bn.
The cost factor
“Expenses of Rs8.5bn will be made on retaining wall construction from RD-0 to RD-36. It means almost 40pc of project’s cost will be utilised for raising the retaining wall alone. Besides, another Rs3bn will be needed for building roads in the very RDs (RD-0 to RD-36) as the canal passes through the [Hyderabad] city’s limits and this expenditure will take the total cost to roughly Rs21.5bn,” said Irrigation Secretary Zarif Khero.
Damaged in 1956 floods 
Record shows Akram Wah was operationalised in 1951 and was badly damaged in the 1956 floods. Kotri Barrage had passed 981,000 cusecs. The canal was repaired for Rs0.6m and it started feeding perennial supplies to the Gaja area in 1957. It became operational again around 1958 after construction of Kotri Barrage. The channel was partly lined and partly earthen when it was built.
But it had a chronic issue as it did not achieve its designed discharge of 4,300 cusecs which was increased from 3,714 in 1960 at its head for decades. 
“We are going through the review report and a final decision will be taken after due consultation with Sida, irrigation department and WB officials,” Jam Khan Shoro told Dawn. He said experts were discussing all proposals including those from implementation consultants that retaining wall should be dropped and canal should be lined up to RD-190, where Matli area of Badin district begins. He said apparently after 70 years, the idea of canal reverting back to earthen structure, at a time when demands of lining of canals in Sindh’s irrigation network are growing, did not look logical.
The recent consultation was also attended by the Hyderabad mayor because the irrigation minister wanted to apprise him of road cutting issue in the light of previous feasibility study report. Roads would have been cut and rebuilt which would obviously lead to traffic gridlock issues until canal works in the city’s area are completed.
Zarif Khero’s view is that in previous consultants’ proposal cost of road construction and use of special-graded soil behind retaining wall which is around Rs3bn was not included while suggesting construction of retaining wall up to RD-36. This Rs3bn expense would take overall cost from Rs18.5bn to Rs21.5bn but canal would remain unlined. “If new proposal in review report of consultants for lining the canal up to RD-190 is given effect, instead of retaining wall, the cost of Rs21.5bn will be same,” he remarked.
Major change in project design
According to Sida Managing Director Pritam Das, present consultants Nespak and ACE have reviewed the report which carried several options and an alternative proposal. “As per alternative proposal, implementation consultants have suggested a major change in canal’s design – lining the canal till RD-190 instead of building retaining wall from RD-0 to RD-36. Deliberations are under way and the minister is on board as well. We will share our input with WB’s full mission whose visit is scheduled for April’s last week,” he told Dawn while answering a question. As per the previous feasibility report, he said, post-RD-36 remaining length may be lined while present consultants have suggested lining coupled with some precautions that were missed when the canal was first built.
