0,Software makes Braille accessible,Property documents for visually impaired planned,"Sheikh Umer Farooq, a citizen of Karachi, has developed a software that aims to counter the unavailability of braille books for the visually impaired. 
The software especially caters to books on science and technology so the blind community has access to these essential subjects. 
The software, Boltay Huroof, was first exhibited at the Lahore Expo Centre. Boltay Huroof works to facilitate and ensure the provision of Braille books to the blind at a lower cost. 
While it is the right of every Pakistani to be provided with basic education, the visually impaired community of the country is deprived of this basic right. 
Unofficial data shows that the number of blind people in Pakistan is more than two million. However, despite the large numbers. there are no textbooks available in Braille to increase accessibility. Only a few books have been published in Braille but those are too expensive for a common person to buy. In schools for the blind children in Pakistan, only the teacher has a Braille book while children are forced to make notes in Braille after listening to the teacher. To make these notes children use sharp pens which cause injuries to their hands.
According to the British Council, ninety percent of blind people in Pakistan cannot complete their education, which is mainly due to non-availability of Braille books. Due to the lack of accessible education the blind are unable to become economically independent and are often considered a burden on others. 
The books are said to be equally beneficial for both the sighted and the blind as writings are in Braille and regular text to make it possible for everyone to read. In this way, teachers of the blind, parents, and siblings can help blind people read without learning Braille. Talking to The Express Tribune, Sheikh Umer Farooq said that he met a forty-year-old blind man who did not know that a dog has four legs. “That is why we have included pictures of animals in our braille books,” he said. According to Farooq, the Holy Quran and the learners guide for Arabic have also been printed in Braille. “The need to create a Noorani Qaida (learners guide) was felt because most of the blind Hafiz persons did not know the difference between basic Arabic letters,” exclaimed Farooq. 
Farooq said that his company has created necessary documents related to banking, in collaboration with various banks, so that when a blind person goes to open his account, he receives documents in Braille. “Blind people will be aware of the terms and conditions of the bank,” stated Farooq. He said that “blind people have the same rights as sighted people to know what conditions they are signing on which documents.” 
Next on the agenda for the software is to make property documents in Braille. Farooq said that there are up to four special children in each class in schools around the world so that these differently abled children grow up in a normal environment. With readily available Braille books, it will be easy for the government to promote the mission of inclusive education as well, hoped Farooq. He said that “the two million blind people can become useful citizens of the country if special attention is paid to their education— which is the mission of the Boltay Huroof software”. He stressed the importance of making the visually impaired economically independent so they contribute to the progress of the country.

3,‘Protecting and taking women along is independence’,Iranian first lady cautions against knowledge sans morality,"Professor Dr Jamileh-Sadat Alamolhoda, the wife of Iranian President Dr Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi, said on Tuesday that knowledge without morality serves the purpose of the powerful and cruel ones.
Addressing an international seminar, exhibition and launching of her book titled 'The Art of Living Femininely' at the University of Home Economics, she said she was happy to visit the women university, adding that there were women universities in Iran as well.
She underscored the need for giving adequate attention towards women whether it was a women university or a co-educational institute. 
She said, ""The cultures of Iran and Pakistan have some common characteristics."" 
Independence of women was compared with western countries, she said and added, “For us, providing protection and taking women along is independence of women.”
Jamileh Alamolhoda said, ""There are a lot of challenges with regard to upbringing of coming generations and all of us have to play our special role in this regard.""
She said that it was high time to stand up for protecting the values of morality, adding, “Each of us was aggrieved over the killing of humans in Gaza.”
She said that time had come to restore values of morality, adding that teachers were actually technicians of knowledge centre. 
""I have mentioned in the book that if women play their role effectively and efficiently then success could be achieved,"" she said.
She said there were two types of extremes, one restricted women to homes while the other put women in the race of earning equal to men. She said both extremes yield negative results in their own ways.
Dr Jamileh Alamolhoda said, ""In Iran, special attention is given in homes to educate girls about providing comfort and respect, whereas boys are educated to provide protection."" 
She underlined the need for giving importance to the family structure as it played a significant role to develop a good society.

5,Opposition blows hot and cold,Treasury lawmakers question inaccuracies in departmental replies,"Opposition lawmakers staged a boycott of Punjab Assembly after a heated exchange with Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan on Tuesday.
The friction arose as the speaker sought cooperation from the opposition to facilitate smooth house proceedings, prompting objections from the opposition benches.
Initially, opposition lawmakers appeared to support Speaker Muhammad Ahmad Khan's criticism of absent ministers, departmental secretaries and alleged incorrect responses from certain departments. However, tensions escalated when the speaker attempted to restrain opposition interventions during the session, leading to a confrontation.
Opposition Leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar responded to the finance minister's challenge of providing evidence of election rigging, asserting their readiness to present substantial evidence.
Speaker Khan, while offering assistance to the opposition in pursuing legal avenues, faced interruptions from opposition lawmakers, who protested against being dictated to.
As the atmosphere grew tense, Speaker Khan suggested that the opposition could boycott the session if they wished, prompting their departure from the house. However, they were persuaded to return by treasury members after a brief absence.
During the question hour session, the treasury benches faced embarrassment when their own lawmakers questioned ministers over inaccurate replies provided by departments.
Speaker Khan expressed dismay over the submission of incorrect information and appointed a committee to investigate the matter.
A PML-N lawmaker raised concerns about discrepancies in salary payments, highlighting a violation of government wage policies.
Speaker Khan also criticised the absence of the minister for industries, commerce, and investment, adjourning the house briefly and directing the government to ensure the minister's presence.
Despite efforts to resume proceedings, disruptions continued, particularly during replies to questions by Minister Shafay Hussain.
Opposition members proposed amendments to the question-hour format, which were unanimously approved by the house before adjourning the session to reconvene on Wednesday.
