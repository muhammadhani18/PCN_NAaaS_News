0,CDA board enhances floor area ratio for commercial plots,Payment plan enhanced from one to two years; work on Iran Avenue to begin soon,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) board has approved a new policy regarding commercial plots, enhancing the floor area ratio (FAR) and duration of the payment plan for such pieces of land from one to two years.
The board, which met at the CDA headquarters with Chairman Anwarul Haq in the chair on Tuesday approved the said policy besides other decisions. It decided that instead of the full payment, the investors would get possession of the plots after paying only 50pc of the amount, which would allow them to start construction (without rights and registration of 3rd party with the CDA). It was also decided that the CDA would approve the building plan after receiving 25pc payment.
In the case of instant payment, the investors will get a 15pc rebate instead of the existing 10pc while those paying in US dollars will get a 20pc rebate. According to the sources, the new policy has increased the FAR to 1:10 from 1:9 for plots measuring 3,000 to 4,999 square yards.
Similarly, plots measuring 5,000 sq yards and above would have 1:12 FAR instead of existing 1:10. The board also decided that investors would also be allowed to have underground parking in the “right of way of roads” to meet the requirement at their own cost.

Payment plan enhanced from one to two years; work on Iran Avenue to begin soon

Speaking to Dawn, one of the committee members elaborated that the building owners would be allowed to have underground parking on the right of way if they had a minimum of three basements reserved for parking. Since the fourth floor for a parking lot is not feasible the developers will be given the option to meet their parking requirement through an underground parking facility in the right of way. “But first they will need to have three basements for parking,” he said.
The board decided that hotel plots measuring 10,000 sq yards would be allowed 1:8 FAR instead of 1:6, with 10pc of permissible FAR for commercial/business centres (inward oriented). Similarly, they will need to allocate 20 per cent of “room areas for serviced apartments”.
A board member said that the new policy is applicable across Islamabad. If the developers want to enhance the FAR of their existing buildings, they will have to pay the CDA for additional floors. The new rates will be worked out by the finance wing.
The CDA board also decided that the work on the remaining portion of 7.5 km of Iran Avenue (formerly 11th Avenue) should be started as soon as possible.
The board approved a summary of the engineering wing for hiring the services of a consultant for the design work of the said road before floating tenders for construction. The federal cabinet changed the name of the road from 11th Avenue to Iran Avenue.
Its first phase from D-12 (where it links with Margalla Road) to E-11 is already constructed and inaugurated by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday. Its second phase, which is yet to be built, starts from E-11 and would culminate at Karnal Sher Khan Road, formerly I.J.P Road.

1,Complete ban on plastic bags to be enforced from June 5 in Punjab,"This decisive measure aims to eradicate plastic bags and mitigate the risks posed by plastic to human life, wildlife and aquatic ecosystems.","RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) Punjab reiterated its commitment to eliminate plastic bags from the district, announcing a complete ban on the use of all types of shopping bags and polythene bags from June 5.
This decisive measure aims to eradicate plastic bags and mitigate the risks posed by plastic to human life, wildlife and aquatic ecosystems.
This was informed in an awareness session with schoolchildren held on the occasion of Earth Day. The initiative, in collaboration with Murree Brewery, Attock Oil Refinery and the National Cleaner Production Centre aims to promote environmental protection measures.
The function was attended by Deputy Director Environment Protection Agency Maria Safeer, along with assistant directors Anza Niazi, Namra Tariq, Romaisa Babar and Inspector Inamul Haq.
Themed ‘Plastic vs. Earth’, this year’s Earth Day campaign seeks to tackle the pressing issue of plastic pollution. The EPA Rawalpindi team has distributed cloth bags to children and shops across the city to encourage the use of eco-friendly alternatives. Banners advocating against plastic usage adorned prominent locations in the city to raise awareness among the people.
In alignment with the Punjab government regulations, a comprehensive ban has been imposed not only on the sale of plastic bags less than 75 microns but also on various plastic items, including disposables and multi-layer packaging plastic products listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the Punjab Single-Use Plastic Products Regulation 2023. Stringent penalties and imprisonment await violators.
Moreover, all plastic manufacturers, collectors and recyclers throughout the province are mandated to register with the Punjab Environment Protection and Climate Change Department to ensure accountability and regulation.
Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to land, water and air quality, exacerbating environmental degradation. Its adverse effects on human health, including cancer and the ingestion of microplastics present in food, underscore the urgency of addressing this issue.
The deputy director emphasised the individual responsibility to opt for cloth bags over plastic ones and choose steel or other environmentally friendly alternatives for food consumption.

3,"‘Corrupt’ cops compromise Diplomatic Enclave security, face probe",Whistleblower faces ordeal; PRO says policemen mentioned in complaint transferred.,"ISLAMABAD: Some police officials deployed outside the Diplomatic Enclave – a high-security zone in the federal capital where many embassies are located – were found involved in taking bribes from visitors to facilitate their entry inside the area.
Sources said the staff of the security division, including some policemen attached with the senior officials of the same division, were exposed by their colleague who was deployed at one of the entry gates of the enclave.
Constable Zahirul Hassan complained to the IGP about the corrupt practice which had put the safety of the high-security zone at great risk, said sources citing the complaint lodged by the constable. 
After the complaint, the culprits, including an official attached to the SSP Security, started threatening the constable and got him posted out of the division.

Whistleblower faces ordeal; PRO says policemen mentioned in complaint transferred

According to the complainant, he was performing his duty at Gate No. 2 of the Diplomatic Enclave when he discovered that police officials were allowing people to enter the area after taking money. 
As per the complaint, the constable was on duty when passengers of a car exiting the gate approached him and offered Rs3,000 as bribe.
They informed the constable that they had paid Rs3,500 to a man inside the enclave for each visit to the enclave, the sources said citing the complaint. They had offered Rs3,000 to the constable to let them enter the zone the next day because their visit to the Thailand embassy had been unfruitful.
When the constable approached the entry section to inquire about the issue, he was told to let them go since they had permission to enter the enclave, sources said, adding that the same men appeared at Gate No.2 the next day and their names were found on the entry list. 
Subsequently, the constable discovered that their names were allegedly added to the list by the personal assistant of the SSP Security Division.
The complaint said the constable went on a five-day leave and upon his return, he discovered that he had been removed from duty through a “wireless message”. 
He subsequently informed the SSP about the matter who appointed an inspector to probe the issue. The next day he was summoned by the inquiry officer to his office and was threatened with dire consequences, the sources said, adding that the constable was further told that there would be no inquiry over the matter.
‘Two-month ordeal’
Later, the inquiry officer got him deployed at the National Police Club through the OSI (orderly sub-inspector) Security Division, they said, adding that later the OSI called him to the OSI branch and informed him that he was transferred to the Police Lines Headquarters from the Security Division and gave him the order report.
When the constable reached the OSI branch of the headquarters he was informed by the in-charge that he was yet to be transferred and asked him to report to the Security Division. He reported to the OSI branch of the Security Division from where he was sent to the Special Branch. After a few days, he was again asked to report to the Headquarters, only to be told that he was yet to be transferred.
After a two-month ordeal, the constable approached the IGP office last month and an inquiry was ordered, which still needs to be completed.
According to sources, an official can only be transferred to another division under the orders of the division’s head, i.e. the DIG. 
Similarly, the offices of the SP Diplomatic Enclave and SSP Security Division monitor the entry of vehicles to the enclave, they claimed.
The police PRO confirmed the incident. He said the constable was reinstated to the Security Division, adding that those mentioned in the complaint were transferred “and closed to the Police Lines Headquarters for further legal action”. 
He said that the assistant inspector general of police (operations) was conducting an inquiry to fix the responsibility, which is still in progress.
He also confirmed that without the order of the respective DIG, an official cannot be transferred to another division. 
The constable was allegedly transferred to the headquarters through the in-charge of the OSI branch of the Security Division under the orders of the SSP Security Division. 
He also confirmed that the entry list of private vehicles to the Diplomatic Enclave was monitored by the SSP Security and SP Security and compiled by their offices.

Malik Imran Ahmed, Country Head, Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, stated that the attempts for 10-stick packs by the tobacco industry was deeply troubling.
“It will not only undermine the progress made in tobacco control but also directly target children and low-income individuals who are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of tobacco consumption. 
“Many countries in the world have banned single-stick and small-stick packet sales because they’re easier to purchase for children, youth, and low-income groups, and hence the health burden is very high,” he said.
He added that the tobacco industry’s claims of being one of the highest contributors to the economy was blatant lies.

The Alliance Francaise that organised the live concert in collaboration with the French embassy introduced Thibault Cauvin as much more than just a guitarist.
“His concerts are timeless moments of grace and rare poetry, where he magically draws in anyone who lends an ear,” said one of the organisers.
After landing in Karachi and visiting Lahore, Thibault Cauvin was in Islamabad to mesmerise audience with his breathtaking talent and passion for music.

The Islamabad Club auditorium provided a decent setting for this type of performance where the audience witnessed a master at work, and be part of an evening filled with stunning musicianship and captivating melodies.
People were treated to a journey through musical landscapes as Thibault Cauvin showcased his mastery on the classical guitar. 
Drawing inspiration from South America, his initial compositions set the stage for a captivating performance. As the evening progressed, Cauvin mesmerised listeners with pieces influenced by movies he encountered during his travels, each note carrying the essence of his experiences.
One particular composition, inspired by a tale from Turkey, transported the audience to a realm of beauty and complexity inherent in classical guitar. However, it was the grand finale that truly stole the show. Collaborating with flute and tabla players from Lahore, Cauvin delved into a mesmerising exploration of the guitar’s boundless expressive capabilities, paying homage to the rich cultural tapestry of the city.

The first-ever conference organised by the Justice Project of Pakistan (JPP) titled ‘Reimaging Justice: Public Health and Human Rights Centred Drug Policy’ was attended by Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, and EU Ambassador to Pakistan Riina Kionka among others.
In his remarks at the first plenary session on ‘exploring proportionate sentencing for drug-related offences’, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah emphasised the importance of adopting a human-rights-based approach to drug policy, a statement issued by the JPP said.
“The criminalisation of drug use has disproportionately impacted the marginalised communities and perpetuated cycles of poverty and discrimination,” Justice Mansoor said, adding that, “it is imperative to shift towards policies that prioritise rehabilitation”.
The senior puisne judge said there was a need to “revive the probation law and mechanism for persons charged with minor drug use” to put an end to unnecessary jail terms.
“Probation for drug offences has been barred since the 2022 amendment to Pakistan’s drug law,” the judge said.
In response to the concerns raised by the SC judge, the law minister pledged to introduce an “effective probation mechanism for persons charged with drug offences”.
Speaking at the session, Federal Minister Tarar said the federal government would work in harmony and “cooperate with international stakeholders to perform its international duties”.
According to the minister, in consultation with the interior ministry, the law [to remove the death penalty for drug-related offences] that has been amended by the parliament is an excellent decision in the correct direction. The government of Pakistan will work in harmony and cooperate with international stakeholders to perform its international duties, he added.
In her remarks, EU Ambassador to Pakistan Riina Kionka called for a “needs-based approach to addressing the global drug problem”.
The EU envoy insisted that the drug policies must be “health-based and respect human rights”.
Former judge Masood Khan highlighted the need for more “in-depth training” with the justice stakeholders. “We need to stop sentencing for deterrence, and start to sentence for rehabilitation,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Justice Project Pakistan Executive Director Sarah Belal called for reforms in the drug policies and advocated a shift away from “punitive approaches” to “evidence-based strategies” to prioritise the health of individuals and communities.
Dr Rai Mohammad Khan from the Federal Judicial Academy demanded an “immediate restoration of parole and probation for drug offences”, calling them “imperative”.
Former commissioner of the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission Ambika Satkunananthan said sentences in such cases must be “proportionate, respectful of human rights, and given by a judge after a fair trial”.

Through the second tranche, which would also be released soon, the remaining LG institutions would also be accommodated on the same pattern, said AJK minister for local government and rural development (LG&RD) Faisal Mumtaz Rathore at a press talk here on Tuesday.
LG&RD secretary Syed Shahid Mohyiddin Qadri and information and forest secretary Ansar Yaqoob were also present on the occasion.
The local government (LG) elections were held in AJK in 2022 in three phases after a gap of more than three decades. However, the elected councillors had been continually expressing dissatisfaction that neither did they possess fiscal resources nor administrative authority to come up to the expectations of their electorate.
Last year, the government had constituted a committee, headed by Mr Rathore, to find a practicable solution to the issue in keeping with the fiscal position of the state.
Mr Rathore said the committee had unanimously recommended to the government to allocate development funds for the LG institutions following which it was decided to spare Rs819 million from “block provision for new initiatives” – a head in the annual development programme of the LG&RD department – for the purpose.
Under the first tranche, 133 wards of the five municipal corporations of state - Muzaffarabad, Bagh, Rawalakot, Kotli and Mirpur - and 278 union councils (UC) of all 10 district councils would get Rs1 million each grant for development purpose at the discretion of the elected councillor concerned.
The next tranche of Rs408 million would disburse Rs1 million each to 278 union councils, 77 wards of 14 municipal committees and 53 wards of 12 town committees, to be spent at the discretion of the UC chairman and municipal and town committee councillors, respectively, Mr Rathore said.
“This is a big initiative whose credit must be given to the present government,” he said.
The LG&RD minister expressed the hope that the councillors would make best possible utilisation of these funds in accordance with the laid down procedure.
He advised the LG institutions to set a benchmark whereby no scheme worth less than Rs100,000 should be entertained and approved.
“I will also advise the LG institutions not to remain dependent on aid from the government. Instead, they should generate their own resources to meet their needs,” he said.
Responding to a question, Mr Rathore said the government had also prepared a mechanism to put to rest a widely prevailing impression that the LG&RD schemes were meant to accommodate political workers, instead of being executed on the ground.
“Now funds would be disbursed on the basis of ‘work done’ in a visible contrast to the earlier practice of advance withdrawal of funds,” he said, adding a mobile phone application would also help the higher authorities to conduct physical verification of schemes.

It asked the deputy commissioner Rawalpindi to take special consideration of the traders’ suggestions in the master planning of Rawalpindi.
The representatives of traders from Raja Bazaar and adjoining markets held a meeting with senior officials of the divisional administration at the commissioner office. Anjuman-i-Tajiran Rawalpindi President Shahid Ghafoor Paracha, Sheikh Siddique and representatives of shopkeepers from the city and cantonment areas participated in the meeting.
During the meeting, Commissioner Rawalpindi Division Aamir Khattak assured them that suggestions of traders would be included in the master plan. He said shopkeepers and the district administration have to join hands and take steps to provide relief to the general public.
The commissioner welcomed the proposals of shopkeepers to maintain law and order in the city and improve the business environment and directed the deputy commissioner to take special consideration of the businessmen’s suggestions during the master planning of Rawalpindi.
He said the grain market, vegetable and fruit market, bus and truck stands and wholesale market will be shifted out of the city. He said sites should be identified for setting up public washrooms in the main markets.
“Public washrooms should be constructed with the help of Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation if a place is identified in their jurisdiction while in private places it can be constructed through donations,” he said.
Apart from this, he said that to improve the sanitation situation all bazaars should identify their temporary collection points where garbage will be temporarily dumped and later picked by vehicles.
Delay in the approval of commercial maps by some departments was highlighted by the traders on which the commissioner directed the RMC to submit a report incorporating the details of the date of application submission and other necessary information.
