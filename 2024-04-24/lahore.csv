1,Police rankers step up to reclaim reserved posts,"LAHORE: After a gap of a few years, a think tank of serving and retired ranker police officers from Punjab has again...","LAHORE: After a gap of a few years, a think tank of serving and retired ranker police officers from Punjab has again launched a move for the creation of the Provincial Police Service (PPS) to challenge the ‘dominance’ of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSPs) across the province.
The prime objective of the think tank is to reclaim the reserved posts which the officers argue, have been occupied by the PSPs in violation of the rules and regulations.
In the initial phase, the group has planned a baithak (seminar) at a hotel in Lahore on Wednesday (today) under the auspices of Republic Policy Organisation, inviting the police officials and others from all the ranks to attend, shed light on the longstanding issue and submit recommendations in order to ‘reform’ the police in Punjab.  
A retired superintendent of police (SP) Tahir Maqsood Chheena is leading the move while many serving provincial police officers, who have joined the initiative, include SPs Syed Mohammad Abbas, Khalid Mahmood Afzal and Dr Mustansar Atta Bajwa.
The event has been organised two years after some provincial service police officers in 2022 brought a matter to the notice of the then chief secretary that the PSP officers were occupying “illegally” nearly 200 seats reserved for the provincial cadre and the matter was shelved for an indefinite period as no progress was made in this respect so far.  
Through a letter, they had pointed out [at that time] that according to the schedule and the Inter-provincial Coordination Committee minutes of the meeting, only 162 out of 362 sanctioned posts were allocated to the Federal Services of Pakistan strength on a ‘sharing basis’, while the remaining posts were reserved for the provincial service.
“We are going to join heads at a historic occasion to discuss decades-old issue in today’s seminar”, Mr Tahir, who is also president of the organisation, told Dawn here on Tuesday. He said they wanted creation of the PPS on the pattern of the Provincial Management Service (PMS) in Punjab for the rights of provincial police service.
In Pakistan, Mr Tahir said, policing has undergone devolution, especially, in the wake of the 18th amendment to the Constitution.
“However, the federal police service/Police Service of Pakistan still controls policing at the provincial and district levels despite constitutional obligations”, the retired SP said.He said under Article 240 (b) and the PCS Acts, policing falls within the purview of provincial authority, necessitating the development of the provincial police service for effective policing in Punjab. 
Additionally, Mr Tahir said the district police service plays a significant role as policing is always devolved to the most localised tier. 
He went on saying that this system guaranteed that the policing is tailored to each district’s needs and challenges.
“So, creating the provincial police service in line with the provincial management service has become a critical subject for executing an exclusive provincial subject of policing”, the retired SP said.
If created, the PPS shall only be answerable to the province contrary to the PSPs who have nothing to do with the province and represent only the federal government, the SP said.

It may be recalled that during the caretaker Punjab government, the wards and departments of the hospital were shut down in September 2023. The patients were asked to go to other government like the Nawab Sadiq Hospital, Jhangiwali Road, where all specialists and doctors of the BVH were also shifted. 
However, most of the patients avoided going there and fell prey to the private hospitals.  
During a visit to the hospital in February, the caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi opened the OPD although its revamp was still incomplete, with the result that the OPD remained inoperative.  
The incumbent government issued orders to reopen the OPD and released all the required funds.  
Talking to Dawn, BVH Medical Superintendent Dr Aamir Bokhari said all the seven departments, including surgery, medicine and eye, had been reopened, which attracted about 3,000 patients on the first day (Tuesday). 
He said online registration of patients and issuance of medicines had been introduced in the new OPD while the released amount of Rs643m would now be utilised to for speedy completion of renovation work.

12,Growers face plethora of issues in selling wheat at official price,Their unfamiliarity with PITB app is a hurdle in getting gunny bags,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: Wheat growers in the district are finding it hard to sell their wheat crop at the official support price announced by the Punjab government and have serious reservations with regard to the procurement policy and the ‘Bradana App’ meant for supplying them gunny bags.  
According to farmers, despite increasing the wheat cultivation target for the district, the government has drastically cut the procurement target, which will force them to sell their yield in the open market at lower rates.    
They argue that according to Punjab Agriculture Department (PAD), total wheat cultivation in the district was on 685,000 acres last year, while this year wheat had been cultivated on 714,000 acres.
As per the Punjab Food Department (PFD), last year the wheat procurement for the three tehsils of the RYK district – Liaqatpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Sadiqabad – was 140,000 matric tons, while in tehsil Khanpur Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (PASSCO) had been assigned the task of wheat purchase. But, procurement target in the district for this year is only 60,000 matric tons, they point out.  

Their unfamiliarity with PITB app is a hurdle in getting gunny bags

They apprehend that this discrepancy will leave them at the mercy of private buyers and they won’t be getting the official rate for their crop this year.   
Similarly, Punjab government had announced that farmers could apply for empty bags (bardana) from April 13 to April 17, through their android cell phones using the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB’s) ‘Bardana App’. It had said the bags would be released to farmers on April 19, while the procurement will start from April 22.
However, most of the farmers in the district can’t use android mobiles to benefit from the PITB app.  
On Wednesday, many farmers from adjoining areas gathered at District Food  Controller (DFC) office, complaining that the ‘Bardana App’ was “not active”.
They were told by the officials to got to the wheat procurement centres with written applications for gunny bags and relevant land record documents.
A  farmer of Chak 88-P, Pull Sunny, Bashir Ahmed, alleged that neither any  telephone number of DFC office helpline, nor of Lahore PFD  helpline, was responding for filing of complaints.  
Narrating their plight, Jam Mushtaq Ahmed, a farmer of Kuba Lal Pir in Taranda Sawaye Khan area, and another of Chowk Sureli of Mao Mubarak said farmers had been forced to purchase costly inputs, including urea fertilizer at Rs4,800 per bag, while the government control rate was Rs3,600. Similarly, they say that they had to buy DAP for Rs14,000 per bag, while its control rate was Rs11,500. Besides these heads, they also had to spend heavily on other inputs, including cultivation, pesticides and tube-well’s electricity bills per acre.
They also lamented that substandard and fake fertilizers and pesticides are sold to them by unscrupulous elements. Despite facing all these hardships, the farmers were not getting official rates for their crop, they deplored. 
Another farmer of Chack 140-P, Zulfiqar Ali, criticised the wheat procurement policy, saying the food department was releasing bags at a ratio of only 16 maunds per acre, while the actual average yield per acre was more than 50 maunds. He said that this means that farmers will be forced to sell the remaining wheat to private traders at lesser rates.Meanwhile, On Wednesday, the rate of wheat crop in the open market was Rs3,250 per maund.
When contacted, DFC Abdul Majid Khan told Dawn that Bardana App will help curb the corruption in food department. He said that policy of wheat procurement was made at secretary level and then approved by provincial cabinet level, so it was beyond his official capacity to address the problems and grievances of farmers.
He said that the 60,000 matric tons target of wheat procurement had not been finalised yet.
About Bardana App he said it won’t close on April 17 and will continue to function “in different phases”.
He admitted that this season the farmer won’t be able to sell all their crop at the support price of Rs3,900 per maund because of the limit of provision of gunny bags for six acres at the ratio of 15 maunds per acre.

Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan urged the opposition to avoid disturbing the house proceedings and instead approach the right forums, courts and Election Commission, for the redressal of their grievances if they had evidence. 
He said the opposition should rather draw the government’s attention towards public issues through the pre-budget discussion.
The opposition boycotted the proceedings and walked out of the house to protest the speaker’s attitude as finance minister Mujtaba Shuja criticised the PTI-SIC MPAs for lacking sportsman spirit contrary to their claims of being followers of a player (Imran Khan).  
Recalling that presiding officers had been kidnapped during by-polls in Narowal when the PTI was in power, he said that those who had voted for the PTI in the Feb 8 general election were dejected seeing the performance of the party and did not vote for it in the by-polls.  
The chair sent ministers Khwaja Salman Rafiq and Shafay Hussain to bring the opposition back.
Earlier, the speaker suspended the house proceedings for five minutes when industries minister Shafay Hussain was ‘missing’ during the question hour about his department.
The sitting restarted only after the minister joined the proceedings.
Responding to a question, Mr Hussain said that he had cancelled 40 plots in an industrial estate last week.  
He said that no new industrial estate would be developed on agricultural lands in future, while the plots of those, who would not install industry within two years of their land allotment, would be cancelled.  
Later, the chair adjourned the proceedings for Wednesday (today) morning.
