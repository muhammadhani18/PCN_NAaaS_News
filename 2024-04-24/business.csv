Fatima Fertiliser Company Ltd (FFCL) on Tuesday raised the price of its brand Sarsabz urea by Rs551 per bag, taking the maximum retail price to Rs4,400.
On April 9, Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd (FFC) increased its urea prices by Rs633 per bag to Rs4,400.
This increase of around 17 per cent has been made even though the gas input cost has remained unchanged.
FFC and FFCL are still receiving gas from the Mari network at a subsidised price of Rs580 per mmBtu compared to other manufacturers on the SSGC and SNGPL networks, which faced a tariff hike to Rs1,597 per mmBtu in February. As a result, price discrimination for the same homogeneous product (gas) has been created in the fertiliser industry.
An official of the affected stakeholders says that this is a missed opportunity for the government, leading to a revenue loss of up to Rs100 billion due to delayed gas reforms that would have standardised gas pricing for all fertiliser manufacturers.
According to him, the only long-term solution to stabilizing urea prices is to eliminate this anomaly in gas pricing among manufacturers. Instability in the fertiliser market also results in excessive profiteering, hoarding, and frustration for the farmer.

1,"Aurangzeb promises bold energy, taxation reforms",Eyes forex reserves close to $10bn by end-June,"ISLAMABAD: Pitching for decade-long political stability and continuity of policies for sustainable economic results, the government on Tuesday promised a series of bold reforms for cheaper and more affordable power rates. It expected official foreign exchange reserves to touch $10bn by June from less than $8bn now.
Speaking at a business conference, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the foreign exchange reserves were expected to cross $9bn as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its last tranche in a week and move closer to $10bn by the end of the fiscal year in June—enough for two months of import cover against a low of $3.4bn or 15-day import cover last year.
He said he had already initiated talks with the IMF for a longer and larger programme to bring permanence to macroeconomic stability and execute a key economic structural reform agenda. “We don’t need policy prescriptions; we know the what and why for a long time, we just don’t do it,” he said and promised the execution of outstanding reforms and their sustainability, particularly in the priority areas of power and petroleum sectors and taxation.
On the taxation side, the finance minister pointed out that the gap between policy and enforcement and the large under-taxed and untaxed sectors must be brought into the tax net. He also noted over Rs1.7 trillion worth of tax proceeds pending litigation.

He highlighted the importance of timely decisions on these litigations and closer cooperation between the centre and the provinces to bring the untaxed sectors into the tax net. At the same time, he stressed the need to bring most of the state-owned entities (SOEs) to the privatisation counter and sought the wholehearted support of all the line ministries concerned instead of dragging their feet.
The finance minister hoped the Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) with the IMF over the next bailout programme by the end of June or early July and said the fund mission would be arriving in the middle of next month for talks.
Power Minister Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari promised bold reforms leading to an affordable, fair, and cheaper energy supply for all without burdening a few with subsidising others. In this regard, he said the government had started a process for converting imported coal-based power plants to local coal to contain foreign exchange loss, and discussions had also begun with all stakeholders on the weighted average cost of gas.
He said the government was also working on regional incentive packages to spur electricity demand as consumers had started moving out of the grid. He said the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had been stopped from entering direct power purchase contracts and would now be replaced with a competitive power procurement system.
National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) would be institutionally restructured quickly, and its role would be changed to power system operator. NTDC’s inefficiencies were causing tremendous loss to the nation, as multiple projects were being delayed for years due to mishandling.
The government is also working on pre-privatisation initiatives for the policy and regulatory framework and minimising the role of power companies in tax collection. If Discos were to work as a tax collection network, then what would the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) do?
The government has no appetite to control Discos and instead would put them in the hands of competent, efficient, and independent boards of directors through a transparent process. Some of the better-managed entities would be given to the private sector through privatisation, and others would be given on long-term concession agreements for improvement.
The private sector has to take its leadership role through participation in the power sector, particularly the distribution system and the government had asked the Pakistan Business Council to give a few experts on how to phase out distribution companies as they had helped at the time of privatisation of PTCL which opened up the sector and earned hundreds of billions of annual revenue to the government against about Rs20bn or so profit then earned by the PTCL.
Mr Leghari said it would not be logical to hamper the growth of the industrial sector just because certain items needed to be subsidised for all classes. The government must be bold enough to accept social responsibility while fostering industrial growth. One “needs to balance supporting industrial development and ensuring that essential items remain affordable for all segments of society. Also, the government is taking measures to restructure electricity tariffs, and he pointed out that cross-subsidies from the industry were unsustainable.
At one of the sessions, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal said peace, stability, and continuity of policies were critical for at least a decade to ensure sustainable economic results. He said Pakistan needed about $70bn repayments over the next three years, and increasing exports to $100bn in eight years would help the country take off economically.

2,Bad loans surge by Rs70bn  in 2023,"Rise in non-performing loans attributed to high interest rates, sluggish economic growth.","KARACHI: The non-performing loans (NPLs) of the banking sector increased by 7.6 per cent, or Rs70 billion, during 2023, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday.
The rise in defaults, influenced by high interest rates and sluggish economic growth, reflects ongoing financial struggles within almost all segments of the economy. Throughout 2023, political instability and economic uncertainties stymied growth across all sectors.
The data, covering December 2022 to December 2023, identified the textile industry as the largest defaulter, contributing significantly to the total NPLs, which escalated from Rs924.04bn in 2022 to Rs994.82bn by the end of 2023. This increase marks a 7.6 per cent rise in bad loans, highlighting a troubling year for the economy.
The textile sector alone saw non-performing loans increase by Rs18bn during the year to a total of Rs182bn.
This sector, critical not only as a major borrower but also as the largest contributor to the country’s export earnings, has been particularly vocal through its industry body, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association. The association has criticised the government’s high utility costs and the record interest rates of 22pc, which they argue severely limit their competitiveness in global markets.

Rise in non-performing loans attributed to high interest rates, sluggish economic growth

Moreover, the private sector’s borrowing from banks dramatically declined, from Rs1,329bn in the previous fiscal year to just Rs208bn in 2023, as businesses were deterred by the costly borrowing conditions and higher risks.
Other sectors, including agribusiness and automotive, also reported increases in non-performing loans. Agribusiness defaults rose to Rs65.9bn, while the auto sector’s defaults increased to Rs19.3bn, attributed to the protracted economic uncertainty and prohibitive interest rates.
Bankers and analysts are cautiously optimistic that the SBP may lower interest rates in its next monetary policy announcement due on April 29.
However, the business community remains sceptical that a reduction of 100 to 200 basis points will be sufficient to rejuvenate the economy. Many are advocating for a significant cut, suggesting rates should be lowered to 10pc to 15pc to reduce the cost of doing business and stimulate economic recovery.

3,"‘Business, industrial activities shrink to 40pc’","Holiday hampers economic activities in Karachi, Lahore.","KARACHI: A number of export-oriented industries opened their units on Tuesday despite a local holiday in the country’s economic nerve centre, which was announced in connection to Iranian President Sayyed Ebrahim Raisi’s visit to the port city.
However, many units could not meet their production and export targets due to a labour shortage and disruption in cargo movement caused by a road blockade for the security of the visiting dignitary.
Besides, trading activities at the main hub of essential commodities — Dandia Bazaar — had also remained subdued due to the closure of main arteries like M.A. Jinnah Road near Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum and Shahra-e-Faisal, which also led to huge traffic jams in the vicinity of the main thoroughfares.
The suspension of cell phone service in some areas has added to the plight of people.

Holiday hampers economic activities in Karachi, Lahore

An industrialist at the Korangi industrial area told Dawn that the Labour Department of Sindh had issued a holiday notice to the industries but exporters had to manage their production activities to meet foreign buyers’ shipment deadlines.
He said the closure of Shahrah-e-Faisal in the afternoon had created a panic-like situation as workers and labourers who arrived on the morning shift had left their respective units. At the same time, the second-shift labour could not reach the industries.
“I have checked that these road blockades have kept production activities and export shipments at only 40 per cent,” he said.
Value Added Textile Forum Chief Coordinator Jawed Bilwani said more than half of the units were closed in the Site area and also in other industrial areas.
“Our production and export shipments suffered a drop of 60pc on Tuesday in the name of security measures,” he said, adding that one can estimate the production and export loss in Karachi, which holds a 54pc share in the country’s total exports.
Similar reports of partial activities were also coming from Lahore due to the local holiday announced to provide security to the visiting Iranian president. “Lahore enjoys a share of 20pc in the country’s total exports,” he claimed.
“What can exporters do in such a situation? I do not know what is going on in the country,” he said, referring to the closure of the city’s main arteries, forcing labourer living in far-flung areas to stay at their homes.
Faisal Anis Majeed, a commodity importer/exporter, said some 15-20pc shops were open in the Dandia Bazaar as traders and labourers failed to reach due to the closure of the M.A. Jinnah Road and Sharea Faisal, followed by traffic gridlocks. Some traders had also kept their offices closed.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Johar Qandhari, while extending a warm welcome to the Iranian president’s visit to Pakistan, expressed optimism that the visit would not only mend past tensions but also enhance trade and brotherly relations between the two nations.
He highlighted the untapped trade opportunities between Pakistan and Iran and stressed the need for a concerted effort to bolster economic cooperation.

6,Stocks turn in depressed performance,Analyst attributes the depressed market performance to the expectations of prudent SBP monetary policy announce­ment next week ahead of new IMF loan talks.,"KARACHI: After scaling an all-time high overnight, the benchmark KSE 100 index faltered despite a positive start on Tuesday amid reports of oil refining units shutting down and Shanghai Electric Power’s withdrawal of an offer to buy K-Electric.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation attributed the depressed market performance to the expectations of prudent SBP monetary policy announce­ment next week ahead of new IMF loan talks and strong opposition to the petroleum price deregulation model by the refineries which have started closing down their units amid storage constraints and weak sales due to rampant smuggling.
He said there was uncertainty over Pakis­tan-US relations following the signing of trade pacts with Iran to increase bilateral annual trade volume to $10 billion over the next five years, dampening investor sentiments.
Topline Securities Ltd said equities began the day on a positive note, with across-the-board buying in cyclical stocks, especially in the cement sector, in the backdrop of the current surplus of $619m and anticipation of inflation clocking in at 17-18pc for April. 
It said the street expectations are scattered from “status quo” to a 50-100bps cut in the SBP policy rate, and any reduction would further fuel the recent bullish momentum at the stock market.
However, at the day’s high level, some investors opted to take profits, dragging the market into the red. 
The cement, bank, and automobile sectors contributed positively to the index, as Lucky Cement, United Bank Ltd, Habib Bank Ltd, Millat Tractor Ltd and Maple Leaf Cement added 161 points, cumulatively. 
On the other hand, Meezan Bank, Faysal Bank Ltd, and Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd received some beating, losing 135 points cumulatively. 
As a result, the index hit the day’s high at 71,861.18, gaining 413 points, but closed in the red at 71,359.41 points after losing 74.06 points, or 0.10pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume stayed flat at 655.93 million shares. However, the traded value dipped 21.64pc to Rs24.48bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Elec­tric (67.16m shares), PIBTL (46.34m shares), Fauji Cem­ent Company Ltd (45.92m shares), Pak Elektron Ltd (41.28m shares) and Maple Leaf Cement Factory Ltd (24.16m shares).
Foreign investors remained net buyers as they picked shares worth $1.24m.
